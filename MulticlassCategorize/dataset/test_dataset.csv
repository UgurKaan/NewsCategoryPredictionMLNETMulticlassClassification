ARTS & CULTURE,"Modeling Agencies Enabled Sexual Predators For Years, Former Agent Says","In October 2017, Carolyn Kramer received a disturbing phone call. The former modeling agent listened intently as a model she used to represent told her that a famous French photographer, who still shoots for top publications, raped her when she was 16. Shortly after meeting the man at a restaurant in 1983, the model said she blacked out after drinking one glass of champagne, then woke up in his bed the next morning with a sore and bruised vagina. The woman, who preferred to remain anonymous, confirmed this story with HuffPost, but did not want to name the photographer for fear of legal repercussions. “He was one of the photographers that agents and clients and young girls basically knew was lecherous,” Kramer said, claiming that she and other agents sent their models to him in the ’80s anyway. “[But] what I didn’t realize [at the time] is that he was raping girls.”  Kramer said she broke down crying after the woman relayed her story of assault. “In that moment I felt that I let down the models who I represented over the course of 20 years,” she said. “It made me feel like, here it is in front of my face now and I didn’t do anything to change [it.]” It’s been 14 years since Kramer left the fashion business. But throughout the two decades she spent working as a modeling agent in New York City in the 1980s, ’90s and early 2000s, Kramer said she knew about rampant sexual misconduct in her industry ― and didn’t protect her models from the egregious behavior. Now, amid the domino-like fall of so many high-profile alleged sexual offenders, the 58-year-old can’t stop thinking about how she and other agents sent girls, some as young as 13, to modeling gigs with photographers who were rumored to be sexual predators. So in October, the former agent decided to speak out.  “Many of these girls who are assaulted [as models] aren’t older than 15 years old,” she wrote in a Facebook post. “And I stand here to say how ashamed I am of myself for not having had the tools or the resources or guts to stop it.” Kramer’s peers queued up in the post’s comments section to corroborate her story. One of her former colleagues, ex-model Kristen Noel, said her agency, Elite Model Management, sent her to Paris in the early ’80s to stay with an agent who repeatedly groped and forcibly kissed her. She was 16. “Elite protected him and disconnected from their responsibility to me,” Noel told HuffPost.  Another commenter, hair and makeup artist Dawn Jacobson, said she saw agencies regularly endanger models when she worked in Milan in the ’80s. According to her, companies sent young women to live in residences ― one of which was reportedly known as “Clitoride,” Italian for “clitoris” ― where they were preyed on by wealthy Italian men. “I think the agencies have massive culpability because they don’t necessarily care about anything other than who gets the booking,” the 59-year-old, who still works in fashion, told HuffPost. “It becomes a little bit of a human trafficking kind of thing.” Kramer’s post, her first public denouncement of the sexual harassment and abuse she’d witnessed and heard about in the fashion industry, clearly struck a nerve. As the #MeToo revolution continues to spark a national dialogue on sexual misconduct, the former agent wants to expose exactly how the very modeling agencies she worked for enabled predators, a disturbing reality that she believes still exists today.  Kramer, a New Jersey native, doesn’t seem like the type to stay silent. She has a self-described “big personality” and speaks bluntly with a slight New York accent. In a recent Facebook profile photo, she’s wearing a shirt that reads “Fuck Trump” and raising her middle finger. But since she retired from the fashion world in 2004, Kramer said she felt like nobody ― primarily, the media ― was interested in what she had to say.  Only recently, the former agent noted, have news outlets begun systematically covering the kinds of abuse allegations she wants to condemn. It’s true that sexual assault accusations made against fashion photographer Terry Richardson date back to 2001, and that he was only officially dropped by certain top magazines and brands in October 2017. (Richardson has long denied any nonconsensual behavior.) And while at least 18 current and former male models recently accused famed photographer Bruce Weber of sexual harassment (Weber has denied these claims), one of whom has filed a lawsuit, industry insiders claim there is a long list of predators who still thrive in a largely unregulated profession that combines young models, big male egos and drugs.  Kramer’s story dates back to 1983, when she was hired by the industry’s top agency, Elite Model Management, as an assistant booking agent in New York. Her previous fashion industry jobs had been horrible. Kramer once worked with a photographer who she said cornered her in his office and tried to forcibly kiss her. And she worked for Foster-Fell Model Management, which she called a “slimy, horrible” agency.  “The models were basically prostitutes,” she said. ”[The owner] would have parties I would be at with licentious business men who were only there to fuck the models.” (Jeremy Foster-Fell, who co-founded the now-defunct agency in 1970, denied these claims to HuffPost. “To say there was an arrangement of financial exchange and sexual favors would be completely out of whack,” he said, adding, however, that “if you’re looking after a whole bunch of good-looking ladies who are running around Manhattan, you’re going to be running into trouble here and there sometimes.”)  But at 24, Kramer found herself employed by the modeling world’s gold standard, an agency that represented Cindy Crawford and Linda Evangelista, where she didn’t expect to encounter abusive men. Her transition to Elite was “like going from community college to Harvard,” she said. Sadly, Kramer’s optimism was quickly dashed.  At Elite New York, her job frequently involved booking models on “go-sees,” the name for appointments during which photographers or designers scout new faces for upcoming shoots. In these meetings, vulnerable young women’s success often depends on impressing (mostly) powerful men. Kramer said she and other Elite agents would send models, who in many cases were under 16 and had never been to New York City, on appointments with nothing more than subway fare and a map. According to Kramer, the girls mostly went alone, because at the time there were no laws requiring guardians to accompany underage models on shoots. New York passed a bill in 2013 that, among other things, requires models under 16 to have chaperones. But before that, a 2012 study by Model Alliance, an organization that advocates for labor rights in fashion, found that 52 percent of models are rarely or never accompanied by guardians to a shoot, despite the fact that the majority of models start working between age 13 and 16. Kramer quickly learned about the perils of go-sees and photo shoots. Though the former agent says that the models she represented at the time didn’t tell her directly about being sexually harassed or assaulted by photographers ― likely, she said, because they were terrified of losing job opportunities ― Kramer soon heard through industry gossip with colleagues who the predators were. “I wouldn’t have even called it a secret,” she said. “It was just sort of common hearsay that this list of photographers were pigs...I had to make the appointments with [these men]. It would make me gag, but I had to do my job or I’d be fired.”  Another Elite employee, Marie Anderson Boyd, who was an agent and vice president at the company’s Chicago office between 1985 and 1990, said models would regularly tell her about the sexual misconduct they experienced on go-sees. ”[Some photographers] will think nothing of walking over to some teen girl who’s brand new to the business, taking her top off, unbuttoning her bra and saying something like, ‘I want you to look at me and think of ... giving me oral sex,’” she said. “And a lot of girls have never even done that [before], so they don’t even know what the [photographers] mean.”  Anderson Boyd said she never told her managers at Elite about the models’ abusive stories, in part because executives like John Casablancas and Gerald Marie also allegedly engaged in misconduct. “They established a culture of compliance with sexually predatory behavior,” she said. “That trickled down into everything everybody did.”  Indeed, during Kramer’s first year at Elite, the agency’s late founder, the then-41-year-old Casablancas, was having a public affair with an underage model named Stephanie Seymour. Kramer was horrified that Casablancas, with his movie-star good looks and “intoxicating” charisma, was committing statutory rape.  “As a young little upstart, I was very in awe of him,” she said. “But at the same time I’m thinking to myself, Stephanie’s supposed to be at a Vogue shooting at 9 a.m. and she’s still in bed with John. I thought it was wrong and I honestly couldn’t believe it went on. It made me sick.” Other alleged abuses at Elite unfurled from there. Gerald Marie, the head of Elite Paris, was in his 30s when he allegedly raped a 17-year-old model named Carré Otis on multiple occasions, which she detailed in her 2011 memoir. At the time, Otis was temporarily staying with him while she was modeling abroad in the mid-’80s. She didn’t feel as though she could tell the agency about the abuse.  “When [Elite] New York said goodbye to me and put me in Gerald’s apartment, he was like my new owner,” Otis told HuffPost. “There was no one in New York who created a connection with me and said, ‘Hey, here’s the way it should go, and if it doesn’t go this way, here’s a number to call.’ It was just really a hand-off.” “There was a below-the-radar understanding that the [executives] of Elite [Casablancas and Marie] were sleeping with young women,” Kramer said. “I’m working at an agency where statutory rape is in front of my face and yet I can’t do anything.” Kramer said at 24 she herself was groped by a high-profile agent who went on to become an Elite executive. “I was sitting on his lap and his hands were all over me, coming around [my waist] and trying to grab my breast,” she said. “I didn’t react because I was so accustomed to seeing photographers be touchy-feely with models.” Kramer did not tell anyone at Elite about the misconduct, because she said it never occurred to her that such commonplace behavior was worth reporting, never mind addressing. And those who tried to call out problematic behavior didn’t get very far. In 2000, Anderson Boyd told New York Magazine that she remembered watching two female executives plead with Marie and Casablancas to stop sleeping with underage women. Anderson Boyd says Marie’s response was, “We are men. We have our needs.” “I was grossed out by what was happening,” the 59-year-old told HuffPost. “And that’s why I quit.” Ultimately, Anderson Boyd and Kramer agreed that Elite never trained agents to speak with models about sexual misconduct. Both women say they and other agents they knew did not prepare models for how to deal with predatory behavior.   “It was not handled like a traditional corporation where you’re handed a sexual harassment manual,” Anderson Boyd said. “I did not know how to help [the models’] working conditions.” Their account matches the experiences of women at other agencies at the time. For example, when former model Lesa Amoore was 17, she said her agent at the now-defunct Riccardo Gay Model Management company warned her that a photographer she was about to shoot with in Milan could “be a little weird.” Amoore said that during the subsequent shoot, when she was wearing only a bra and underwear, the photographer unzipped his pants, pulled out his penis and asked whether he could masturbate. According to the former model, now 48, she put on her clothes and ran out of the room. Amoore said that when she told her agent about the photographer’s behavior, he responded, “I’m so sorry, that happens sometimes with him.” Sara Ziff, who began modeling at age 14 in the late ’90s and later founded Model Alliance, told The New York Times last year that she too was regularly asked by photographers to get naked or topless without prior warning and, in at least one instance, was told to sit on her male booker’s lap.  “When I first started modeling, I did not feel protected by my agency [Next Management],” she told HuffPost. “In some cases, I felt like they were facilitating meetings [with powerful people] that were not clearly work opportunities ― they felt more like being set up on a date.” Though the modeling industry is now more regulated than it was in decades past, abuse is reportedly still frequent. A whopping 87 percent of models say they’ve been asked to get naked without prior warning, while 30 percent have experienced “inappropriate touching” on the job and 28 percent have been pressured to have sex at work, according to Model Alliance. Model Cameron Russell’s Instagram is filled with her own colleagues’ stories of being preyed on at go-sees and shoots. A 22-year-old model wrote about how a male photographer pulled down her bra and started kissing her breasts six months ago. Another woman recalled how, as a 14-year-old model, a photographer made her change in front of him, rubbed oil on her legs, and, after asking if she was a virgin, said, “You make me want to go to jail.” The collection of horror stories portrays male photographers masturbating in front of young models, asking for sexual favors, and, in one case, penetrating a 15-year-old with his finger to make the photos “look more sensual.” Ziff said that beyond adhering to the 2013 bill, even the best-intentioned agencies still don’t have firm policies in place to protect their models from sexual misconduct. “They tell the girls that if they are in a situation that feels uncomfortable: ‘Go to the bathroom and walk out,’ ‘Feel free to call me,’ and ‘You don’t have to do anything you don’t want to do,’” the 35-year-old explained. “[They should] take a preventative approach that doesn’t allow those situations to happen in the first place. It’s much easier said than done to walk out of a shoot, especially if you’re young, maybe English isn’t your first language, and you’re working with someone who could make or break your career.”  In fact, Model Alliance found that 70 percent of models surveyed didn’t feel they could report sexual misconduct to their agencies. Of those who did, two-thirds said their agents didn’t consider the behavior problematic, and, in a few cases, even encouraged models to sleep with predators to advance their careers.  Model Jason Boyce, who filed a lawsuit against Bruce Weber for sexual misconduct last year, is also suing his agency, Soul Artist Management. According to the court filing, Boyce claimed the agency knew about Weber’s predatory behavior and alleged that his agent told him to “nail” his shoot with the famous photographer. “The culture was: You did what you were told. That was how they sold it,” he said in an interview with The Business of Fashion. “If you do what I tell you, you’ll make it. ... My agent told me that all the time.” Jilian Gotlib, a manager and booking agent who worked for Elite in the ’80s and re-joined the company in 2005, spoke to HuffPost on behalf of the organization. She disputed Kramer’s assertion that agents knowingly sent models to photographers who were rumored to be sexual predators, suggesting that Kramer “goes overboard, maybe, with criticizing the industry.” “We would always be careful, check out [the photographer] and tell our models, ‘If [the photographers] ask you to do anything that we didn’t tell you was going to happen, let us know,’” she explained. “Some girls would just go ahead anyway, but we would always warn people: ‘Call me if anything seems untoward.’ I think we would try not to work with a lot of those photographers if we heard problems.” Trudi Tapscott, who worked as an agent and director at Elite from the early ’80s until the early ’90s, reiterated Gotlib’s point, explaining that she told young women about potentially creepy photographers ahead of time. “I’ve had very honest conversations [about] what to do when [photographers] do this and what to do when [photographers] do that,” she told HuffPost. However, Tapscott added: “At this point I consider [those conversations] complicit. But then I thought I was helping them survive, which sounds so stupid now.” As for alleged in-house predators such as Marie, Gotlib said, “I knew nothing about anything that might have been going on there.”  Throughout her career Kramer worked at four other agencies ― the now-defunct Name Management and Company Management, as well as Next Management and the Marilyn Model Agency ― where she said she also regularly witnessed young girls being preyed on at dinner parties and clubs. She said agencies organized events at hot spots such as New York’s Indochine or the Ritz in Paris, where models mingled in clouds of cigarette smoke with important editors and photographers who could “make or break careers.” “I saw 14- and 15-year-olds sitting on the laps of these photographers,” she said. “These guys would just have their hands all over these girls.” Ultimately, Kramer said she didn’t think she could call out the complicit behavior without losing her job. “Working for Elite [and the other agencies] manipulated me into thinking it was OK,” she said. “I’m not trying to squiggle out of this, by the way. I’m sick to my stomach that I was part of this poison. It sickens me.”  Representatives for Next Management and the Marilyn Model Agency did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. Kramer left the industry in 2004 when she was working at the Marilyn Model Agency, saying she was disgusted by how young the models had become. But the former agent said she didn’t process the sexual misconduct ― or her role in enabling it ― until the following year, when she planned to write a book about her career. “I really started becoming more in touch with, ‘Holy shit, what did I do? What did I see? What did I feel? What did I know?’” she said. Kramer never wrote the book, but since her October Facebook post, models have contacted her with more and more stories recalling sexual harassment and assault in the fashion world. Even before posting on social media, Kramer had started working with Ziff at Model Alliance to publicize industry abuse. The organization recently proposed a program to address sexual misconduct in the fashion, entertainment and media industries that would, among other things, have a third party provide sexual harassment training and implement proper complaint procedures. But Kramer says agents still working in the business aren’t embracing her efforts. “A lot of people aren’t talking to me anymore because they know I’m on top of this,” she said. “They are afraid of losing their standing with these photographers and editors.” There are still many “Terry Richardsons” in the industry, Kramer said, men whose predatory behavior the fashion world ignores. “We all knew Terry Richardson was sexually abusing these girls and yet we still kept sending them on go-sees and to the bookings themselves,” she said. “If you’ve got a $20 million Revlon contract weighing in the balance ... yet you know Terry is abusing these girls, what do we do? Do we say no to Terry? No, [we] don’t.” Moving forward, Kramer believes that if executives at top agencies spoke out about malpractice, they could truly force industrywide change. Kramer also thinks agencies need to stop accepting models under 16, but at the very least, she urges them to better protect young women against possible predators.  “If I could get the owners to say to themselves, ‘Maybe we shouldn’t send 14-year-olds out on go-sees,’ and, ‘Maybe we should make sure these photographers that are on the blacklist are never alone with a model,’ I would feel my own shame and guilt for not having done more when I was an agent [slightly dissipate],” she said. “[Then] maybe I’d be able to let myself off the hook a little bit.” Do you have a story about harassment or discrimination that you’d like to share?

ARTS & CULTURE,New Yorker Cover Puts Trump 'In The Hole' After 'Racist' Comment,"The New Yorker is taking on President Donald Trump after he asked why the U.S. would welcome immigrants from “shithole” places like Haiti and African countries during a bipartisan Oval Office meeting on Thursday. “In the Hole,” by artist Anthony Russo, responds to the president’s comment, which has been decried as racist by the United Nations, with a stark illustration for the magazine’s cover in its Jan. 22 issue.  On a field of white, the president’s yellowish sweep of hair is just visible from the depths of a black hole: On Thursday, Trump sparked widespread criticism after he reportedly questioned why the U.S. should restore protections for immigrants from Haiti and parts of Africa. “Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?” the president said, sources told The Washington Post. “We should have more people from places like Norway,” he added. The New York Times, NBC News, BuzzFeed and CNN confirmed reports of the comment. Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) went on record to say he was in the room when it was made. “He said these hate-filled things and he said them repeatedly,” Durbin said. The White House did not deny the president’s phrasing in a statement issued Thursday. Trump strongly denied the derogatory remark against Haiti over Twitter the next day, but neither he nor the White House mentioned his attitude toward African nations.   Lawmakers were in the Oval Office to discuss a plan to help “Dreamers,” the undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children who are nicknamed after the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program that protected them from deportation. Trump ended DACA in September, but has said he wants to help Dreamers in exchange for progress on his proposed border wall.  CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article misspelled Russo’s last name and misidentified Russo as the artist behind a New Yorker cover depicting James Comey being dragged off a plane by Jeff Sessions, which was illustrated by Barry Blitt. "
ARTS & CULTURE,Man Surprises Girlfriend By Drawing Them In Different Animation Styles,"Kellen Hickey, a 26-year-old who lives in Hudson, Wisconsin, has gift giving down to a fine art. He drew himself and his girlfriend Lindsay Brinkman, 24, in 10 different animation styles and gave the illustrations to her on Christmas. Hickey told HuffPost that he got the idea a few months ago when he decided to draw the couple as “Futurama” and “Adventure Time” characters and Brinkman absolutely loved them. Her enthusiasm inspired him to draw the two of them in the style of all the cartoons they had bonded over since they began dating in high school. “I am fortunate enough to have the ability to create something that can represent us and our enjoyment of each one of those shows relatively faithfully,” Hickey told HuffPost. “But I have to admit, the “Dragon Ball Z-style drawing was kind of for me.” Hickey says that Brinkman’s response to the gift on Christmas was “everything I could’ve hoped for.” “As soon as she finished [looking through the drawings she] jump-hugged me and was sure to remind me of how much she loves me for the next hour or so.” Proud of his work, Hickey posted the drawings on his Instagram account earlier this week, where they’ve since gotten a lot of attention online. The couple has framed nine of the photos and have them hanging in their living room. Hickey says Brinkman’s favorite is the “Bob’s Burgers” illustration. The “Dragon Ball Z”-version of the couple is sitting in a frame on Hickey’s work desk. “I’m not sure I could ever properly express how much she inspires me,” Hickey told HuffPost. “None of this would have happened if it weren’t for her, her support and the love between us,” he said."
ARTS & CULTURE,This Artist Gives Renaissance-Style Sculptures A Goofy Modern Twist,"There’s something about combining the traditional, uptight look of the Renaissance period with modern-day behavior that excites Barcelona-based artist Gerard Mas. His resulting creations mix the ancient art of sculpting with satirical elements of contemporary pop art. “I thought about the millions of attitudes and situations that old artworks couldn’t capture, because they were simply inappropriate for a lady in the 15th century,” Mas told Vice. Mas added that “inappropriate” behavior himself. Check out some of the examples below, and visit Mas’ site to see more of his inventive artwork.

ARTS & CULTURE,This Dutch 23-Year-Old Epitomizes The Future Of American Filmmaking,"Joosje Duk has a sweater that reads “DON’T PANIC.” She wears it on days when she might, well, panic.  “I always tell my family, if this all doesn’t work out, I’ll go study math when I’m 28, and I’ll be fine,” she said, because math seems like an effortless career path, right? It is, depending on your perspective, more effortless than filmmaking, Duk’s chosen trade. But less than a year after she graduated from NYU, the 23-year-old Netherlands native, who at 17 moved to the United States for college, is doing all right: Her thesis project, a short film called “Night,” has screened at festivals in New York, Chicago, Connecticut, Florida, Boston, Nashville and the Netherlands. Her career, in other words, is beginning the same way that many contemporary directors’ careers began, including that of Paul Thomas Anderson, an auteur she’d like to emulate, whose 1993 short “Cigarettes & Coffee” led to a Hollywood deal that birthed his first feature, “Hard Eight.”  In November, HuffPost screened about three dozen shorts playing at Brooklyn’s Nitehawk Shorts Festival; we chose “Night” as the recipient of our annual Impact Award, given to a submission with social or political resonance. As it turns out, the prize reflects Duk well. Despite taking a liking to physics and chemistry as a teenager, her early studies at NYU focused on journalism and theater (with a little math tossed in for good measure, of course). In both arenas, she was drawn to subjects that let her double as something of an activist, namely portraits of racism, mental health and other travails. A screenwriting course and a directing course helped to crystallize her path: Duk would use a journalistic lens to tell fictional stories about everyday struggles. She is, in other words, a fabulist with a progressive perspective on cinema’s ability to deliver messages and unearth truths about the world. “Night” is loosely based on a transaction Duk observed. While waiting outside a nightclub in France, she watched bouncers usher one white person after the next through the door ― until a group of Moroccan guys were inexplicably denied entrance. Duk felt conflicted. Should she speak out? Or would the men prefer to avoid further embarrassment? What is her duty as a bystander witnessing ostensible racism? Even in New York, a city known as a live-and-let-live playground, Duk said she and her “diverse” group of friends frequently encounter microagressions related to their genders and racial identities. These aren’t the sort of crimes that would make headlines or result in physical harm; instead, they’re the mild exchanges that make women, people of color and queer folks feel uneasy, judged.  Duk poured these experiences into “Night,” scripting a nine-minute tale that begins as a bubbly, somewhat surreal jaunt and ends as a poignant bait-and-switch about racial profiling. In the opening seconds, a pair of young white women arrive at an apartment where two woman of color are preparing for an evening out in New York City. Outside a nightclub, a black bouncer admits the two black women without a fuss. But the white women, one of whom is visiting from the small South American country Suriname, are turned away, until one of the black women bribes the bouncer with $40. Later in the night, the women recount the events, when suddenly Duk implants a twist that deepens the racial themes. (You can watch “Night” below.)  The ironic shift that occurs more than halfway through the short evokes a mastery commonly associated with more experienced filmmakers. “Night” boasts a narrative sophistication that’s impressive for someone who didn’t grow up a cinephile, who, during our conversation, pulled up a document on her laptop with a long list of movies she still needs to see, like “Little Miss Sunshine” (her friends keep insisting it’s in line with her own sensibilities), “Heathers,” “Requiem for a Dream” (she loved “mother!,” also a Darren Aronosfky film), “Big Fish” and the Japanese drama “Late Spring.”  “Initially the story wasn’t written with the characters swapped,” Duk explained. “It was just the two black girls being rejected in an all-white world. When we were rehearsing it and rereading it and I was sharing it with people, it felt a little too preachy, and a little too much like, ‘Look, here’s what’s wrong,’ which often takes people away from something because they’re like, ‘I know, I know, but that’s not me.’ Whereas this was more about misleading the audience and giving them no choice but to feel what it’s like to be in these girls’ shoes. [...] It invites people to look at their own prejudice.” Since graduating in May 2016, Duk has been busy assisting a documentarian, creating a Dutch web series and completing a fellowship with the NYU Production Lab, where alumni receive mentorship while completing creative projects. There, she finessed a feature-length script that stems from an idea born at age 16, when her best friend revealed she was grappling with depression. While learning about her pal’s mental health, she envisioned a story about a town where it rains every day. Bright umbrellas are the ultimate accessory, but the protagonist slowly loses her ability to see color. Thinking she’s the only one suffering from this chromatic deficiency, she internalizes her pain ― just like many suffering from depression and other ailments.  Without having read the script or seen the film, called “Sunshowers,” it’s easy to draw a parallel to “Night,” both in its social consciousness and its surreal premise. The aesthetics are baked into the logline, with pops of color fading in a largely grayscale setting. Once her script is ready, Duk’s main challenge, it seems, will come in financing the film and securing its distribution ― the tasks school can’t prepare you for.  But “DON’T PANIC” remains Duk’s mantra. Things seem to work out for the tall brunette, who has a warm energy and an endearing accent. Back in the Hague, for example, when she was in a play at 15, a casting director pegged her for the lead in a children’s television series called “Snuf the Dog.” Because the arts, she said, aren’t treated as seriously in the Netherlands as they are in America, it was then that Duk first conceptualized acting as a viable profession. In a way, “Night” and “Sunshowers” and the “DON’T PANIC” incantation are extensions of that realization. All the best artists pour their formative experiences into their work, but Duk takes that one step further, channeling the tribulations of those around her. She is, as Roger Ebert might say, an empathy machine. “Growing up, I saw a lot of commercial movies that I enjoyed, but I never thought of filmmaking as a medium where you could tell stories that have an impact on a social or societal level, at all, until I came here,” she said, referring to the States. “It’s like, oh, filmmaking is not just entertainment —it’s also a way to reach a large audience and spread a message that people aren’t hearing yet or don’t want to hear yet, or show places that people aren’t familiar with yet.” The fifth annual Nitehawk Shorts Festival took place in Brooklyn, New York, last year, during which HuffPost served as the event’s media partner."
ARTS & CULTURE,Broadway Actor Ben Vereen Accused Of Sexual Assault In 2015 'Hair' Production,"Multiple women have accused Broadway star Ben Vereen of sexual misconduct ranging from harassment to assault, according to a Friday morning report from the New York Daily News. The alleged sexual misconduct happened during Vereen’s tenure as director of the 2015 production of “Hair” at the Venice Theatre program outside of Tampa, Florida. Vereen, who was 69 at the time, held open auditions for the production and later managed the 32-person volunteer cast. Four female cast members told the New York Daily News that Vereen repeatedly and forcibly kissed and hugged them without their consent. Several other cast members corroborated their experiences, telling the New York Daily News that Vereen routinely made degrading comments about female cast members’ bodies during rehearsals and one time stripped naked with the cast during what he called an acting exercise.  Two of the four women alleged that Vereen invited them separately over to his home in September 2015 for “private rehearsals.” During these two incidences, Vereen allegedly coerced the women into getting naked and asked them to join him in the hot tub. According to the two accounts, Vereen pressed his erect penis into the women’s legs and made unwanted sexual advances.  “He was acting as my mentor, asking me about my parents, then that same night, he put me on his lap while I was crying, and I felt his erection,” Kaitlyn Terpstra, who was 22 at the time, told the New York Daily News.  “He asked me, ‘Feel that?’ It was terrifying. I said, ‘Feel what?’ I wanted to act like I didn’t. I pushed myself off with a laugh,” she continued. “Then later, he asked, ‘Do you think I want to fuck you?’ I said ‘Yes,’ and he got angry. He said, ‘Well, I don’t, and that’s unfortunate.’ He made me feel like I had my mind in the gutter.” The other woman, identified only as “Kim,” told the New York Daily News Vereen asked her to perform oral sex while they were in his hot tub. Kim, who was only 23 at the time, said she acquiesced and recalled feeling “confused.” “I didn’t feel like I had a choice,” she said. Kim said she willingly entered into a relationship with Vereen after that first encounter. Now, however, she believes it was because he manipulated and took advantage of her.  Vereen starred in the original Broadway production of “Hair” between 1968 and 1972, alternating between the roles of Claude and Hud. Many of the 2015 cast members (all of whom were volunteers looking to jumpstart their acting careers) said that they were in awe of Vereen’s iconic role and subsequent successful career, which made it easier for him to take advantage of them.    In a statement to HuffPost, Vereen did not deny the accusations and apologized for his actions: I would like to apologize directly to the female cast members of the musical Hair for my inappropriate conduct when I directed the production in 2015. While it was my intention to create an environment that replicated the themes of that musical during the rehearsal process, I have since come to understand that it is my conduct, not my intentions, which are relevant here. So I am not going to make any excuses because the only thing that matters here is acknowledging and apologizing for the effects of my conduct on the lives of these women. Going forward, my having come to terms with my past conduct will inform all my future interactions not only with women, but with all individuals. I hope these women will find it in their hearts to accept my sincere apology and forgive me. Murray Chase, executive director of the Venice Theatre, told New York Daily News that the theater is “working to strengthen our sexual harassment policies and procedures, including the reporting of them, to prevent any future occurrences.” "
ARTS & CULTURE,Sculptures From This International Ice And Snow Festival Are Mind-Boggling,"The world’s largest ice festival began this week in Harbin, a city in the northeastern part of China. The Harbin International Ice and Snow Festival goes through late February and features thousands of ice sculptures. The most spectacular of these works are the massive and elaborate recreations of castles, historic landmarks and famous figures, lit up at night in dazzling bright colors. Eighteen million people attended last year’s festival. This year, besides subzero temperatures, attendees can expect an ice replica of Moscow’s Red Square and Bangkok’s Temple of the Emerald Buddha, as well as works by artist Han Zhenkun based on the country’s famous Silk Road. Here are some photos of the eye-catching festival as it kicks off."
ARTS & CULTURE,The Met Museum Is Changing Its Pay-As-You-Wish Admission Policy,"Non-New Yorkers officially have less than two months to take advantage of the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s pay-as-you-wish admission policy.  Tourists will be charged a mandatory entrance fee starting March 1, The Met announced Thursday. The public museum hasn’t charged a mandatory entrance fee for nearly 50 years.  Under the updated policy, visitors from outside of New York state will pay what are currently suggested admission prices: $25 for adults, $17 for seniors and $12 for students. Kids under 12 will still get in for free.  The museum said New York residents and students from New Jersey and Connecticut will be allowed to follow the current pay-as-you-wish guidance if they can show proof of residence.  Under The Met's updated policy, all NY-state residents and NY, NJ, and CT students will remain pay-as-you-wish, all children under 12 remain free, and visitors from outside New York State will be required to pay an admissions fee. https://t.co/m9Uc7nQrPs pic.twitter.com/A1EbmUCa05 The change is expected to affect about 31 percent of the Met’s annual visitors, Daniel H. Weiss, the museum’s president and CEO, wrote Thursday in a blog post.  Visits to the museum have increased by more than 40 percent over the last eight years, Weiss said ― but the number of guests paying the full suggested admission fee has declined by 73 percent over the last 13 years.  “We are now the only major museum in the world that relies exclusively on a pure pay-as-you-wish system or that does not receive the majority of its funding from the government,” he wrote. “What is clear is that our current pay-as-you-wish policy is no longer sufficient to meet the Museum’s daily operational demands,” he added. “Paid admissions represent only 14 percent of our overall revenue, one of the lowest percentages among our New York City peers.” Weiss said the museum considered its role as an educational resource before making its decision. Still, many critics have argued that the Met should keep its current entrance policy.  Hey @NYCMayor pls work to stop this. This will harm young people, families, and folks who aren't of the ownership class. Pay-as-you-go was critical to me as a young person to see art. Why only let the rich have access? https://t.co/KmNKkOFMv7 will NYers now be asked “Papers, please” at the gates of the Met? https://t.co/KLNlMA8ZZB The Metropolitan Museum of Art sits on public land, in a building owned by the city. It's repugnant that the city agreed to this change. Two of The New York Times’ chief art critics voiced their concerns in an lengthy piece on Thursday. “I’m instinctively suspicious of, and resistant to, ‘carding’ procedures, meaning any admission policy based on presenting personal identification, which is what the Met is asking for from New York State residents who want to keep paying what they wish,” art critic Holland Cotter wrote.  “This potentially discriminates against a population of residents who either don’t have legal identification or are reluctant to show the identification they have,” he added. “And it plays directly into the hands of the anti-immigrant sentiment that is now poisoning this country. I cannot remember a time when a museum’s unqualified demonstration of ‘doors open to all’ would carry more positive — I would say necessary — political weight. This is my single biggest reservation about the Met’s admission-by-I.D. policy.” Fellow art critic Roberta Smith agreed, saying she worried that the “Met’s plan is classist, and nativist.”   “If libraries started charging entrance fees there would be a great uproar,” she wrote. “We don’t have to pay for access to publicly owned books, and we shouldn’t have to pay to see art in museums whose nonprofit status is supported by our taxes.” It was first reported in April 2017 that the Met was in talks with the city about changing its admission policy. The museum faced a multimillion-dollar budget deficit that was at least partly caused by financial mismanagement. The deficit has gone down, but The New York Times reports that it still hovers around $10 million. "
ARTS & CULTURE,"Duncan Jones Finds A Literary Way To Remember His Father, David Bowie","David Bowie’s cultural legacy continues. The legendary musician’s son, movie director Duncan Jones, has launched an online book club in honor of his late father. Bowie died at age 69 in January 2016 following an 18-month struggle with cancer. “My dad was a beast of a reader,” Jones tweeted last week. “I’ve been feeling a building sense of duty to go on the same literary marathon in tribute to dad.” Jones then revealed that the first book the “Bowie Book Club” discusses would be English author Peter Ackroyd’s 1985 crime novel Hawskmoor. Alright gang!  Anyone who wants to join along, we are reading Peter Ackroyd’s “Hawksmoor,” as an amuse cerveau before we get into the heavy stuff.  You have until Feb 1. ❤️ It would be “an amuse cerveau before we get into the heavy stuff,” Jones joked, adding that people had until Feb. 1 to read it. Membership of the club appears to be free and flexible. Jones told one tweeter who asked how to join that the person “just did,” indicating it was open to anyone on Twitter who wanted to read and then discuss the book.  Bowie’s official website revealed his “Top 100 Books” in 2013. Hawksmoor appeared on the list, alongside other illustrious titles such as The Brief Wondrous Life Of Oscar Wao by Junot Diaz, The Stranger by Albert Camus, and On The Road by Jack Kerouac. (Check out the full list here.) It’s not clear whether Jones will stick to the list for future book club picks, however. A post shared by David Bowie (@davidbowie) on Dec 28, 2017 at 2:20pm PST"
ARTS & CULTURE,Mystery Novelist Sue Grafton Dead At 77,"Sue Grafton, who authored “The Kinsey Millhone Alphabet” mystery series, died Thursday in Santa Barbara, California, after a battle with cancer, her daughter announced on the writer’s Facebook page Friday. She was 77. Grafton began the “Kinsey Millhone” books ― which take their titles from each letter of the alphabet ― with A is for Alibi back in 1982. She died before completing the series, which now ends with Y is for Yesterday. The final installment, Z is for Zero, was originally slated for publication in 2019. ″[A]s far as we in the family are concerned, the alphabet now ends at Y,” Grafton’s daughter Jamie Clark wrote. The author was “adamant” that her books not be adapted for the screen or ghostwritten, her daughter said, so the series is unlikely to get a neat finale. Grafton was “surrounded by family” at the time of her death, Clark wrote, noting that her mother’s health declined rapidly this week after a two-year battle with an unspecified type of cancer. The daughter of crime novelist C.W. Grafton, Sue Grafton was born in 1940 and raised in Louisville, Kentucky, which appeared in some of her work. The city’s current mayor, Greg Fischer, shared a note about Grafton’s death on social media Friday, writing, ”[I]n Louisville we have lost a citizen, friend, neighbor, a master gardener and hometown hero.” The world has lost a great talent and prolific author in Sue Grafton — and in Louisville we have lost a citizen, friend, neighbor, a master gardener and hometown hero. Her legacy will live on through her words, which will entertain and thrill readers for generations to come. pic.twitter.com/Lc4xLXnjiP The “Kinsey Millhone” series, set in the ’80s, centers around a private detective by the same name in the fictional town of Santa Teresa, California.  “Kinsey remains the series’ one constant ― by turns funny, moody, shrewd, loyal, profane, tough and vulnerable. In a word, human,” wrote one reviewer on the 20th book, T is for Trespass, in 2007. The series landed Grafton on The New York Times’ bestseller list and earned her a number of awards, including the title of Grand Master, bestowed by the Mystery Writers of America. Installments have been published in 26 languages. In a letter to readers on her website, Grafton addressed her plan after she reached the end of the alphabet with Z is for Zero, writing, “No clue.” “These novels about Ms. Millhone take incredible focus, ingenuity, energy, and imagination. If I have the wherewithal, I may write a Kinsey Millhone stand-alone or two,” she said. “If I feel I’ve lost my touch, I’ll retire with grace.” Grafton’s publisher, Penguin Random House, said in a statement on Twitter that the company was “devastated” by the loss. We're devastated by the loss of Sue Grafton. There are no words. pic.twitter.com/bwUZowW4qa"
ARTS & CULTURE,'Dick Van Dyke' Cast Member Rose Marie Dead At 94,"Actress Rose Marie, who rose to national fame in the 1960s playing wisecracking Sally Rogers on “The Dick Van Dyke Show,” died Thursday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 94. Though the actress was best known for playing Sally Rogers, her show business career goes back 90 years, starting when she was a child singer performing under the name Baby Rose Marie. Born Rose Marie Mazetta, she was known as “the child wonder.” She starred on her NBC radio show at age 5, and played opposite W.C. Fields in the 1933 film “International House,” according to Variety. It wasn’t an easy life. In her 2002 autobiography Hold The Roses, the performer described her family in harsh terms: I was raised by a mother who was a naïve, Polish lady who believed everything she was told. My father was a tyrant who had another family and never married my mother. He gambled away all the money I made as a child and my mother never knew a thing about it. He beat me because he was jealous of anybody I ever went out with. Rose Marie said mobsters like Al Capone and Bugsy Siegel helped her career as a child star. She was one of the headliners when Siegel opened the Flamingo Hotel in Las Vegas in 1946, but her comedic career didn’t really take off until she was cast on “The Dick Van Dyke Show,” considered one of the all-time great sitcoms, in 1961. Marie appeared in all five seasons and was nominated for Emmys in 1963, 1964 and 1966, according to The Hollywood Reporter. The experience was a highlight of her life, she said in a 2004 interview with The Hollywood Reporter: We were always changing lines, even right up to the very minute of going on the air. If something didn’t work, it didn’t work. Sometimes guest stars would panic because they weren’t used to this. We were a tight-knit, hard-working crew. I couldn’t wait to get to the set each day. Rose Marie was a popular TV guest star through the 1970s, and received public attention earlier this year with the release of “Wait For Your Laugh,” a documentary film about her nine decades in showbiz. Earlier this month, she wrote a piece for The Hollywood Reporter about her own experience with sexual harassment during Hollywood’s golden age. Rose Marie was married to trumpeter Bobby Guy from 1946 until his death in 1964. She is survived by her daughter, Georgiana Marie, and her son-in-law, Steven Rodrigues."
ARTS & CULTURE,The Best Comments From Milo Yiannopoulos' Editor On His Spiked Manuscript,"You may recall the literary drama that unfolded about this time last year as Simon & Schuster granted, and later revoked, a book deal for a memoir by former Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos. The book, Dangerous, was to be produced by Threshold Editions, a conservative imprint of the publishing giant, but was dropped in late February following intense criticisms by other authors and the general public. (The same month, Yiannopoulos made comments seemingly defending pedophilia, in addition to his regularly scheduled promotion of racism, sexism and other forms of intolerance.) Yiannopoulos subsequently released Dangerous independently and watched as reviewers yawned in unison. He also filed a lawsuit against the publisher that rejected him. Now we owe Simon & Schuster’s legal defense team a small debt of gratitude. Last week, they pulled back the curtain on what went down between the alt-right agitator and his would-be publisher through a series of documents filed to the New York County Clerk’s office. Among them is Yiannopoulos’ first submitted manuscript ― chock-full of criticisms by his editor, Mitchell Ivers, who serves as vice president and editorial director of Threshold. Through his own affidavit, Ivers presented among his qualifications a publishing career spanning more than 30 years and experience editing “hundreds” of books including “many” on “controversial topics.” In short, Ivers determined Yiannopoulos’ book was a mess.  He doesn’t exactly rebuke Yiannopoulos’ ideas on women, people of color, gay people, the political left and Muslims. Instead, as an editor, Ivers suggests ways to strengthen the writer’s arguments on those topics and make them palatable for a broad audience of all ages. Yet many of the hundreds of comments he made in Yiannopoulos’ first manuscript suggest the author’s thinking to be unsubstantiated, simplistic and, in Ivers’ words, “ridiculous,” “preposterous” and “phenomenally petty.” An email summarizing seven main problems with the manuscript stated that a chapter originally titled “Why Other Gay People Hate Me” needed “a better central thesis than the notion that gay people should go back in the closet.” Additionally, the feminist chapter needed a “stronger argument against feminism than saying that they are ugly and sexless and have cats.” While Yiannopoulos made passing reference to Leslie Jones, the comedian he harassed over Twitter until the platform banned him, Ivers told him a more complete explanation was necessary ― sans jokes about her looks. A chapter called “Why Ugly People Hate Me” needed to be cut entirely.  The most stinging edits, though, were contained in the first-draft manuscript itself. “This entire argument is ridiculous,” Ivers wrote alongside a section about JCPenney marketing itself “to women who think Cool Ranch Doritos are a food group.” “Unsupportable charge,” he stated next to a line about progressives “importing” minority voters. “Can you offer proof?” he asked beside Yiannopoulos’ claim that he is privately loved by “mischief-making musicians, actors and writers.” “This entire paragraph is just repeating Fake News,” Ivers noted alongside a bizarre section on witchcraft, blood, semen and Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. “This is what people say about you,” Ivers said next to a line describing feminists as “more desperate to be noticed than Kanye West at an awards show.” The list of criticisms goes on. Alongside a headline “Feminists Don’t Hate Men, But It Wouldn’t Matter If We Did” that Yiannopoulos termed as hate speech: “If that headline is hate speech, THIS WHOLE BOOK is hate speech.” Next to an argument that feminism is merely a “money-grab designed to sell t-shirts to Taylor Swift and Beyoncé fans with asinine slogans and feel-good girl power motifs”: “Um .. like your MILO SWAG?”  Beside a claim that fake news is “an invention of the mainstream media”: “No. You can’t say this. It actually exists and is used on both sides of the political spectrum.”  Some of Ivers’ most repeated complaints came back to Yiannopoulos’ insistence on writing for his base ― the editor encouraged him to define terms such as “rare Pepe” and “4chan” ― and his all-too-frequently-irreverent tone. A chapter on “Why Black Lives Matter Hates Me” was apparently one of the more readable ones, but it, too, suffered from attempted humor, the editor noted.  Ivers wrote “dumb joke” several times throughout the text. And still, the list continues: “Unclear, unfunny, delete.” “You construct this metaphor very badly.” “Let’s not call South Africa ‘white.’”  “Let’s keep ‘fecal waste’ analogies out of this chapter.” “Ego gets in the way in this paragraph. Delete.” “Doesn’t land.” “Baseless charge.” ″‘Autists’ sounds like a mental health slur.” “Superfluous joke.” “Do you have credible evidence for this?” “This rumor cannot appear in this book.” “No need to drag the lesbians into this!” “Three unfunny jokes in a row. DELETE.” “Ridiculously reductive.” “Absurd charge.” “Is this even true?” “This is definitely not the place for more of your narcissism.” “So much inappropriate humor is irritating.” “Can you really prove a causality between [Black Lives Matter] and crime rate?” “DELETE UGH.” “Too much ego.” “This paragraph doesn’t make sense.” “Stop spreading fake news.” “Are you seriously telling the reader that you advocate SMEAR CAMPAIGNS?” “Attempts at humor here are too weak and too long.” “This is not the time or place for another black-dick joke.” “Don’t make fun of school shooters ― and certainly don’t compare them to liberals.” “You MUST ACKNOWLEDGE that this is EXACTLY what people accuse you and Breitbart of being: a new age of partisan propaganda masquerading as journalism.” “I still want to know if trolling is really planning out these things in advance or just throwing stuff at the wall and seeing what sticks.” “NO MORE REFERENCES TO YOUR BOOK ADVANCE OR THE PUBLISHING PROCESS.” “This is a stupid way to end a terrible chapter. Not worth keeping in. DELETE.” Yiannopoulos submitted a revised copy of Dangerous around one month after receiving Ivers’ edits. Lawyers for Simon & Schuster noted that “among other issues,” Yiannopoulos’ text “remained riddled with what [he] labeled ‘humor’ but actually constituted the incendiary speech that [Simon & Schuster CEO Carolyn Reidy] declared that Simon & Schuster would never publish.” Reidy released a statement in late January affirming that her company would not publish material intended to “incite hatred” in response to overwhelming criticism over the publisher’s decision to work with the alt-right figure in the first place. Through a statement provided to HuffPost, Yiannopoulos said that Ivers had actually praised his work, with the editor telling him “you done good” in a text just two days before the publisher axed his book contract. HuffPost reached out to a representative for Threshold for comment on the alleged message and have not yet received a reply. In the end, Yiannopoulos gets to keep his $80,000 advance. But we get to keep this. This story has been updated with comment from Milo Yiannopoulos."
ARTS & CULTURE,Women-Only Art Shows Stood Out In 2017. Let's Leave Them There.,"Days after the 2016 presidential election, artist Roxanne Jackson impulsively posted a message on Facebook. “Hello female artists/curators! Let’s organize a NASTY WOMEN group show!!!” she wrote, invoking Donald Trump’s by then famous characterization of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. “Who’s interested???” An hour later, more than 300 women had responded, equally frustrated and appalled by the election of an accused sexual predator to the highest office in the country. They responded with such passion and excitement that Jackson and her co-organizer, curator Jessamyn Fiore, agreed they couldn’t turn anyone away from the show. Instead, the two resolved to exhibit all artworks submitted ― requiring only that the works measure under 12 inches in every direction. “The Nasty Women Art Show” opened in January, with work by 694 artists on view. The artworks were all priced under $100, with proceeds benefiting Planned Parenthood. In three days, the show sold out. It raised $42,500.  The idea quickly spread beyond New York, with sanctioned “Nasty Women” art shows popping up around the world ― in Arizona and Tennessee and Belgium and London. The next show is scheduled for January 2018 in Washington, D.C., on the anniversary of Trump’s inauguration.  The wild success of the “Nasty Women” art shows speaks to the climate of 2017, described by HuffPost’s Emma Gray as “the year women found their rage.” From the Women’s March in January, which New York magazine’s Jerry Saltz dubbed the “best art achievement of 2017,” to Time designating the “Silence Breakers” its person of the year in December, the past 360 or so days have been marked by a kind of collective outcry that’s been impossible to ignore.  But it’s inaccurate to suggest that 2017 alone prompted women to raise hell, as though they hadn’t before. It’s true that many people, particularly white women, were shocked by Trump’s election and what it suggested about our country, and leaped into action in response. Yet for others, particularly women of color, the discrimination and oppression on naked display in the Trumpian era have always been part of the American experience. And people have been protesting it for just as long. This truth was fiercely demonstrated by two sprawling exhibitions that showcased the radical art of women of color. In April, New York’s Brooklyn Museum opened “We Wanted a Revolution: Black Radical Women 1965-85,” which featured work from 40 artists, including Elizabeth Catlett, Loïs Mailou Jones, Lorraine O’Grady, Howardena Pindell and Faith Ringgold. The exhibition traced the rise of a distinctive African-American, feminist art movement in the 1960s, when artists like Emma Amos, Jae Jarrell and Barbara Jones-Hogu were among the few women represented in black artist circles. It followed the birth of all-women’s collectives like Where We At, which blended artistic practice with fundraising, community outreach, education and political action in 1971.  The exhibition was housed near one of the Brooklyn Museum’s most prized possessions, Judy Chicago’s famous 1970s installation “The Dinner Party.” Chicago’s name is central to most discussions of radical feminist art, while the names of women of color are often pushed to the margins. “We Wanted a Revolution” attempted to give those women, and their work, their due. “Liberation of Aunt Jemima: Cocktail,” for example, reflects artist Betye Saar’s mission to transfigure racist imagery into talismans of power. And “Confessions for Myself,” a 1972 sculpture by Barbara Chase-Riboud, is a towering knot of black patinated bronze with wool cascading gently down ― part metal wreckage, part feminine robe, a visual amalgamation of softness and strength. The group show highlighted how mainstream feminism in the ’60s and ’70s was a movement composed primarily of ― and made to benefit ― white, middle-class women. The art associated with such a movement, celebrated today in many museums’ permanent collections, was often incompatible with black women’s histories, anxieties and desires. To truly understand the era of activism and art, the show implicitly argued, historians have to look beyond. “What do black women feel about Women’s Lib?” Toni Morrison wrote in 1971 for The New York Times. “Distrust. It is white, therefore suspect. They look at white women and see them as the enemy ― for they know that racism is not confined to white men, and that there are more white women than men in this country, and that 53 percent of the population sustained an eloquent silence during times of greatest stress.” (It’s not clear what the “53 percent” statistic refers to, but the number is eerily familiar: It’s the same percentage of white women who voted for Donald Trump.) Five months after “We Wanted a Revolution” opened, Los Angeles’ Hammer Museum debuted “Radical Women: Latin American Art, 1960–1985,” a massive survey of work from more than 100 Latin American women artists from 15 countries. As with “We Wanted a Revolution,” most of the featured artists didn’t identify with feminism, a movement they considered “bourgeois and imperialistic.” Instead, the artists on view grappled with issues facing women ― maternity, eroticism, domesticity and gender-based violence ― through the lens of their respective countries. Cuban artist Marta María Pérez staged haunting portraits of her pregnant belly threatened by her own knife-wielding hand, a thinly veiled reference to Afro-Cuban superstitions that, along with the rest of her work, places Western myths about motherhood ― as immaculate and peaceful ― in stark relief. Also on view is Chilean artist Gloria Camiruaga’s 1984 film “Popsicles,” which shows her daughters chanting “Hail Mary” while licking ice pops with plastic soldiers in them. The piece considers the idea of childhood innocence against a backdrop of perpetual violence, the reality faced by kids growing up under Chile’s authoritarian military government. Several other all-women group exhibitions drew attention this year, including “NSFW: Female Gaze” at New York’s Museum of Sex, which focused on erotic work by younger artists, many of whom had never exhibited their work in a museum before. There was also a laundry list of overtly timely shows ― “She Inspires,” “Uprise/Angry Women,” “Secret Garden: The Female Gaze on Erotica” ― on view at New York’s Untitled Space. But critics praised both “We Wanted a Revolution” and “Radical Women” in particular, lauding them as overdue. Looking back, the shows stand out as two of the most rousing exhibitions of 2017. And they serve as interesting foils to shows like “Nasty Women,” which feature predominately young, white artists, underscoring how women of color have been making urgent, political artwork long before the Trump presidency. It’s ultimately heartening to see women-centric shows on view at wide-reaching institutions like the Hammer and the Brooklyn Museum, the latter of which dedicated an entire year to feminist programming. Given the archaic gender bias that still permeates the art world ― art by women typically sells for approximately half of what works by male artists fetch at auction ― these efforts are necessary. But they are not enough. Why? Because women artists account for fewer than a third of solo shows at major museums. And that imbalance has consequences. In a research paper published by Williams College, Paige Wilkinson found that a solo show opportunity at a major museum increases an artist’s auction sale prices, on average, from 7 to 13 percent, while a shot at a group museum show only yields a 1 to 2 percent increase. Likely, this has to do with exposure. A solo show sets one artist apart from the rest, elevating her stature in the process, while a group show lumps artists together, placing them on equal but often impersonal footing. They are grouped together because they are women, because they are black, because they are Latin American, and sometimes not much more. This kind of categorization, which can feel like siloing, exists outside the world of fine art as well. Earlier this month, musician Caroline Polachek expressed her frustration with the electronic festival Moogfest after she was placed in a lineup of female, trans and gender-nonconforming artists without her approval. “Gender is not a genre,” Polachek tweeted. “I don’t need a sympathy pedestal, esp[ecially] from a male curator. Take my name off this list and put me in the pit with the boys.” Polachek eventually dropped out of the festival altogether, because, she explained on Twitter, “I wanted to break the lane divisions and not be spotlighted for ‘historical underrepresentation.’” From the Inauguration Day march to “Nasty Women” exhibitions to a late sexual misconduct reckoning, 2017 will be remembered as the year women banded together. The momentum that erupts when women join forces, tell their stories and show their work deserves to be celebrated. But recognizing the accomplishments of women in groups runs the risk of reinforcing stereotypes that, among other things, cast women as competent collaborators who aren’t ready to stand on their own. For feminist artist collectives in the ’70s and ’80s, embracing “inherently conciliatory and cooperative” behavior provided opportunities for exposure and acclaim, turning a potential weakness into a source of strength. Yet at a certain point, we must challenge these tropes as much as we embrace them to our advantage. On top of praising “We Wanted a Revolution” and “Radical Women,” critics hailed a slew of solo shows from women artists ― including Carol Rama at the New Museum, Florine Stettheimer at the Jewish Museum and Agnes Martin at the Guggenheim ― most of whom are both white and dead. There were exceptions, including Belkis Ayón at the Fowler Museum and El Museo del Barrio and Toyin Ojih Odutola at the Whitney. But when it comes to emerging and established women artists of color, solo shows are still, disappointingly, deviations from the norm.  Looking ahead, women both within and outside the art world deserve to be recognized more as individuals, as powerful, significant and worthy in and of themselves. All-women group shows are convenient in their ability to address sweeping, historic inequalities. But artists like Pérez, O’Grady, Camiruaga and Pindell deserve the same treatment as their male contemporaries. If women-only art shows stood out in 2017, let’s leave them there. Let’s look forward to bigger and better, more radical and revolutionary work in 2018."
ARTS & CULTURE,60 Books We Can't Wait To Read In 2018,"As 2018 approaches, there’s a lot to look forward to: the end of a hellish 2017, the Winter Olympics, “The Bachelor: Winter Games,” 2017 being over, midterm elections, and 2017 finally drawing to a close.  More than anything, though, we’re eagerly anticipating the flood of new 2018 books ― and the coming year’s literary crop looks bountiful. We can’t wait to lose ourselves in new fiction from Meg Wolitzer, Laura van den Berg and Leni Zumas, and to absorb thoughtful essays about culture, gender, race and identity from Zadie Smith, Morgan Jerkins and Marilynne Robinson. We’re also excited for the books that don’t appear on this list ― books we don’t even know about yet, but which will end up surprising us with their power and beauty.  Here are the 60 books we can’t wait to read in 2018: “The Nothing,” Hanif Kureishi (Faber & Faber) An elderly filmmaker becomes obsessed with the fear that his younger wife is having an affair with a friend, and plots to expose them. Kureishi’s latest novel is a slim and focused tale of sex, vengeance and mortality. “The Immortalists,” Chloe Benjamin (Putnam) If you’re a sucker for fantasy-tinged family sagas, “The Immortalists” should have you excited. In the summer of 1968, four young siblings visit a fortune-teller who tells them the day they’ll die ― a prediction that shapes the rest of their lives. “The Afterlives,” Thomas Pierce (Riverhead) There’s a cottage industry of Christian memoirs about heaven written by people who were revived after technically dying. Pierce’s novel explores the emotional fallout of the reverse scenario: A young man suffers a sudden heart attack, is resuscitated, and realizes, to his dismay, that he didn’t glimpse an afterlife.   “Everything Here Is Beautiful,” Mira T. Lee (Pamela Dorman) Lee’s debut novel tells the story of two sisters ― the older one responsible and practical, the younger one impulsive and plagued by mental illness ― navigating a lonely adulthood after their mother dies. The narrative carries echoes of ”Sense and Sensibility,” but offers a wholly original exploration of sisterly bonds. “Red Clocks,” Leni Zumas (Little, Brown) Set in an America where embryos have been granted personhood rights and abortion has been outlawed, this chilling dystopia follows a handful of women whose lives are tightly circumscribed by these laws. Zumas’s incandescent prose promises to make ”Red Clocks” a particular treat. “Brass,” Xhenet Aliu (Random House) Aliu’s first novel arrives on a wave of glowing blurbs from some of our favorite writers of the past few years ― Celeste Ng, Cristina Henriquez, Kaitlyn Greenidge, and Laura van den Berg. In mordant, biting prose, she interweaves the stories of a mother and a daughter living in a fading Connecticut town they both hopelessly long to escape from. “The Sky Is Yours,” Chandler Klang Smith (Hogarth) Readers who love ambitious literary genre fiction should be on the lookout for Smith’s first novel, a vibrantly uncanny dystopia set on an island metropolis, in the shadow of dragons that swoop overhead, where income inequality and mass incarceration have spun out of control. “Peach,” Emma Glass (Bloomsbury USA) Even as the world confronts report after report of famous men who are sexual predators, we rarely confront the horrific pain that can result from sexual violence. In “Peach,” a stream-of-consciousness narrative about a girl reeling in the aftermath of a brutal rape, Glass confronts us with the bodily and psychological trauma left behind. “This Will Be My Undoing: Living at the Intersection of Black, Female, and Feminist in (White) America,” Morgan Jerkins (Harper Perennial) Jerkins’s buzzy essay collection revolves around identity, and what it has meant for her to live as a black woman in America. In essays about white cheerleaders, children’s books, traveling in Russia, going to therapy and much more, she unpacks her discovery of her own identity, and her struggle with the white, patriarchal American culture that surrounds her. “Heart Berries,” Terese Marie Mailhot (Counterpoint) “Heart Berries” is praised in press copy as a “poetic memoir.” But poetic is an oft-used descriptor of lovely writing, and this book seems to be something more striking than the word signifies: a memoir and a poem, a haunting and dazzlingly written narrative of Mailhot’s growing up on a reservation in the Pacific Northwest. “Asymmetry,” Lisa Halliday (Simon & Schuster) A Whiting Award winner, ”Asymmetry” tells two unexpectedly overlapping stories ― first, that of a love affair between a young woman and an aging, famous author; then the story of an Iraqi-American man who is targeted by immigration enforcement as he travels out of the country.   “The Friend,” Sigrid Nunez (Riverhead) In the acclaimed novelist’s latest book, two writers share a close, unconventional friendship; when one them dies suddenly, his widow asks the other to take in his Great Dane. As the narrator makes space in her apartment for the huge dog, she also sinks into her own overwhelming grief. “Feel Free,” Zadie Smith (Penguin Press) If you aren’t already looking forward to this new book of essays from the irreplaceable Smith, now’s the time to get jazzed. If there’s anything more absorbing to read than her novels, it might just be her essays, which are reflective, erudite yet inviting, and which always cut to the quick of her chosen subject.  “An American Marriage,” Tayari Jones (Algonquin) In Jones’s heart-wrenching new novel, a young and ambitious black couple find their lives derailed when the husband is arrested, convicted and sentenced to 12 years for a crime he didn’t commit. “An American Marriage” poses profound questions about what we owe each other, and what injustices we allow to persist. “I Am, I Am, I Am: Seventeen Brushes With Death,” Maggie O’Farrell (Knopf) A story of life, told in moments when death was nearest, is the award-winning novelist’s latest. O’Farrell’s memoir is told in highly charged vignettes ― distinct memories of near-death experiences. “The Lost Girls of Camp Forevermore,” Kim Fu (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt) Five girls on the precipice of adolescence go on a kayaking trip, but find themselves left alone in the wilderness of the Pacific Northwest. Fu’s novel starts here, at Camp Forevermore, but follows the lives of these girls well into adulthood ― and shows how deeply marked they are by that fateful time at camp. “Sadness Is a White Bird,” Moriel Rothman-Zecher (Atria) In his novel, Rothman-Zecher, once a conscientious objector who refused to serve in the Israeli Defense Forces, explores the fraught politics of the region through the eyes of a young Israeli man and two Palestinian siblings he befriends. “Freshwater,” Akwaeke Emezi (Grove) This debut novel follows Ada as she is born, grows up and leaves Nigeria for America to go to college. Always a troubled girl, it becomes clear that she has multiple personalities struggling for dominance within her, and she must grapple with external trauma as well as her own self-destructive urges. “White Houses,” Amy Bloom (Random House) In this historical novel, Bloom dramatizes the love affair between Eleanor Roosevelt and journalist Lorena Hickok. Though Roosevelt is the more familiar woman, Hickok is the narrator and central figure in Bloom’s fictionalization of their complicated romance. “What Are We Doing Here?,” Marilynne Robinson (Farrar, Straus & Giroux) The title of Robinson’s latest book of essays ― many of which were given as lectures over the past few years ― should be read with a rueful sigh. In her measured but strongly argued pieces, she takes on American self-mythologizing, the role of faith and values in our history and the roots of our divided politics.  “Census,” Jesse Ball (Ecco) Inspired by his own late brother, Ball’s atmospheric novel follows a widower who learns he’s dying and will soon leave his beloved son, who has Down syndrome, alone in the world. Desperate to make the most of their final days together, he takes a job traveling the country as a census taker. “Girls Burn Brighter,” Shobha Rao (Flatiron) The first novel from an award-winning short fiction writer, ”Girls Burn Brighter” tells the story of two young girls growing up in a small Indian village. They form a fast friendship, only to be torn apart. Rao’s novel should be a treat for Ferrante fans, exploring the bonds of friendship and how female ambition beats against the strictures of poverty and patriarchal societies. “Awayland,” Ramona Ausubel (Riverhead) Ausubel, known for her darkly whimsical fiction, is publishing her second short story collection. It will feature 11 stories, divided into four subsections: “Bay of Hungers,” “The Cape of Persistent Hope,” “The Lonesome Flats,” and “The Dream Isles.” “Rainbirds,” Clarissa Goenawan (Soho Press) Goenawan’s debut novel, a genre-bending tale of a young man who moves to a small town to put his sister’s affairs in order after she’s brutally murdered, has already garnered international praise for elegantly combining a suspenseful mystery with an eloquent meditation on love and loss.  “Gun Love,” Jennifer Clement (Hogarth) Clement turns her hypnotic pen to the story of America’s love affair with guns ― specifically, a nine-year-old girl and her mother, who live in a trailer park in central Florida. Their impoverished but happy life is disrupted by the mother’s romance with a gun-loving rascal. “The Sparsholt Affair,” Alan Hollinghurst (Knopf) The latest novel from Hollinghurst, whom New Yorker critic James Wood once described as “one of the few contemporary writers who deserve” to be praised for “writing beautifully,” is a multigenerational saga that revolves around a man named David Sparsholt who arrives at Oxford in the midst of World War II. “The Life to Come,” Michelle de Kretser (Catapult) The acclaimed Australian writer’s fifth novel spans continents ― set in Australia, France and her native Sri Lanka ― and weaves together disparate narratives that raise uncomfortable questions about Australian society, self-satisfied liberalism and modern life. “The Merry Spinster: Tales of Everyday Horror,” Mallory Ortberg (Holt) Toasties, assemble! The cofounder of the beloved, if short-lived, website The Toast has transformed one of the site’s literary humor columns, “Children’s Stories Made Horrific,” into a book of twisted tales inspired by classic fairy tales. We could not be more excited. “Men and Apparitions,” Lynne Tillman (Soft Skull) Tillman’s sixth novel ― her first in over a decade ― centers on an eccentric man with academic obsessions. She traces his mental perambulations as he immerses himself in family photographs and stories, studies modern masculinity and loses himself in his own circling thoughts and emotions. “The Gunners,” Rebecca Kauffman (Counterpoint) The Gunners are a tightknit group of neighborhood playmates ― until they come of age, and one friend stops associating with them. Years later, that long-estranged friend dies by suicide, and the remaining five gather again to untangle what went wrong, what secrets she was holding onto and what secrets are in their own pasts. “Stray City,” Chelsea Johnson (Custom House) Set in Portland in the late 1990s and the late 2000s, ”Stray City” follows a young woman who finds acceptance in the city’s lesbian community, far from her religious upbringing, only to end up having a baby after a fling with a man. Johnson’s debut promises to be an engaging, immersive saga of family, chosen and otherwise. “The Italian Teacher,” Tom Rachman (Viking) The author of ”The Imperfectionists” and ”The Rise and Fall of Great Powers” returns with a timely novel about a great artist whose failings as a father and a husband shape his family’s lives ― especially that of his son, also an artist, who lives in his father’s shadow. “The Chandelier,” Clarice Lispector, translated by Benjamin Moser and Magdalena Edwards (New Directions) Lispector, a Brazilian writer, died in 1977, but she’s enraptured a burgeoning American audience in recent years. A brilliantly artful novel of the interior life of a female sculptor, ”The Chandelier” will be released in English for the first time in March. “The Female Persuasion,” Meg Wolitzer (Riverhead) The author of “The Interestings” once again takes on the optimistic pangs of new adulthood and female ambition in a novel about a college freshman who is shocked and thrilled to be taken under the wing of a feminist leader.   “The Recovering: Intoxication and Its Aftermath,” Leslie Jamison (Little, Brown) Jamison rocketed to fame with, of all things, the publication of an essay collection, “The Empathy Exams.” Her much-anticipated new book is a hefty full-length nonfiction work, a memoir and cultural history of addiction and recovery. “See What Can Be Done,” Lorrie Moore (Knopf) Best loved for her funny, sharp short stories, Moore will release a nonfiction collection of her criticism and essays this spring.  “Macbeth,” Jo Nesbø (Hogarth) “Macbeth” might have been Shakespeare’s shortest tragedy, but there’s nothing short about Norwegian musician and crime novelist Joe Nesbø’s hefty modern adaptation. The latest in Hogarth’s Shakespeare series situates Macbeth as a beleaguered police inspector caught amid a violent drug war. “Sharp: The Women Who Made an Art of Having an Opinion,” Michelle Dean (Grove) Dean offers a new, women-centric perspective on 20th century American public thought in this history of 10 women whose writing influenced the culture profoundly, including Pauline Kael, Nora Ephron, Joan Didion, and Janet Malcolm. “And Now We Have Everything: On Motherhood Before I Was Ready” by Meaghan O’Connell (Little, Brown) Mothers and non-mothers alike have been raving about O’Connell’s book, which grew from her experience keeping an accidental pregnancy in her early 20s and navigating the rigid expectations and bewildering challenges of motherhood. “Heads of the Colored People,” Nafissa Thompson-Spires (Atria) A debut collection of interrelated stories, “Heads of the Colored People” explores the lives of black ― especially middle-class ― people, with biting, vivid prose. Thompson-Spires plumbs the depths of black trauma, but also works in a comic mode, satirizing the way Americans think and talk about race, gender, class and more. “You All Grow Up and Leave Me,” Piper Weiss (William Morrow) The true-crime memoir genre is thriving, and Weiss’ offering looks particularly intriguing: She was 14 years old when her tennis coach, Gary Wilensky, tried to kidnap a young student, failed and then took his own life. In this book, Weiss looks back on her own youthful time with Wilensky, and reexamines the case itself. “You Think It, I’ll Say It,” Curtis Sittenfeld (Random House) Sittenfeld, best known for her novels, which include ”Prep” and ”Eligible,” will publish her debut short fiction collection ― ten stories that promise to make good use of her wit and ability to draw deeply relatable characters interacting in deeply human ways. “A Lucky Man,” Jamel Brinkley (Graywolf) Brinkley’s debut collection, which explores young black men and boys coming of age and finding their places in the world, arrives loaded up with glowing blurbs from literary stars like Daniel Alarcón, Charles Baxter, Garth Greenwell, Paul Yoon and Laila Lalami. “The Pisces,” Melissa Broder (Hogarth) Broder is best known for her Twitter account and the essay collection that sprang from it, ”So Sad Today.” ”The Pisces,” her first novel, blends the fantastical with the all-too-relatable in the story of Lucy, a heartbroken, anxiety-ridden Ph.D. student who falls in love with a merman. “Not That Bad: Dispatches from Rape Culture,” edited by Roxane Gay (Harper Perennial) The only unfortunate thing about this new collection on rape culture, edited by Roxane Gay and featuring work from Gabrielle Union, Ally Sheedy, Lyz Lenz, and more, is that it’s not out until May. We’ve never needed a book like this more than we do at this cultural moment. “Motherhood,” Sheila Heti (Henry Holt) The author of the acclaimed novel-from-life “How Should a Person Be?,” Heti turns her attention away from the 20-something indulgences of friendship, casual sex, and single-minded artistry to the 30-something anxiety of whether, and when, to have kids.   “That Kind of Mother,” Rumaan Alam (Ecco) A white woman adopts a black infant after his mother, her own son’s beloved nanny, dies in childbirth. From this heartbreaking premise, Alam plumbs still more heartbreaking questions about the power and limitations of maternal love, and the implacable persistence of racial divides.  “The Ensemble,” Aja Gabel (Riverhead) A string quartet, and the four young friends that form it, pursue musical success and personal happiness in a coming-of-age novel about four people coming to grips with themselves, the lives they want and their relationships with each other. “Florida,” Lauren Groff (Riverhead) Florida is a state a lot of people have strong feelings about ― including, as it turns out, the author of ”Fates and Furies.” Her next book, a short story collection, centers on the state she calls home. “Sick: A Life of Lyme, Love, Illness, and Addiction,” Porochista Khakpour (Harper Perennial) Khakpour, a novelist and writer, suffered from a mysterious chronic illness for years before she got a diagnosis. Her memoir explores the exhausting, hope-sapping experience of navigating the health care system and searching for answers in the face of unremitting suffering. “Who Is Vera Kelly?,” Rosalie Knecht (Tin House) A classic spy novel with a modern, fully realized heroine, ”Who Is Vera Kelly?” follows the titular heroine from her turbulent youth to her time as a spy in Argentina during the Cold War. “What We Were Promised,” Lucy Tan (Little, Brown) A wealthy Chinese couple, both American-educated professionals, and their housekeeper struggle with their veiled dissatisfactions and existential crises in Tan’s debut novel. “The Third Hotel,” Laura van den Berg (Farrar, Strauss and Giroux) In this dream-like novel, a woman travels to Havana for a film festival. The trip was planned by her recently deceased husband, but when she arrives, she finds him there ― not looking very dead. The reality-defying narrative explores inescapably real questions about the human condition. “The Court Dancer,” Kyung-Sook Shin (Pegasus) The acclaimed South Korean writer’s next novel takes place in the Joseon Court and in Paris in the late 19th century, as a beautiful court dancer navigates palace intrigue, the Parisian intellectual milieu and personal heartbreak. “Eleanor, or, The Rejection of the Progress of Love,” Anna Moschovakis   (Coffee House Books) A woman loses her laptop, with all of her work inside. Her quest to recover her data shapes this complicated meta-novel, which untangles the creative process itself, in all of its contradictions, anxieties and hopes. “My Struggle: Book 6,” Karl Ove Knausgaard, translated by Don Bartlett   (Archipelago) If you’re a Knausgaard fan, mark your calendar: His next installment of the autobiographical series that vaulted him to international fame will be arrive on American shores in September. “Transcription,” Kate Atkinson (Transworld) A young woman joins the Secret Service during the war, then heads to the BBC ― but her past continues to follow her, in the latest from Atkinson, the author of ”Life After Life.” “Mr. Occam’s Razor,” Barbara Kingsolver (Harper) Kingsolver, the author of ”The Poisonwood Bible,” will publish a new novel this fall ― a cross-century saga about two families living in same New Jersey home, a one-time Utopian community, in very different eras. “Drifts,” Kate Zambreno (Harper Perennial) In an early 2017 interview, Zambreno, the author of “Green Girl,” said that her upcoming novel “deals a lot with friendships I have with other women writers, and about our conversations.” “All You Can Ever Know,” Nicole Chung (Catapult) The Catapult web editor and Toast alum has written, hauntingly, about her adoption and growing up in a white family before. Her long-awaited memoir promises to explore the subject more fully: her relationship with her adoptive family, her reconnection with her birth family, beginning her own family and how she’s worked to find a sense of belonging."

ARTS & CULTURE,"Why Do We Call That Holiday Game Yankee Swap, White Elephant And Dirty Santa?","Gift exchanges are a big part of American Christmas culture, often with a variety of creative spins on the tradition.  You might be familiar with a game in which everyone brings a wrapped gift (usually in a predetermined price range), places it in a pile and draws a number. Whoever draws No. 1 selects a present to unwrap. No. 2 can then either choose another gift to unwrap or “steal” the first person’s present. The subsequent participants can either pick an unwrapped gift or steal any previous player’s gift. Anyone whose gift is stolen can do the same.  Depending on where you grew up, you may call this gift exchange game Yankee Swap, White Elephant or Dirty Santa (shoutout to my fellow Southerners). Versions of this tradition were around as early as 1901, when mentions of “swap parties” appeared in American publications.  That year, an article from Table Talk Publishing Co. ― which published a number of cookbooks and domesticity-focused magazines ― described “the swap party” as such:  Every guest brings four or five little neatly wrapped and tied bundles. The more misleading in shape as to contents the better. The packages may contain anything from candy to soap, starch, tea, book, handkerchief, sun-bonnet, etc., the more absurd the funnier. Each person recommends their own bundles describing the contents as wittily and in a way to deceive as much as possible. The bargaining becomes very shrewd and merry until all the parcels have been swapped, oftentimes more than once. Then they are opened, the best bargain winning first prize, the poorest compelling the holder to tell a story, suggest a game, sing or recite for the entertainment of the company.  The universal verdict ― ‘no trouble and lots of fun!’ Over time, the swap party game has evolved and spread, with different names for the tradition varying by region. But why do we call it Yankee Swap or White Elephant or Dirty Santa? And do all three names refer to the exact same game?  Unsurprisingly, the term “Yankee Swap” is more popular in New England, though plenty of people in other parts of the country use it to describe this kind of gift exchange. The folks at Dunder Mifflin in Scranton, Pennsylvania, turned their Secret Santa gift exchange into Yankee Swap in an iconic episode of “The Office.” The origin of the name seems to date back to the 19th century. In the preface to his 1855 poetry collection, Leaves of Grass, Walt Whitman included “the Yankee swap” in a list of quintessentially American things. U.S. foreign trade expanded during the 19th century, and “Yankees” ― a word which could refer to Americans, New Englanders or those from the East Coast or Northeast, in different contexts ― allegedly had a reputation as constant traders looking to make a swap.  One disputed origin theory dates the name “Yankee Swap” to the Civil War, when Yankee and Confederate generals would engage in informal prisoner swaps. According to the History Channel, Union General John Dix and Confederate General Daniel H. Hill agreed to a system in 1862 in which soldiers were assigned values based on ranks. One private was worth another private, while lieutenants were worth three privates and a commanding general was worth 60 privates.  Prisoner exchanges saved soldiers from suffering in inhumane prisons like Camp Sumter in Andersonville, Georgia, where nearly 13,000 Union prisoners died of starvation, exposure and diseases like scurvy and dysentery. There isn’t strong evidence for a link between this wartime practice and the holiday game, however. If you believe the Civil War origin story, you might be of the mindset that Yankee Swap gifts are supposed to be “useful” or of higher quality than the ones in White Elephant.  According to popular legend, the term “white elephant” is related to an old practice from kings of Siam (today, Thailand). If the king was dissatisfied with one of his subjects, he would gift them a rare albino elephant. Apparently this gift was burdensome because white elephants were extremely expensive to care for and could lead to financial ruin ― giving it the label “fatal gift.” In Thai and Buddhist cultures, white elephants ― which are not snow white but rather more ruddy-colored or pinkish ― have a sacred quality. According to the legend, those who received these special gifts could not refuse them, and to make matters worse, they were not allowed to put the sacred animals to work. As such, they were both valuable and useless, hence the definition of “white elephant” as something that isn’t particularly useful and has a high cost of upkeep. This story of the white elephant as a “fatal gift” from a king appears to be more of a myth, though. In fact, in Elephants of Thailand: Myth, Art, and Reality, historian Rita Ringis wrote: “[N]o Siamese monarch ever considered white elephants ‘burdensome’ nor gave them away, for according to ancient tradition, possession of one or many of these symbolized a king’s virtue or barami.” Scholars have traced the idiom’s origin in American lexicon back to the mid-19th century, a time of renewed U.S. interest in economic relations with then-Siam (and therefore, more travel writings with exotic stories from traders).  Another theory in the White Elephant origin story is that Western Union founder and Ivy League university namesake Ezra Cornell popularized the term at 19th-century social gatherings. The legend is widespread but often cited with little confirmation as to its veracity. Yet another story involves circus impresario P.T. Barnum sparing no expense to bring a white elephant to London ― only to find audiences disappointed by the fact that the elephant wasn’t snow white but rather just a lighter color than others.  Given the origin theory and modern definition of the idiom, the game White Elephant is meant to involve a bunch of useless, burdensome joke gifts.  White Elephant appears to be the most popular name for this type of gift exchange and doesn’t have strong regional ties.  The term Dirty Santa is popular in the South. While there doesn’t seem to be much information on the exact origin of this term, presumably it has to do with the fact that the game can get a little nasty (à la Jim Halpert’s preferred name in “The Office,” Nasty Christmas). Indeed, there’s a deviation from traditional Southern manners as people can get pretty ruthless with their stealing and tend to openly show their distaste for certain gifts ― gasp!  In my experience, Dirty Santa can involve nice gifts or gag gifts, and it’s often not as strict with limiting the number of steals per round or per gift.  Different websites lay out different rules for all three title variations, so there’s room for customization. Many say that gifts may only be stolen once per round and three times per game, or suggest alternative ways of determining the order for participants.  There are also other names for this kind of gift exchange beyond those popular three, including the Grinch Game, Thieving Elves, Snatchy Christmas Rat, Cutthroat Christmas, Redneck Santa, Machiavellian Christmas and Kamikaze Gift Exchange.   Whatever you call it, remember to establish the ground rules with your group before getting started ... and try to play nice. "
ARTS & CULTURE,"Even Taylor Swift Loves Broadway's Shoshana Bean, Cynthia Erivo Covering Her Song","“My idea from the beginning was I wanted it to be like a moving Vanity Fair cover,” said Shoshana Bean, describing the video she and fellow Broadway superstar Cynthia Erivo filmed for their cover of Taylor Swift’s “I Did Something Bad.”  “I’m obsessed with Downton Abby,” the singer told Party Foul Radio with Pollo & Pearl. “So if Downton Abby made a music video, this is kind of what it would be; it would just be very still and regal.” Pairing Broadway stars and two instrumentalists, all clad in black and scarcely moving a muscle for four minutes, doesn’t exactly sound like a recipe for success. Fortunately for Bean and Erivo – not to mention listeners accounting for nearly 650,000 YouTube views to date ― it has been. “People’s reaction is beyond anything I could ever... both Cynthia and I are like, ‘What is happening?!’” confessed Bean on Podomatic’s No. 1 LGBTQ Podcast. “We thought it was cool but not this cool!” Fans of The Great White Way are likely familiar with both women. In 2005, Bean stepped into Idina Menzel’s shoes playing Elphaba in the Broadway production of Wicked, reprising the role a year later for the company’s first national tour. Erivo won “Best Actress in a Musical” at the 2016 Tony Award as Celie in The Color Purple. Backed only by Kiara Perico on viola and cellist April Guthrie, their voices meld beautifully for the smoldering take on an album track from current Swift opus Revenge. Ryan Parma’s video captivates, calling to mind the nonplussed female guitarists in the iconic music video for Robert Palmer’s ’80s hit “Addicted to Love.” Cooed Bean: “Yes, you got it!” Whether for its visuals or the powerhouse vocals – likely a combination of the two – “I Did Something Bad” has become a viral sensation. Media outlets from Billboard Magazine to Entertainment Tonight, Elle to Broadway staple Playbill have heaped praise on the rendering. Even Swift herself took notice, sharing the link to her nearly 86 million Twitter followers. Bean called the experience “crazy,” especially given the “Look What You Made Me Do” star’s recent step away from social media for the release of the new album. “My friend, in the morning, was like, ‘What if Taylor sees it?’” she shared a conversation from Dec. 1, when the video went live. “I was like, ‘She’s never going to see it.’ Then I woke up from a nap four hours later to a retweet!” Despite several friends close to the mega-star — like choreographer, fellow Broadway star and RuPaul’s Drag Race judge Todrick Hall — how Swift discovered their version is still a mystery, Bean says. The tweet, though, eased some concern. She shared: “You never know if you’re going to offend someone.” WATCH: Shoshana Bean & Cynthia Erivo Slay “I love seeing my songs covered by other people, how they reimagine and reinvent,” stated Bean,  “So I would always hope it would have the same affect on [Taylor], that she would enjoy it, respect it, be flattered. I don’t know. I just love the song.” In fact, one article cites Bean saying “I Did Something Bad” was “love at first listen.” The singer used the podcast as an opportunity to “slightly retract” the earlier statement. “Nothing of Taylor’s is ever ‘love at first listen’ for me,” confessed Bean, a guest performer last summer at TrevorLIVE New York 2017, a signature fundraising event supporting the Trevor Project’s LGBTQ-focused suicide prevention resources and crisis intervention services.  “Taylor is like an earworm,” she continued. “I always go through and am like, ‘Nah, I’m not into it!’ Then something will bring me back to it.” In this instance, Bean was in Hawaii, preparing to hit the treadmill. Knowing “if for nothing else, it’s going to give me a great beat,” she turned on Revenge. “All of a sudden,” the singer recalled, “I was like, ‘Holy shit! This is a great album!’” Her ears really perked up, Bean said, when Swift sang, “You’ve got to leave before you get left.” Before her workout finished, the track was on repeat with the genesis for her cover forming.  According to the singer, whose next solo album Spectrum is set for release February 2018, she never considered of her rendition a “huge reimagining” of the original. Though hailed as such by many, Bean simply honed in on the lyrical mention of “violins” and peeled back layers of production and “sonic elements” Swift is dabbling in on the new record. “Sometimes that can overshadow what’s just a good song on its own,” said Bean, pointing to the success of her cover as proof the track “can stand on its own with just a couple violins or just a piano or just a guitar.” That, she says, “is the magic of Taylor Swift in the first place.  “She’s a great songwriter. No one can dispute that,” she concluded, “When you strip away all the bells and whistles, that’s what’s there — and I think that’s all we really did, just strip away the bells and whistles.” Visit Shoshana Bean’s Website.

ARTS & CULTURE,"Cards Against Humanity Tackles Wealth Inequality, Sends Money To Poor","The brains behind the game Cards Against Humanity have decided to “tackle the biggest issue in the world: wealth inequality” by sending checks to 100 of their poorest customers. On its new webpage, “Cards Against Humanity Redistributes Your Wealth,” the company reveals its decision to redistribute the money it raised last month from the “Cards Against Humanity Saves America” initiative, which the company described as “a complicated holiday promotion where 150,000 people paid us $15 to save America.” “When they signed up, subscribers filled out a survey with a mix of demographic questions and red herrings. We ranked everyone based on their survey responses and geographical census data to figure out who most needed money,” the site explains. “The poorest 100 people received a check for $1,000, paid for by everyone else.”  The company included remarks from some of the initiative’s beneficiaries on its website: Kristi from Michigan said the money “would mean so much” to her, as she and her husband are taking care of her niece “for the foreseeable future because her parents aren’t capable of doing so” and “are in the process of becoming licensed foster parents.” SrCow from California said hemophilia has slowed down his work and that he’s currently trying to save $10,000 for his upcoming nuptials, honeymoon and a future home. “The $1,000 dollars will go towards our $10K goal. It will make us 10% closer to a small wedding, but a big future together,” he said. Courtney from Florida said the “$1,000 will help ensure that my bills are paid, strengthening a cushion/emergency repair account I’ve been trying to build all year.”  Cards Against Humanity says its move was driven by the harrowing statistic that “eight men own the same amount of wealth as the poorest half of humanity.” The company also said it initially wanted to launch a “campaign to eat all the rich people and live in their houses,” but its lawyers advised against that, so it “settled for something more achievable.”  The company also said its “Cards Against Humanity Saves America” initiative has enabled it to purchase “a plot of vacant land on the US/Mexico border and retain a law firm specializing in eminent domain to make it as time-consuming and expensive as possible for Trump to build his preposterous wall.” Other outcomes included cards, thank you notes from children, and a policy paper written by the Chicago Children’s Museum in partnership with DonorsChoose to “support teachers who are creating alternatives to traditional homework.” You can read all the stories Card Against Humanity shared here."
ARTS & CULTURE,New Allegation: Photographer Terry Richardson Sexually Assaulted Designer In His Studio Doorway,"Lindsay Jones never planned to speak publicly about her experiences with prolific fashion photographer Terry Richardson. The New York City-based designer and model considers herself a private person. She never wanted to harm anyone’s livelihood or hurt her own career or “cause drama” by divulging her story, she says. But some stories are too important to stay buried forever ― especially at a moment when thousands of accounts, some similar to the one Jones has kept close to her chest, are being excavated. “I have been sitting there quiet ... for a long time,” Jones told HuffPost. No more. Jones contacted HuffPost last month to talk about Richardson, famous for shooting the likes of Miley Cyrus, Beyoncé, Rihanna, Lena Dunham, Oprah Winfrey, James Franco, Kylie Jenner, Kim Kardashian, Jared Leto, Kate Moss and former President Barack Obama. During several phone conversations, Jones recalled how she met the photographer in either 2007 or 2008 for what she thought was a 10 a.m. coffee. She said she ended up leaving his studio in tears after Richardson cornered her, pulled out his penis and assaulted her. She said she chose to come forward now because she believes it could help other women ― specifically younger women entering the modeling and fashion industry today. Though Jones stressed that the culture of predatory men in fashion includes more than just Richardson, he is certainly emblematic of the problem. The photographer has faced public allegations of sexual misconduct and assault for nearly a decade, but he has denied the abuse accusations and has continued to get work from major brands and publications.  Many of his defenders, (and Richardson himself) reason that the incidents happened during the making of sexually charged art, when lines supposedly get blurred. But Jones’ story is different. In her telling, Richardson assaulted her after she’d barely gotten in the door. Through his attorney, Lisa M. Buckley, Richardson “adamantly” denied Jones’ allegations. In a letter, Buckley referred to Jones as “an opportunistic publicity seeker” and said her account of the incident is “completely inconsistent with her actions over the ensuing years.” Buckley cited emails sent by Jones in which she asked to model for Richardson, retweets from Jones’ Twitter account and two comments on an Instagram post. When presented with Buckley’s letter, Jones told HuffPost via text, “It still happened so I’m not [too] alarmed.” Of her wish to work with Richardson after the alleged assault, Jones said, “I was brainwashed into thinking it was good for my career but I feel more empowered now.” * * *   Jones said she first met Richardson outside of Balthazar, an expensive and perpetually sceney French restaurant in New York, sometime in 2007. Richardson was with a friend, sitting on a bench outside the restaurant. Jones said they began speaking after he motioned her over and asked where she was from. They talked about Utah ― Jones is from Utah, and Richardson told her he had an ex-girlfriend who grew up there ― and he expressed interest in doing a photo shoot with her. He was already a well-known photographer, and Jones, a longtime model and emerging designer, was intrigued. She gave him her number, and they started texting about scheduling over the following few weeks.  That’s when Jones began to feel nervous. She knew that Richardson did traditional fashion shoots, but she had also seen photos of his that were more risque, even what she considered “vulgar.” Richardson was ― and is ― well known for these hyper-sexualized photos, some of which feature him engaging in sex acts. Jones was wary of the style. She was married at the time to a man she describes as French and “super traditional,” and she was worried that if she was photographed in an explicit way, it would upset her husband. At the time, she had not heard any stories about Richardson being abusive toward the models he worked with. “I’m very much into art and curating and design,” said Jones. “I’m very much OK with the nude body ... even erotic artwork I like sometimes. But there was an element to this particular artwork that had a real vulgarity to it that I was uncomfortable with.” So instead of automatically agreeing to work with Richardson, Jones asked if they could meet for coffee to discuss the shoot’s mood. He said yes and told her to come to his Bowery studio (which was also his apartment) on a weekday, around 10 a.m.  As soon as she arrived at the studio, Jones said, things took a dark turn. She said she was cornered almost immediately by Richardson, who had a dog with him.  “He didn’t let me pass the doorway,” she said. “If anything, he more, like, cornered me in the doorway with his dog and told me to get on my knees immediately. No ‘How are you?’ No coffee offered. No ‘Welcome to my office. This is my bedroom. How was your day? Can I take your bag?’ ― nothing. It was only, ‘Get on your knees.’” Jones was so startled and scared ― a “deer in the headlights,” as she described it ― that she acquiesced and got on her knees. “Now that I’m older, maybe I would have ran out,” she said, engaging in a familiar kind of “what if” mental exercise. “I just didn’t feel very secure.” Once Jones was on her knees, she said, Richardson pulled out his penis and told her to “suck his dick.” She told HuffPost that he then attempted to force his penis into her eye socket. He did this with such force that Jones remembers thinking that he might have given her a black eye. “I just wanted it to be over so I could leave,” she said, later adding: “He kind of turned me into ... [in] that moment I was at his disposal, as a commodity.”  Richardson eventually masturbated to completion, said Jones, ejaculating in her mouth after ordering her to “swallow it like a good girl.” After the assault, Jones said, Richardson immediately told her to leave his apartment, directing her to pull up her low-riding pants on her way out. (She remained clothed during the assault.) Richardson never even brought up the photo shoot they were supposed to discuss.   “He was like, ‘You need to leave. I have a meeting. Pull your pants up,’” said Jones. Despite rarely crying before that, Jones remembers leaving the studio in tears, walking down to Canal Street and weeping on the sidewalk.   Over the following five weeks, Jones said, Richardson would text her sexually explicit requests, asking her again to “suck his dick.” After the fifth text, she responded “no” and deleted his number. She said she deleted the texts, too.  Jones’ experience with Richardson bears similarities to allegations made by other women against the photographer. In 2010, model Jamie Peck accused Richardson of getting naked during a photoshoot and telling her to touch his penis. In 2014, Anna del Gaizo accused the photographer of pressing his penis repeatedly into the side of her face during a photoshoot, and model Sena Cech described a “revolting and humiliating” professional experience during which, she said, Richardson’s assistant asked her “to grab his penis and twist it really hard.”  Despite the wide airing given these stories over the past several years, only in the last few months has Richardson begun to face lasting consequences. In October, both Condé Nast and Hearst cut ties with the photographer. (Richardson had reportedly already shot the January 2018 cover of Elle magazine.) Diesel dropped him, as did Valentino and Bulgari. (Other brands, including H&M, vowed to stop working with the photographer back in 2013.) But Richardson has continued to associate himself with smaller publications, such as Document Journal, Purple Magazine and CR Fashion Book (former Vogue Paris Editor-in-Chief Carine Roitfeld’s magazine) as recently as October. HuffPost contacted all three publications to ask if they planned to work with Richardson in the future and received no response.  The photographer also maintains representation through Art Partner and an ongoing relationship with Galerie Perrotin in New York and Paris. Perrotin did not respond to HuffPost’s requests for comment.  * * * In the immediate aftermath, Jones said, she kept the incident to herself and never considered reporting it to the police or her agency. After all, she still worked in the fashion industry ― an industry in which Richardson was a known, powerful entity.  This reaction is a fairly common one. According to a 2012 report put out by The Model Alliance, 86.8 percent of models reported having been asked to pose nude without advance notice, nearly 30 percent of models said they had experienced inappropriate touching on the job and 28 percent said they had been pressured to have sex with someone at work. Most of these models said they hadn’t reported these incidents to anyone ― in part because they didn’t believe their agencies would be responsive or even see an issue.  Eventually though, Jones did confide in someone: her best friend, musician and model Sibyl Buck.  Buck confirmed to HuffPost that she and Jones discussed the incident several times over the years, and she recalled their first conversation happening around 2008. “What really struck me as so repulsive is that she described how he was abusive with his dick,” Buck said. She also told HuffPost that “everybody knew” in the fashion industry the stories of Richardson’s abusive behavior ― though before Jones confided in her, Buck had only heard generalized accounts about the photographer.  Jones said she has interacted with Richardson only once since the “coffee meeting.” In September 2013, she was hired to model for the Diesel Playboy calendar, which Richardson was shooting. She grappled with whether to take the job but eventually decided to, feeling it was a smart career move. (More well-known models, such as Stella Maxwell, participated.) She also assumed there would be a large production team, which meant Richardson would probably behave. (“Around celebrities he doesn’t act the same way,” said Jones.) When she got to the shoot, Richardson introduced himself as though they had never met. At some point, they discussed Utah again, and Jones remembers Richardson talking about his father.  “I can see why people like him,” said Jones. “I’m sure he has this really great, charismatic, creative side. It’s just that he still did the other thing.” Jones has spoken about her interactions with Richardson to a handful of people besides Buck. In October 2014, she did a shoot with a prominent filmmaker who was researching the worst things that have happened to people living in New York. The filmmaker, who prefers to remain anonymous, asked Jones on camera about her worst day. She told him about that morning with Richardson, later naming her attacker off-camera. The footage was never used in a film, but it still exists. The filmmaker confirmed the date and existence of the footage, as well as Jones’ account of her experience with Richardson to HuffPost. * * * Even as allegations of sexual misconduct, harassment and assault have piled up against Richardson over the past decade, he’s continued to find work and success in his industry. Buck believes he’s remained somewhat untouchable because of his status as a boundary-pushing artist.  “Artists are traditionally allowed to be whatever weird way that makes them able to make the art that people appreciate,” said Buck. “He’s not an executive. He’s not someone that people are entrusting millions of dollars to. He’s someone that people hire to do what he does. And what he does is this creepy version of fashion.” Jones’ traumatic experience with Richardson, as well as a subsequent incident with another photographer that she declined to discuss, left her permanently cautious around male photographers. “I would warn the whole of the world: I would not enter a photographer’s studio unless there is a huge team there,” she said. “I’m a little PTSD, probably, but I never feel safe entering anyone’s apartment alone ever anymore. I carry pepper spray. I don’t like to enter apartments unless there’s a whole team with a creative director and a call sheet with very top-level production. I won’t go to someone’s house and talk to them about a shoot unless they’re a friend I’ve known for a very long time. Even if they have notoriety ― because a lot of the time, when they have notoriety it’s even worse.”  Jones stressed that, while the story she is sharing now is about Richardson, she believes the fashion industry’s problem with predatory behavior extends further. “For straight, male photographers ― and a lot of them I love to work with, a lot of them are great ― I do feel like there’s a trend,” she said. “I’ve seen a lot of it ― these kind of ‘photo guys’ in action. And, like I said, it’s a much bigger problem than just Terry. A lot of the top people, and everyone under them too.” The founder of The Model Alliance, Sara Ziff, agrees with this assessment. Ziff, who began modeling when she was 14 years old, saw firsthand the conditions that leave models “uniquely vulnerable” to sexual harassment and abuse.  In the modeling industry, the labor force skews young and female. (A 2012 Model Alliance report found that the majority of models begin their careers from ages 13 to 16.) And because models are often considered independent contractors, these young women and men aren’t afforded the same protections against sexual harassment in the workplace that full-time employees receive under federal law. It is common practice for modeling agencies to consider themselves management companies rather than employment agencies, which critics say allows these agencies to avoid being accountable for models’ safety, as well as to escape licensing requirements and sidestep commission limits. Moreover, the industry’s convoluted system ― in which clients usually book models through agencies, agencies usually cut the checks to the models, but then the models are typically not considered employees of the agencies or the clients ― means that models can simply slip through the cracks of labor laws.   Ziff is currently working with New York State Assemblywoman Nily Rozic to pass the Models Harassment Protection Act, which would formally extend workplace protections against sexual harassment to models. Ziff and The Model Alliance feel so strongly about closing the legal loopholes because they believe sexual harassment is widespread. “[Models] are working in what is often a very predatory environment,” said Ziff. “They’re working with much older male photographers. Often they’re being put on the spot to pose nude or semi-nude with absolutely no warning.” Agencies often tell models that they don’t have to do anything that they don’t want to do, that they should simply walk away or call their agent if they feel uncomfortable during a shoot. But Ziff pointed out that’s often easier said than done, especially when models are dealing with industry power brokers like Terry Richardson, who can make or break their careers. That’s why one of the first things Ziff did when she launched The Model Alliance in 2012 was to set up a grievance reporting service for models. More than five years later, Ziff said, she gets questions and complaints nearly every day.  Through their reporting service, The Model Alliance advises models and connects them with the necessary support services and legal resources. Ziff usually recommends that models pursue channels of recourse that don’t involve the press; however, she also believes that “sunlight is the best disinfectant, and as people have been raising awareness on social media and speaking out to reporters, it’s been harder and harder for the industry to ignore.”  * * * Jones knows that there will be people who will question why she waited 10 years to come forward with her story. For years she was afraid to stir up drama or cause irrevocable harm to her career. But in 2017, she’s older and more independent, no longer convinced that her livelihood requires the buy-in of powerful men.  Terry Richardson “may be more powerful than me in the industry, but he doesn’t have that power over me anymore,” Jones said. “Whatever it was in my younger, more docile, aspiring, youthful self that I thought I needed from [powerful men] or the industry or their approval that I accept[ed] this treatment as part of the way it is, I don’t believe that anymore.”   Part of what pushed Jones to come forward now is the feeling that the culture is shifting, too. Millions have shared their #MeToo stories on social media. The “Silence Breakers” are Time’s Person of the Year. After a decade of worrying that speaking up might cost her her career, Jones thinks people might be ready to listen.  “What’s happening right now is some kind of movement. There is some kind of strength in numbers,” Jones said. “Maybe it can make a ping of a difference in the world in a positive way eventually if we start to stand up for ourselves a little bit. So I guess that’s the real hope.”"
ARTS & CULTURE,Merriam-Webster Expertly Sums Up 2017 With Its Word Of The Year,"And Merriam-Webster’s word of the year is ... “Feminism.” The term enjoyed multiple lookup spikes on the dictionary’s website in 2017 and an overall 70 percent rise in its searches compared with 2016. The Women’s March on Washington and other cities around the world the day after President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January and the ongoing #MeToo movement against sexual harassment, bookended the 12 months. 2017 saw both a sustained rise in 'feminism' lookups and a number of event-driven spikes.'Feminism' is our #WordOfTheYear. https://t.co/CrEhuZe7HB Merriam-Webster defines feminism as “the theory of the political, economic, and social equality of the sexes” and “organized activity on behalf of women’s rights and interests.” “Feminism” won out over other words that could have been inspired by the Trump administration, such as “complicit,” “recuse” and “dotard.” “No one word can ever encapsulate all the news, events, or stories of a given year ― particularly a year with so much news and so many stories,” the dictionary said via a statement on its website. “But when a single word is looked up in great volume, and also stands out as one associated with several different important stories, we can learn something about ourselves through the prism of vocabulary.” The Women’s March, the release of “The Handmaid’s Tale” television series and the “Wonder Woman” movie and the #MeToo movement all contributed to the term's popularity, the dictionary added. “The word feminism was being used in a kind of general way,” the dictionary’s editor-at-large, Peter Sokolowski, told The Associated Press. “What does it mean to be a feminist in 2017? Those kinds of questions are the kinds of things, I think, that send people to the dictionary.” 2. Complicit ― an accusation leveled at first daughter Ivanka Trump. 3. Recuse ― what Attorney General Jeff Sessions did from the Russia probe. 4. Empathy ― Trump was regularly criticized for having none. 5. Dotard ― North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un’s nickname for Trump. 6. Syzygy ― searches soared thanks to the full solar eclipse in August. 7. Gyro ― inspired by a Jimmy Fallon skit on “The Tonight Show.” 8. Federalism ― the congressional debate over the Affordable Care Act caused this to surge. 9. Hurricane ― Harvey, Irma, Jose, and Maria all struck in 2017. 10. Gaffe ― The Best Picture announcement blunder at the Academy Awards made this a highly searched term."
ARTS & CULTURE,Spike Lee's 'She's Gotta Have It' Show Is Black Art That's Free To Be Mediocre,"“She’s Gotta Have It” made me angry ― a reaction I hadn’t expected, but was ultimately thrilled with.  In 1986, when Spike Lee made his film debut with “She’s Gotta Have It,” the concept of a black woman dating three men at the same time was an edgy one. The novelty of the conceit, empowering though it may be, has worn off in the 2017 Netflix reboot of the film.  There’s a tendency to praise black art for the sake of being black. Most black people can identify with Issa Rae famously declaring, “I’m rooting for everybody black.” Authentic representations of black people created by black people have had to be exceptional to receive even the slightest praise in the film and television industries. Sometimes, any form of representation feels like a win, and criticism of that representation feels like a betrayal. But maybe now’s a good time to sit with, consider and process how we praise and how we criticize black art. Because for all its glorious blackness, and for all its good intentions, “She’s Gotta Have It” is not necessarily a good show. And that’s OK.  In this update, set in the Fort Greene neighborhood of Brooklyn, Nola Darling is a black millennial with a capital B, and the series will remind you of that every chance it gets.  “I’m a sex-positive, polyamorous pansexual,” Nola tells us from her iconic Loving Bed, the only place she has sex with her rotation of partners. “I consider myself abnormal. But who wants to be like anybody else?” This is a show about black female sexuality, but only nominally. It actually has little to say about black female sexuality, and hardly anything to say about queerness. Nola is not so much a sex-positive, polyamorous, pansexual, black feminist 20-something artist living in Brooklyn as she is the idea of one. In this sense, “She’s Gotta Have It” is an intense exercise in suspension of disbelief. We need to believe, for instance, that Nola Darling would actually enjoy the company of any of the wack dudes she’s dating (with the exception, perhaps, of Mars Blackmon). And we need to believe that Nola’s art, while perfectly fine, is as incendiary and groundbreaking as it’s presented in the world of the show. (The best of her work comes in the form of a #MyNameIsnt street campaign based on Tatyana Fazlalizadeh’s 2012 “Stop Telling Women To Smile.”)  Nola ― and, indeed, everyone around her ― talks in hashtags, dresses like an Afropunk attendee, and makes constant pop culture and film references that are supposed to seem worldly and cultured but just read as random and superfluous. (At two different points in the show, she chastises her lovers for having never heard of the hardly obscure movies “Terms of Endearment” and “Dirty Pretty Things.”) But Nola, played by the effervescent and stunning DeWanda Wise, has a lot of heart and a lot of genuine goodness, which makes up for her characterization in a show that sometimes feels as though it’s coming from a world and a time that young, independent black women aren’t actually living in. Nola declares herself to be proudly sex-positive, polyamorous and queer, and yet the lack of transparency between herself and her lovers throughout the series suggests that not only Nola, but the show’s creators, aren’t quite sure what to make of these concepts. Each episode is, for better or worse, dominated by Lee’s very distinctly old-school point of view. (He wrote several episodes and directed the entire series.) Perhaps that’s why the show feels out of step. Or perhaps it’s the fact that many of the writers on the series, including Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Lynn Nottage, are older, with backgrounds steeped more heavily in theater than in television.  Whatever the reason, the result is a show that wants so badly to be au courant and relatable but that, with its monologues and problem-of-the-week episode structure, feels anything but.  In episode two, ”#Bootyful,” Nola’s friend Shemekka grapples with the decision to get butt injections. Despite the show’s pretense of being all about empowering black women, the narrative ultimately humiliates and shames Shemekka ― who decides to go through with the procedure and turns out an amazing performance at the burlesque club where she works, only to end up in the hospital when her ass shots grotesquely pop open. She’s bedridden for most of the rest of the series. This is the type of ankh-and-ashy moralism that taints the otherwise great parts of the show.  Nola is an archetype, a beautiful enigma, rather than a person. The problem here is that the entire series is about Nola pushing back against labels, against other people’s definitions of who she is, against ownership and expectations. In the show’s finale, a Thanksgiving episode, Nola invites her three lovers to dinner and has a breakthrough: She is actually the man of her dreams. But Nola is too flat a character for the epiphany to feel at all earned. It’s just the show assigning her another arbitrary label.  “She’s Gotta Have It” has moments of genuine brilliance: Anthony Ramos’ weird, hilarious performance as one of Nola’s lovers; the excellent soundtrack of entirely of black music; the commentary on gentrification in Fort Greene, police brutality and Donald Trump; DeWanda Wise’s everything.   But the show’s flaws are numerous, and it has rightly been called out for them ― for its limited representation of queer black female sexuality, for its unconscious misogyny, for its shallow radicalism.  These critiques are the most valuable thing about “She’s Gotta Have It.” The imperfect show, at times infuriating in its tone and point of view, marks an important point in the conversation about diversity and representation: It is a lackluster work of black art that is free to be lackluster, that doesn’t have to bear the full weight of the culture from which it has emerged. It need not represent anything but its own ambitions.  There is room for mediocre black art. There is room for black art that not all black people have to love. There is room for black art that falls short of its potential. Nola is a prime example of this: Her beautiful, realistic portraits of black woman are just OK until she pushes herself to move past archetypal representations and toward something more personal and difficult.  Some black art will poignantly capture us in a way that truly resonates; some black art may totally miss the mark; some works, like “She’s Gotta Have It,” will be a frustrating mixture of the two. This is an important thing to acknowledge, especially in the case of a creator and a cultural leader like Lee, who for years has enjoyed a kind of critical immunity among black audiences.  There’s no denying the importance of Lee’s past works, from “Do the Right Thing” to “School Daze” to “Malcolm X.” He made films for the culture and about the culture that entered the zeitgeist without ever pandering to white audiences.  Lee has also made less-than-stellar movies. But his presence and prominence in the mainstream was such a hard-won victory, both for himself and for black folks, and his worst critics so often confirmed the urgency and necessity of his work, that he seemed to get a pass from the people best equipped to engage with his movies. As his filmography grew, his weaknesses as a storyteller became more pronounced — the outdated racial and gender politics of “Chi-Raq,” the erratic overstylization of “Red Hook Summer” — and his work seemed to lose touch with what had made him vital in the first place. “She’s Gotta Have It,” after all, is as much a piece of deep nostalgia for a time when Lee’s voice was fresh and singular as it is an exploration of black female sexuality and autonomy. Season 1 of the show ends with Nola finally establishing control of her relationships with her lovers and sending them on their way, thankfully avoiding the original film’s jarring rape. It shows growth, but so much of this show otherwise feels awkwardly tethered to the past. What has changed since the original “She’s Gotta Have It” is that Lee is now one of a number of great black filmmakers. He is not the great black filmmaker, and neither his work nor his stature is too fragile to withstand critique and debate.  This is how art, how representation, how conversations about the ways we reflect back to ourselves get stronger, better, more authentic. No, “She’s Gotta Have It” isn’t great. But it’s great that it exists. "
ARTS & CULTURE,The World War II-Era Women Who Broke Up The Disney Boys' Club,"When Mary Fleener was 8 years old, she was snooping around her family’s basement when she stumbled on a trove of unfinished drawings. They depicted, in undone but strangely fluent lines, iconic Disney characters — Mickey Mouse, Bambi and Goofy, among others. When Mary asked her mother, Virginia, where they came from, Virginia explained that she made them, years ago, while working for Walt Disney. Mary was floored. She knew her mother only as a stay-at-home mom. “I was like, what?” she recalled in an interview with HuffPost. “You were a cool person who worked for Disney?” The discovery of the trashed Disney drawings astounded Mary, now a successful comic artist in her 60s, for two reasons. First, there was the shocking realization that her mother had a secret career as a professional animator. Just as confounding, however, was the subsequent revelation that every single frame of every single animated movie she loved was made by a human hand. “It hit me that this stuff was drawn by people,” she said. By people, yes. And often, in some way or another, by women. According to Walt Disney himself, women were ideal candidates for his company’s early ink and paint department, responsible for bringing dimension, depth, detail and color to early 20th-century animators’ drawings. Mindy Johnson writes as much in her book Ink & Paint: The Women of Walt Disney’s Animation. Sure, it was the animators, predominantly men, who were responsible for drafting Disney characters’ initial forms and movements ― and as the originators, they were viewed as the “most-skilled artists,” Johnson notes. But it was the inkers and painters who stepped in after the animators’ job was done, to refine and enhance their designs. The jobs required immense composure and precision, traits frequently associated with femininity at the time. As a press release from Walt Disney Studios in the 1920s explained, “Girls not only have more patience and a finer sense for detail, line, and color — they have infinitely more patience to do a more finished type of work so necessary for this work on celluloids.” In the 1920s and throughout the 1930s, the ink and paint department was the only creative department in the Disney Studios open to women. Even more disheartening, the department recruited only those under the age of 35. One call for artists from the time, discovered by Johnson, reads: “Women over thirty-five have shown that their muscles start to stiffen and that they cannot master a pen and brush technique so well as younger girls.” Around 1934, however, Disney began to make more of a concerted effort to incorporate women into the workplace. Beyond working as secretaries and stenographers, a few also climbed the ranks of the company’s creative fields. Bianca Majolie started at Disney that year, eventually becoming the first woman to work as a storyboard artist, the lone woman in a room with 15 men. While the men prided themselves on slapstick humor and silly gags, Majolie incorporated emotion into her story arcs, which would become a staple of Disney’s animation formula. She eventually created story outlines for classics like “Cinderella” and “Peter Pan.” Hazel Sewell, Walt Disney’s sister-in-law, also made waves as an art director in the 1920s, working on films like “Snow White” and “Bambi.”  Yet the majority of women still worked in ink and paint, where they were separated out from the rest of their colleagues in a self-contained wing of Disney’s Burbank offices. Johnson believes the gender segregation stemmed, in part, from an effort to keep women ― new to the workplace environment dominated by men ― relatively comfortable. But the quarantine was also a safety precaution. The ink and paint department worked with nitrate cellulose, a highly flammable material, so it was necessary for the department’s employees to operate in a contained workspace. If a cigarette-smoking animator were to drop by, for example, he could set the department alight.   “Even the slightest speck of dust, on screen, looked like a boulder,” Johnson told HuffPost. “You couldn’t have people traipsing though; it had to be a controlled and contained environment.  “This was not Betty Crocker’s kitchen,” she added. “This was Madame Curie’s lab.” Since she was a young child, Virginia Fleener dreamed of being a costume designer, of translating her love of drawing into some kind of career. “My mother was a seamstress,” the 95-year-old told HuffPost. “I grew up loving the feel of materials.” But Fleener’s aspirations changed course when she entered college, fell in love and got married. “I decided I wanted to have some children and be a housewife, a homemaker,” she said. Then in 1941, less than a year after her wedding, Fleener’s husband was drafted by the Navy to fight in World War II. Like many women at the time, Fleener suddenly found herself in need of a job. Meanwhile, the war had thrown Disney’s cartooning department into chaos. Some employees enlisted, others were drafted, and those who remained were relegated to making war-related training videos. Almost overnight, Johnson said, the campus came to resemble a military base. Employees had to wear ID badges, as well as sign in and sign out every day. “You didn’t know what you were working on because, in order to keep the studio going, they were making a lot of military training films, a lot of which were top secret,” Johnson said.  As for the ink and paint department, it was down to almost half its size in ’41 compared to the year prior. So the Disney Studios began distributing messages to local art schools throughout Los Angeles and placing ads in local papers. One read: “Do you want a career in art? Walt Disney needs young women who have had training in pen and ink work, now! A real opportunity for the girl who excels.” Virginia Fleener saw one such ad, applied and ― at 20 years old ― got the gig. “It was a very nice place to work at the time,” Fleener recalled. “One time I got on the elevator, and there was Walt Disney!” She began in the ink and paint department in 1942, but just a few weeks later, Fleener was transferred to the animation department, the section of Disney off limits to women a decade before. “The Studio will lose quite a few of its men to the armed forces,” detailed a 1942 memo from the Walt Disney Studios archives. “Should many more be called, it is not impossible that girls will be trained for jobs now held only by men.” Soon women were working in the camera and editorial departments, and because Disney was unionized, the women were able to vie for fair compensation. “They put down their brushes and picked up pencils,” Johnson said. After the war, however, many men returned to their previous Disney posts, pushing women back into inking and painting. Their pay, if increased in the war-time era, was docked as well, Johnson said. Fleener doesn’t remember feeling discriminated against at her workplace. When asked if she ever faced sexism or any sort of gender-based harassment, she responded, “We didn’t think that way then. We heard about things going on in Hollywood. There was always gossip, but we didn’t know whether it was true.” Fleener was one of the first women to break into the boys’ club of animation, and many more followed suit. Jane Baer started working at Disney in 1954 as an animator for “Sleeping Beauty.” At 20 years old, Baer was one of 10 women brought on for the film, all of whom worked together in a big room Baer referred to as the “bullpen.” She is the only one still alive today. “They thought hiring girls was a good idea because we had the right delicate touch to do the fine lines on princess Aurora,” Baer told HuffPost. Baer, now 83, grew up in Winnipeg, Canada, where she lived what she called a “regular life.” Her parents had saved enough money to send one of their children to college ― Baer’s brother. “Why waste it on a girl?” Baer said. “In their minds, I would just get married and have babies and that would be that.” Although her father had encouraged her to take art classes growing up, he never considered the possibility that his daughter could see drawing as anything more than a hobby. “We were expected to be stenographers and secretaries ― to get married and have babies,” Baer said. “My mother never worked after she got married, never drove a car. It was just different.” Yet Baer, who described herself as “very stubborn,” was undeterred. Set on becoming an artist like her dad, Baer decided the first step on her path to a career was attending the ArtCenter College of Design in California. “If I was told I couldn’t do something, I would try to do it,” she said. “My father wouldn’t finance my ArtCenter venture, but I was going to do it one way or another.” Baer was accepted to ArtCenter and paid tuition herself with money she earned working as a graphic designer at the time. She bunked with an older Texan woman who had recently gone through her fifth divorce, and Baer earned her keep by cooking and cleaning. Shortly after she graduated, luckily enough, Disney was hiring. The women working on “Sleeping Beauty” became fast friends, in part, Baer said, because the competitive atmosphere common in male-dominated workspaces was absent. Like Baer, many of the women she worked with were raised to be secretaries, wives and mothers. “We didn’t have any aspirations to do anything more than what we were doing,” she said. “We weren’t discouraged but we also weren’t encouraged to become top animators. We were content, to a degree, doing what we did.” Although gender stereotypes potentially capped Baer’s ambition, she said her experiences with men in the workplace were overall positive. “The [men] would come by after lunch and tease [the women] and keep us from working,” she said. “We got blamed for encouraging it. But there was no sexual stuff that I was aware of. There were no Harvey Weinsteins, at least to my knowledge. The old men treated us very nicely.” Baer worked on Disney films including “The Black Cauldron” and “The Prince and the Pauper.” In 1984, she opened her own animation studio, Baer Animation, with her husband at the time, Dale Baer. She later worked on the iconic “Who Filmed Roger Rabbit,” creating the dizzying Toon Town sequence. But it was Baer’s first film, “Sleeping Beauty,” that inspired a young Gretchen Albright when she was a kid. The classic fairy tale was Albright’s favorite movie. “I’d pretend I was getting the characters ready for their performance with these stickers my mom got me,” she recalled. Albright, now 67, was drawn to the film industry from a young age, in part because her father worked as a grip for 50 years. She never imagined herself pursuing animation, but in 1972, after she’d graduated from UCLA with a French degree, she saw Disney was hiring in their Xerox department. She applied and got the job. “It’s not like the Xerox machine that most people are familiar with,” Albright warned. “It is a three-room process.” Before long, Albright was transferred to the ink and paint department as a painter. To her, the job felt like the grown-up extension of a ritual she cherished so much as a child, dressing up “Sleeping Beauty” stickers in pretty outfits. “In painting you were doing just that,” she said, “putting colors onto the characters so they could perform in their final stages. It was just amazing, I thought, ‘I cannot believe I get paid to do this.’” Because of her grueling work hours, Albright said, she and the other women in ink and paint “bonded like sisters.” Together, they worked on Disney classics including “The Little Mermaid” and, her personal favorite, “The Lion King.” Albright’s tenure was long enough that she spent time in every part of ink and paint, eventually running the entire division, and proceeded to help usher Disney animators into the digital age. In all her time at Disney, she said, she recalled only one minor incident with a male colleague. “A male co-worker was carrying this massive phone-looking thing past the paint lab and I made some remark about it being quite large. He said something like, ‘Want to try it out?’ I thought, ‘Oh, that’s not quite the right thing to say.’ But he probably thought he was being funny. It never happened again.” The Disney offices Albright remembers were still somewhat segregated by gender at the time. When she started there she noticed “there was a club-type thing on the third floor of the animation building that was pretty much men only.” Albright didn’t think too much about it, especially given that her realm of the office was all women. “I was more interested in what we were doing than who we were doing it with,” she added. Virginia Fleener didn’t recall experiencing any off-color remarks from men at work, but her daughter Mary remembered one strange incident involving, appropriately enough for the animation world, a drawing. Mary said that one day when she was about 21, her mother ducked out of work to go to a dentist appointment. When Virginia returned, there was a drawing on her desk of a woman in a dentist chair with a man peering so deeply into her throat he was inside her. The caption read: “This might hurt a little.” “There was flirtation back then. It wasn’t all squeaky clean,” Mary said of her mother’s era. “She has a lot of caricatures men drew of her. A lot of these guys were probably up to no good like they are today. Even though they were drawing Bambi, they were dirty old men.” Baer, Fleener and Albright all attested that their workplaces were, overall, safe spaces for women to cultivate their skills, different from the toxic and misogynist environments described in recent news stories. Earlier this month, Disney Animation head John Lasseter announced that he was taking a leave of absence from Pixar, following accusations of behavior that left his co-workers feeling “disrespected or uncomfortable.” It is possible predatory bosses were not as prevalent in the ’40s, ’50s, ’60s and ’70s as they appear to be today, but it seems likely the behavior we now recognize as problematic was perceived as normal in mid-century workplaces. Included in Johnson’s book is an excerpt from a 1919 secretarial guidebook detailing how women should react if their male superiors acted inappropriately. Although it wasn’t culled from the Disney vault, it speaks to the behaviors expected of women at the time. “She must learn not to see that his glance is too fervid, not to feel that hand that rests on hers.” If a woman was to respond, she should do so with “tact and politeness, for it is not the rebuff that counts so much as the way in which it is done.” Looking back, Baer concluded that Disney was more patriarchal an atmosphere than she realized at the time. But she’s confident that, with time, the climate has changed. “There is still a boys’ club going on, but the door is getting pushed open now, thank God,” she said. “The mindset is opening up and fresh. It isn’t closed to women like it was. Even though it was never spoken about, it was there. You just knew not to push it too much or you’d be classified as a pushy broad. Not today. It’s very encouraging.” Today, Jane Baer is 83, Gretchen Albright is 67 and Virginia Fleener is 95. Many of their co-workers are no longer living, but the three women look with warmth, if not utter amazement, at the next generation of comic artists, especially the women, who have the high expectations and big dreams they didn’t. “In today’s world, women can do anything,” Baer said. “I went to an animation convention over the weekend and was amazed by the number of young women there with incredible talent interested in all facets of animation. I was blown away. The door is pretty much wide open.” Today’s young women animators surely benefited from women like Baer, Albright and Fleener, who proved that women have far more to offer the world of animation than a “delicate touch.” Women are now represented in almost every aspect of production, though still in lackluster percentages. In 2015, women made up 10 percent of animation directors and producers, 17 percent of writers, 21 percent of art/designers and 23 percent of animators, according to the Animation Guild. Organizations like Women in Animation are devoted to tipping the scales further; it is currently working toward equal employment for men and women on animation productions by the year 2025. Mary Fleener, in particular, attributes much of her success to the fact that she grew up with a “mother who did art when she wanted, the way she wanted. I inherited her art genes and I would use her art supplies.” Mary’s work is a far cry from Virginia’s. Instead of smiley princesses and anthropomorphized woodland creatures, Mary draws bawdy, underground, feminist comics including her semi-autobiographical series “Slutburger Stories.” The name riffs off a derogatory term for a promiscuous woman. The cover of the first edition of “Slutburger” features a woman in a cubist style, as if made by Picasso’s feminist cousin with a soft spot for hallucinogens. The surreal babe sits in an oversized martini glass, her green, pink, purple and yellow legs fanning out beneath her in multicolored high heels. Her face is a jigsaw puzzle; her many arms cast her as a party girl Kali ― she uses some to pose, others to caress herself, giving shape to the constant multitasking intrinsic to the feminine experience. There is a magic to Disney’s “Sleeping Beauty,” which tells of beautiful princess Aurora who is cursed by the evil fairy Maleficent to remain in a deep sleep until true love’s kiss awakens her. Yet the classic film, based off the story by Charles Perrault, doesn’t do much for gender representation in 2017. After all, Princess Aurora spends most of the story unconscious. But without an animated character like Aurora, who Disney bosses thought required a woman’s hand to render, there may never have been a Slutburger, bursting out of a martini glass with her nipples exposed. Aurora might live happily ever after, but Slutburger gets to live on her own terms."
ARTS & CULTURE,NYC Met Museum Refuses To Remove Painting That Petition Says 'Sexualizes' Girl,"The Metropolitan Museum of Art will not remove a painting that an online petition claims “sexualizes” the image of a girl, said a museum official. Apparently inspired in part by the atmosphere of complaints about sexual harassment, New York City entrepreneur Mia Merrill launched the petition calling for the museum to remove the work, “Thérèse Dreaming,” because it presents the girl in a “sexually suggestive pose.” The 1938 painting by French artist Balthus shows a girl of 12 or 13 sitting in what seems to be a bedroom with her eyed closed and hands on her head. One of her legs is bent at the knee, with her foot resting on the chair. Her skirt has fallen open and her underwear is exposed. “‘Thérèse Dreaming’ is an evocative portrait of a prepubescent girl relaxing on a chair with her legs up and underwear exposed,” Mia Merrill wrote on the petition posted on the Care2 website on Thursday. “It is disturbing that the Met would proudly display such an image.” Given the “current climate around sexual assault and allegations that become more public each day, in showcasing this work for the masses, the Met is romanticizing voyeurism and the objectification of children,” Merrill added. The petition had more than 8,000 signatures Monday night. I put together a petition asking the Met to take down a piece of art that is undeniably romanticizing the sexualization of a child. If you are a part of the #metoo movement or ever think about the implications of art on life, please support this effort. https://t.co/gcCAFDe749 Museum spokesman Kenneth Weine said the Met would not remove the work and told the New York Post that “moments such as this provide an opportunity for conversation.” He added that the Met’s “mission is to collect, study, conserve, and present significant works of art across all times and cultures in order to connect people to creativity, knowledge and ideas.” The National Coalition Against Censorship issued a statement Monday supporting the museum’s decision. “Recent cases of censorship, including the threats of violence that forced the Guggenheim Museum in New York to remove several exhibits, reveal a disturbing trend of attempts to stifle art that engages difficult subjects,” said the NCAC statement. ” Art can often offer insights into difficult realities and, as such, merits vigorous defense.” Over 7500 New Yorkers have petitioned the #Met to remove this painting. The reason given was the “current climate around sexual assault.” The society has gone insane.This is one of the most stupid things I’ve heard in my life. A huge fan of his art. #Balthus #Art #NewYork pic.twitter.com/BOHg9Iu7tT Merrill said in the petition that Balthus had a “noted infatuation with pubescent girls” and called his work “pedophilic.” The painting features Thérèse Blanchard, a Paris neighbor of Balthus.  In an update to her petition Monday, Merrill said she would also consider her petition a success if the Met included a message with the painting “as brief as: “Some viewers find this piece offensive or disturbing, given Balthus’ artistic infatuation with young girls.”  It’s not the first time viewers have been disturbed by Balthus’ paintings. A review in The Guardian of an exhibit of Balthus’ works in 2013 at the Met, which included “Thérèse Dreaming,” noted the artist had an “inordinate fixation on girls who’d just hit puberty” and that the paintings had an “unsettling undertone” because of the “erotic images of children.” A sign at the start of the exhibit at the Met that year warned that “some of the paintings in this exhibition may be disturbing to some visitors.”"
ARTS & CULTURE,This New York Activist Wants To Replace A Statue Of Columbus With Toussaint L’Ouverture,"In 2013, when Glenn Cantave was an undergrad student studying abroad in Bolivia, he did as many tourists do in the country and visited the colossal statue of Cristo de la Concordia, one of the largest depictions of Jesus in the world. For many Bolivians, the statue is a site of national pride. The 133-foot figure towers over visitors clamoring to take his photo, his arms outstretched as if offering a giant hug. But for Cantave, something about it felt wrong. “I have nothing bad to say about Jesus as a guy,” he told HuffPost. “But Bolivia has one of the largest indigenous cultures in South America and the religion of Christianity was imposed on its people. This image of a white man looking down on everyone was very problematic.”  The experience shifted Cantave’s perspective on the relationship between men perched on pedestals and the communities obliged to literally look up to them every day. But the monument that angers him most, however, is the one at home: a 76-foot statue of Christopher Columbus, a man who Cantave unequivocally calls a terrorist, in Manhattan.  “A terrorist is someone who intimidates people for a political cause,” Cantave said. “For him, that cause was the expansion of the Spanish Empire for profit. Columbus threatened and raped and murdered. It is ass backwards that a city like New York, with such a high awareness of terrorism, has a terrorist as a landmark.” I met Cantave at Queens Borough Hall, at the first of five public hearings addressing what should become of New York City’s contentious monuments. Cantave attended and testified at four of the hearings.  Concern over what should become of the controversial monuments ― which Mayor Bill de Blasio referred to as “symbols of hate” ― bubbled over in August when a white supremacist rally protesting the removal of a Confederate statue in Charlottesville, Virginia, turned violent, resulting in the murder of counterprotester and anti-racist activist Heather Heyer. Shortly thereafter, protests erupted in New York demanding the removal of a statue of Dr. J. Marion Sims. Though he is known as the “father of gynecology,” he has a legacy of torturing enslaved women, performing “experimental surgeries” on them without anesthesia. In early September, de Blasio announced that he was forming a committee, called the Mayoral Advisory Commission on City Art, Monuments and Markers, to advise him on what should become of the various controversial monuments strewn throughout the five boroughs. The commission ― co-chaired by Darren Walker, the president of the Ford Foundation, and Tom Finkelpearl, commissioner of NYC’s department of cultural affairs ― includes artists, architects, professors, activists and scholars of a cross-section of ages, races and genders. Together, they invited interested citizens of various neighborhoods to take the floor of public hearings and share their opinions on the fates of monuments in question, such as statues of Christopher Columbus, Theodore Roosevelt and J. Marion Sims. In Queens, Cantave addressed a moderate crowd, many of whom were protective of the Columbus statue. Panelists spoke of its historical significance and value to some Italian immigrants. “What this says to me is that my life as a black man does not matter,” Cantave told the room. “My last name is Cantave, it’s a slave owner’s last name. I don’t know my real last name because of Columbus.” Cantave is the founder and CEO of Movers and Shakers, an activist coalition that uses innovative techniques like virtual and augmented reality to advocate for marginalized and oppressed populations. The organization is currently advocating for the removal of the statues that honor these men. Over 120 artists and scholars from around the country published an open letter on Friday with similar demands, requesting the removal of Columbus, Roosevelt and Sims monuments along with statues of Vichy France’s Nazi collaborators Philippe Pétain and Pierre Laval.  The letter reads in part:  “By far the most controversial of the monuments is that to Christopher Columbus, who served the Spanish crown, and spoke and wrote only in Catalan. Because he was born in Genoa in 1451 – a city that did not become “Italy” until the unification of the country in 1861 – he was adopted as a patriotic symbol by Italian immigrants in the nineteenth century. But the public claim of “ownership” of Columbus by Italian-Americans cannot be allowed to override his key role in the historical genocide of Indigenous peoples of the Americas. By 1600, at least 50 million Indigenous people died in this hemisphere as a result of the Columbian encounter with Europeans, whether from war, disease or enslavement. It takes only a little understanding to see why their descendants do not regard anything associated with 1492 as an object of veneration.” Cantave doesn’t just want to remove the monument to Columbus, though. Instead, he suggests replacing the statue with a tribute to Toussaint L’Ouverture, who led the Haitian Revolution in the 18th century. New York has the second highest Haitian population of any U.S. state. Yet L’Ouverture’s significance, Cantave believes, extends beyond the scope of the Haitian diaspora.  “In general, monuments reflect financial glory,” he said. “Oppressed peoples don’t have role models to look up to. L’Ouverture’s efforts resulted in the establishment of the first, free black republic. If you had him glorified as a statue and his name in the textbooks, that would change everything.” Cantave believes that manifestations of white supremacy today ― in alt-right chatrooms and at pro-Donald Trump rallies ― stem from the same colonizing mindset Columbus brought to America. “Why is the erasure of black and brown history a recurring theme?” he asked. Earlier this month, he demonstrated the parallels by staging the “Slave Auction 2017” performance in Herald Square, forcing New Yorkers to confront the consequences of Columbus’ historical exploits head on. Protesters formed a procession in the middle of Manhattan, some wearing shackles and others prison uniforms and handcuffs.  “Columbus entered the Americas with the intent of enslaving its inhabitants for the economic benefit of the Spanish crown,” the project description explains. Genocide expert David Stannard estimates that Columbus and Europeans under his leadership killed between 70 million and 100 million indigenous people beginning in 1492. Between 1500 and 1866, approximately 12.5 million people were kidnapped from Africa and enslaved in America. “It was only after his men realized that their slaves were not resistant to European diseases did they decide to use forced labor from West Africa,” Cantave said.  Cantave will continue mounting protests against Columbus’ monument until a decision has been made regarding its future. He’s also working on a Columbus picture book, White Supremacy 101: Columbus the Hero?, that uses augmented reality to amend the falsehoods embedded in the whitewashed history that is often recounted in schools. Working with a team of illustrators, animators, poets, rappers and historians, Cantave transformed black-and-white drawings into animated narratives that come alive with the help of an iPhone. Each page of the book features a five- to seven-second animation loop generated from academically verified accounts of Columbus’ actions.  His live action protests, including a public presentation of “Slave Auction 2017” and an upcoming event on Dec. 3 in Times Square, involve animated excerpts from his upcoming augmented reality book, blown up as 24-by-36-inch prints.  With the book, Cantave hopes to appeal to a scope of readers beyond historians and academics. “A lot of people do not care about Christoper Columbus,” he said. “He’s engrained in our society, but people don’t know what he did. There are people out there who have done the work and told the truth, but if you’re not an academic or a university student, chances are you’re never going to pick up one of their books. We made a talking book. It’s not going to take you more than five minutes to get through.” Cantave plans to raise funds to produce and distribute the book through Kickstarter. Ideally, the picture book will reach people the public hearings didn’t ― namely, younger, working class New Yorkers unable to attend an event on a weekday at 10 a.m. This, Cantave speculates, is partially why the majority of the public hearings’ attendees were older, white and predominately in favor of protecting the monuments. “That skewed the distribution of opinions present,” Cantave said.  “Who was my age who was there?” Cantave asked. “It was mostly white senior citizens with conservative opinions,” he added, noting that the only other people in attendance were either engaged in monument work full time or journalists. “The symbols of hate disproportionately affect communities of color and they were not accurately represented. This was supposed to be a display of New Yorkers’ opinions, but it wasn’t.” Most who testified during the five hearings spoke in defense of Columbus’ statue, if not the man himself. As Queens resident Virginia Caputo put it, “We should not live in a vacuum and judge our statues by our values and standards of today. We are a tolerant and progressive city, humanity had a long and complicated struggle to achieve where we are today.” “Rome, the ultimate Catholic city, could take down the Colosseum, a symbol of hate where so many early Christians were brutally treated,” she added. “America, New York City is who we are today because of that long road. Don’t erase that.”  Cantave rejects, however, the notion that New Yorkers are solely viewing Columbus from a 21st century lens. “The Spanish empire who put Columbus in power decided he was too cruel as the governor of Hispaniola and put him in jail. This is a matter of objective morality. It transcends centuries,” he said. And as for tearing down cultural relics, Cantave categorically believes that statues glorifying oppressors don’t deserve to be saved. “I’m all for destroying a culture that is governed by white supremacy,” he said. “Black and brown people have been uncomfortable for centuries. The culture needs to shift. Everyone knows who Adolf Hitler is so you don’t see any monuments of him in New York. Let’s be on the right side of history.”"
ARTS & CULTURE,The Art Of Keeping Guantánamo Open,"We spent the day at a beach in Brooklyn. Skyscrapers floated in the distance and my toddler kept handing me cigarette filters she had dug out of the sand. When we got home, I checked my email. I had been sent a picture of a very different beach: deserted, framed by distant headlands with unsullied sands and clear waters. As it happened, I was looking not at a photograph, but at a painting by a man imprisoned at the Guantánamo Bay detention camp. Of the roughly 780 people once imprisoned there, he is one of 41 prisoners who remain, living yards away from the Caribbean Sea. Captives from the Bush administration’s Global War on Terror began to arrive at that offshore prison in January 2002. Since Guantánamo is located on a military base in Cuba and the detainees were labeled “alien enemy combatants,” they were conveniently to be without rights under either United States or international law and so open to years of whatever their jailers wanted to do to them (including torture). President Barack Obama released 197 of them in his years in office, but was unable to fulfill the promise he made on his first day: to close Guantánamo. The man whose painting I saw has been held for nearly 15 years without trial, without even having charges filed against him. The email came from his lawyer who had volunteered to defend a number of Guantánamo detainees. Some had been released after she helped them convince a military tribunal that they were no longer “threats” to the United States. The others remain in indefinite detention. Many of her clients pass their time by making art and, of all the unexpected things to come into my life, she was now looking for a curator who wanted to exhibit some of their paintings. Collecting the Art of Guantánamo I’m a professor at John Jay College in New York City. It has a small art gallery and so one day in August 2016 I found myself in that lawyer’s midtown Manhattan office preparing, however dubiously, to view the art of her clients. She was pushing aside speakerphones and notepads and laying out the artwork on a long table in a conference room whose windows overlooked the picturesque East River. As I waited, I watched from high up as the water cut a swath of silence through the city. When I finally turned my attention to the art, I was startled to see some eerily similar views. Painting after painting of water. Water trickling through the reeds at the edge of a pond. Water churning into foam as it ran over rocks in rivers. Calmly flowing water that reflected the buildings along a canal. But above all, there was the sea. Everywhere, the sea.  In those paintings in that conference room and in other work sent to me as word spread among detainees and their lawyers that I was willing to plan an exhibit, I found hundreds of depictions of the sea in all its moods. In some paintings, storms thrashed apart the last planks of sinking ships. In others, boats were moored safely at docks or scudded across vast expanses of water without a hint of shore in sight. Clouds bunched in blue midday skies or burned orange in mid-ocean sunsets. One detainee had even made elaborate models of sailing ships out of cardboard, old T-shirts, bottle caps, and other scraps of trash. Puzzled, I asked the lawyer, “Why all the water?” She shrugged. Maybe the art instructor at the prison, she suggested, was giving the detainees lots of pictures of the sea. The detainees, it turned out, could actually take art classes as long as they remained “compliant.” But when there was a crackdown, as there had, for instance, been during a mass hunger strike in 2013, the guards promptly confiscated their art ― and that was the reason the lawyer’s clients had asked her to take it.  They wanted to keep their work (and whatever it meant to them) safe from the guards. Muhammad Ansi, Untitled (Pier), 2016. As it turned out, the art doesn’t leave Guantánamo that much more easily than the prisoners themselves. Military authorities scrutinized every piece for hidden messages and then stamped the back of each work, “Approved by US Forces.” Those stamps generally bled through, floating up into the surface of the image on the other side. The lawyer had even nicknamed one of the model ships the U.S.S. Approved because the censors had stamped those words across its sails. So I found myself beginning to plan an exhibition of a sort I had never in my wildest dreams imagined I would curate. And I began to worry. A curator makes so many choices, judgments, interpretations of art. But how could I make them with any kind of accuracy when I was a woman, a non-Muslim, and a citizen of the very nation that had detained these men for so many years without charges or trial?  Wasn’t I, in other words, the ultimate Other? Greek to Me By training, I’m a classical art historian. I expand fragments. If I show my students a broken ancient Greek vase, I use my words to mend it. I pour in more words to fill it with the memory of the wine it once carried, yet more to conjure up the men who once drank from it, and still more to offer my students our best guesses at what they might have been talking about as they drank. This mode of dealing with art was known to the ancient Greeks.  They called it ekphrasis: the rhetorical exercise of describing a work of art in great detail. For them, ekphrasis was a creative act. The speaker often explained things not shown by the artist, such as what happened just before or just after the illustrated moment. The maiden in this painting is smiling because she has just received a declaration of love, they would say. But faced with this art from Guantánamo, ekphrasis seemed somehow inappropriate. These artists are still alive, even if entombed. Their artworks are as they intended them, not the fragmentary remains of some past world that needs a framework of interpretation. And whatever interpretation these might need, how in the world was I to provide it?  Who was I to pour my words over them? And yet I knew that they needed help or why would that lawyer have come to me? The detainees certainly couldn’t curate their own exhibit in New York because they would be barred from entering the United States even after being released from Guantánamo. So I told myself that I would have to help them realize their desire for an exhibit without inserting my own judgments. I told myself that I would instead be their amanuensis. From the Latin: a manu, servant of the hand, the term once referring to someone who aided in an artistic project by taking dictation. Consider, for instance, John Milton’s daughters, Mary and Deborah, who took down his seventeenth century epic poem Paradise Lost after he had gone blind. They were his amanuenses.  He composed the verses in his head at night.  Then, in the morning, as a contemporary of his wrote, he “sat leaning backward obliquely in an easy chair, with his leg flung over the elbow of it” while they wrote down what he recited. If they dawdled coming to him, he would complain that he needed to be milked. Ghaleb Al-Bihani, Untitled (Red and Purple Boats), 2015. I would similarly let the artists speak for themselves through me, or so I thought. I wrote out a list of questions for their lawyers to ask them, including “What do you like about making art?” and “What would you like people to think about when they are looking at your art?” Then I waited for those lawyers to pose them during their Guantánamo visits in the midst of conferences about legal matters.   The answers were strikingly uniform and seemingly unrevealing.  They wanted people to see their art, they said, and through it know that they are actual human beings. Really?  I didn’t get it. Of course, they’re human beings. What else could they be? At first, I wasn’t too concerned that their answers didn’t really make much sense to me. That’s part of the role of an amanuensis.  Milton’s daughters were ten and six when he began Paradise Lost. It would take them all nearly a decade to finish it. In those years, their father also taught them to read books aloud to him in Greek, Latin, and Hebrew, of which they couldn’t understand a word. I was used to being an amanuensis myself. When I was a year and a half old and my mother was still pregnant with my sister, my father had an accident and broke his neck. The fractured edge of a vertebra sliced into his spinal cord, leaving his arms and legs paralyzed. As soon as we were old enough ― and I can’t remember a time when we weren’t considered old enough ― my sister and I would spend hours a day being his “hands.” We opened mail, paid bills, slid computer disks in and out of the desktop that he operated by stabbing at the keys with a long pointer held in his mouth. Through us, two daydreamy little girls, he did all the work of a stereotypical man of the house ― fixing broken appliances, hanging Christmas lights, grilling steak. To be an amanuensis is, by the way, anything but a passive act. After all, there wouldn’t be enough time in the world if you had to tell your own hands what to do in every situation: reach for the coffee cup, close that finger around its handle, bring it to your mouth. In the same way, an amanuensis must anticipate needs, prepare tools, and know when something’s missing. And this sense that something was missing ― honed from my years with my father ― was growing in me as I looked at the artwork and thought about those responses. It was the midsummer of 2017 and the exhibit was set to open in the fall.  The file cabinets in my office were filled with paintings, overflowing into piles on the floor that came up to my shins. After the struggle to pry those artworks out of Guantánamo, I didn’t know how to say that one piece should be seen by the world and another should stay a prisoner in some dark drawer. Freedom of the Seas So I asked again ― this time by emailing Mansoor Adayfi, a former detainee working on a memoir about his time at Guantánamo. He explained that the cells of detainees were right by the sea.  They could smell and hear the surf, but because tarps blocked their view, they could never see it. Only once, when a hurricane was coming, had the guards removed those tarps from the fences that separated them from the water. A few days later, when they went back up, the artist-inmates began to draw pictures of the sea as a substitute for what they had glimpsed during that brief moment of visual freedom. Suddenly, those endless visions of water ― that is, of freedom ― made sense to me.  And I understood something else as well.  Guantánamo is a system designed to paint the men it holds as monsters, animals, sub-humans who don’t deserve basic rights like fair trials.  That was the reason those prisoners were speaking, but not speaking, in their art. Why would they say anything that risked a further fall from whatever precarious hold on humanity they still had? They hoped someday to be released, which was unlikely to happen if the authorities became convinced that they bore any anger towards the United States. And even release would not mean freedom of speech, since they would be sent to countries that had agreed to host them. Dependent on the good graces of these governments, they would continue to live constrained lives in constrained circumstances, needing never to offend these new sets of authorities either. Khalid Qasim, Untitled (Fins in the Ocean), 2016. I was indeed the Other. I might misinterpret and misrepresent, but so undoubtedly would anyone else in our world speaking for those artists. And they were incapable of speaking for themselves. So I added an essay of my own to the catalog, becoming ekphrastic. I pointed out what was movingly missing in their artwork. It wasn’t that there weren’t people in their paintings.  It was that those works had invisible holes where the people should have been. All those unmanned boats, sailing across those open waters, were carrying invisible self-portraits of the artists as they hardly dared to imagine themselves: free. Even when there were no boats, the famously mutable sea served as the perfect disguise. Its winds and waves and rocks represented the all-too-human emotions of the artists without ever making them visible to the censors. It was, of course, so much less dangerous for me to interpret what they were saying than for them to say it directly. I had held many doors open for my father when I was his amanuensis, running ahead to make sure the path was clear and that there were no surprising flights of stairs. If there were, it was up to me to find a new way. This is what I wanted to do for the artists. Open doors, scout out paths ― but their choice of doors, their choice of paths, not mine. They had told me they wanted people to see them as human beings and that was the case I tried to make for them. As it turned out, I evidently succeeded a little too well. After the exhibit opened and received a surprising amount of media attention, the artists’ lawyers noticed that the authorities were taking longer and longer to clear artworks to leave Guantánamo. Then, three weeks ago, the Department of Defense declared that all art made at Guantánamo is government property. Detainees reported that their guards then told them any art left behind if they were ever released would be burned and works in their cells deemed “excess” would simply be discarded. As with so many policy decisions about Guantánamo, the true rationale for this one remains hidden. My guess: the U.S. authorities there were surprised that the artwork they had been scrutinizing so carefully for hidden messages had a unifying one they had missed: that its makers were human beings. Which is precisely the realization the authorities need to stop the rest of us from having if Guantánamo is to remain open. Erin L.

ARTS & CULTURE,This New York Activist Wants To Replace A Statue Of Columbus With Toussaint L’Ouverture,"In 2013, when Glenn Cantave was an undergrad student studying abroad in Bolivia, he did as many tourists do in the country and visited the colossal statue of Cristo de la Concordia, one of the largest depictions of Jesus in the world. For many Bolivians, the statue is a site of national pride. The 133-foot figure towers over visitors clamoring to take his photo, his arms outstretched as if offering a giant hug. But for Cantave, something about it felt wrong. “I have nothing bad to say about Jesus as a guy,” he told HuffPost. “But Bolivia has one of the largest indigenous cultures in South America and the religion of Christianity was imposed on its people. This image of a white man looking down on everyone was very problematic.”  The experience shifted Cantave’s perspective on the relationship between men perched on pedestals and the communities obliged to literally look up to them every day. But the monument that angers him most, however, is the one at home: a 76-foot statue of Christopher Columbus, a man who Cantave unequivocally calls a terrorist, in Manhattan.  “A terrorist is someone who intimidates people for a political cause,” Cantave said. “For him, that cause was the expansion of the Spanish Empire for profit. Columbus threatened and raped and murdered. It is ass backwards that a city like New York, with such a high awareness of terrorism, has a terrorist as a landmark.” I met Cantave at Queens Borough Hall, at the first of five public hearings addressing what should become of New York City’s contentious monuments. Cantave attended and testified at four of the hearings.  Concern over what should become of the controversial monuments ― which Mayor Bill de Blasio referred to as “symbols of hate” ― bubbled over in August when a white supremacist rally protesting the removal of a Confederate statue in Charlottesville, Virginia, turned violent, resulting in the murder of counterprotester and anti-racist activist Heather Heyer. Shortly thereafter, protests erupted in New York demanding the removal of a statue of Dr. J. Marion Sims. Though he is known as the “father of gynecology,” he has a legacy of torturing enslaved women, performing “experimental surgeries” on them without anesthesia. In early September, de Blasio announced that he was forming a committee, called the Mayoral Advisory Commission on City Art, Monuments and Markers, to advise him on what should become of the various controversial monuments strewn throughout the five boroughs. The commission ― co-chaired by Darren Walker, the president of the Ford Foundation, and Tom Finkelpearl, commissioner of NYC’s department of cultural affairs ― includes artists, architects, professors, activists and scholars of a cross-section of ages, races and genders. Together, they invited interested citizens of various neighborhoods to take the floor of public hearings and share their opinions on the fates of monuments in question, such as statues of Christopher Columbus, Theodore Roosevelt and J. Marion Sims. In Queens, Cantave addressed a moderate crowd, many of whom were protective of the Columbus statue. Panelists spoke of its historical significance and value to some Italian immigrants. “What this says to me is that my life as a black man does not matter,” Cantave told the room. “My last name is Cantave, it’s a slave owner’s last name. I don’t know my real last name because of Columbus.” Cantave is the founder and CEO of Movers and Shakers, an activist coalition that uses innovative techniques like virtual and augmented reality to advocate for marginalized and oppressed populations. The organization is currently advocating for the removal of the statues that honor these men. Over 120 artists and scholars from around the country published an open letter on Friday with similar demands, requesting the removal of Columbus, Roosevelt and Sims monuments along with statues of Vichy France’s Nazi collaborators Philippe Pétain and Pierre Laval.  The letter reads in part:  “By far the most controversial of the monuments is that to Christopher Columbus, who served the Spanish crown, and spoke and wrote only in Catalan. Because he was born in Genoa in 1451 – a city that did not become “Italy” until the unification of the country in 1861 – he was adopted as a patriotic symbol by Italian immigrants in the nineteenth century. But the public claim of “ownership” of Columbus by Italian-Americans cannot be allowed to override his key role in the historical genocide of Indigenous peoples of the Americas. By 1600, at least 50 million Indigenous people died in this hemisphere as a result of the Columbian encounter with Europeans, whether from war, disease or enslavement. It takes only a little understanding to see why their descendants do not regard anything associated with 1492 as an object of veneration.” Cantave doesn’t just want to remove the monument to Columbus, though. Instead, he suggests replacing the statue with a tribute to Toussaint L’Ouverture, who led the Haitian Revolution in the 18th century. New York has the second highest Haitian population of any U.S. state. Yet L’Ouverture’s significance, Cantave believes, extends beyond the scope of the Haitian diaspora.  “In general, monuments reflect financial glory,” he said. “Oppressed peoples don’t have role models to look up to. L’Ouverture’s efforts resulted in the establishment of the first, free black republic. If you had him glorified as a statue and his name in the textbooks, that would change everything.” Cantave believes that manifestations of white supremacy today ― in alt-right chatrooms and at pro-Donald Trump rallies ― stem from the same colonizing mindset Columbus brought to America. “Why is the erasure of black and brown history a recurring theme?” he asked. Earlier this month, he demonstrated the parallels by staging the “Slave Auction 2017” performance in Herald Square, forcing New Yorkers to confront the consequences of Columbus’ historical exploits head on. Protesters formed a procession in the middle of Manhattan, some wearing shackles and others prison uniforms and handcuffs.  “Columbus entered the Americas with the intent of enslaving its inhabitants for the economic benefit of the Spanish crown,” the project description explains. Genocide expert David Stannard estimates that Columbus and Europeans under his leadership killed between 70 million and 100 million indigenous people beginning in 1492. Between 1500 and 1866, approximately 12.5 million people were kidnapped from Africa and enslaved in America. “It was only after his men realized that their slaves were not resistant to European diseases did they decide to use forced labor from West Africa,” Cantave said.  Cantave will continue mounting protests against Columbus’ monument until a decision has been made regarding its future. He’s also working on a Columbus picture book, White Supremacy 101: Columbus the Hero?, that uses augmented reality to amend the falsehoods embedded in the whitewashed history that is often recounted in schools. Working with a team of illustrators, animators, poets, rappers and historians, Cantave transformed black-and-white drawings into animated narratives that come alive with the help of an iPhone. Each page of the book features a five- to seven-second animation loop generated from academically verified accounts of Columbus’ actions.  His live action protests, including a public presentation of “Slave Auction 2017” and an upcoming event on Dec. 3 in Times Square, involve animated excerpts from his upcoming augmented reality book, blown up as 24-by-36-inch prints.  With the book, Cantave hopes to appeal to a scope of readers beyond historians and academics. “A lot of people do not care about Christoper Columbus,” he said. “He’s engrained in our society, but people don’t know what he did. There are people out there who have done the work and told the truth, but if you’re not an academic or a university student, chances are you’re never going to pick up one of their books. We made a talking book. It’s not going to take you more than five minutes to get through.” Cantave plans to raise funds to produce and distribute the book through Kickstarter. Ideally, the picture book will reach people the public hearings didn’t ― namely, younger, working class New Yorkers unable to attend an event on a weekday at 10 a.m. This, Cantave speculates, is partially why the majority of the public hearings’ attendees were older, white and predominately in favor of protecting the monuments. “That skewed the distribution of opinions present,” Cantave said.  “Who was my age who was there?” Cantave asked. “It was mostly white senior citizens with conservative opinions,” he added, noting that the only other people in attendance were either engaged in monument work full time or journalists. “The symbols of hate disproportionately affect communities of color and they were not accurately represented. This was supposed to be a display of New Yorkers’ opinions, but it wasn’t.” Most who testified during the five hearings spoke in defense of Columbus’ statue, if not the man himself. As Queens resident Virginia Caputo put it, “We should not live in a vacuum and judge our statues by our values and standards of today. We are a tolerant and progressive city, humanity had a long and complicated struggle to achieve where we are today.” “Rome, the ultimate Catholic city, could take down the Colosseum, a symbol of hate where so many early Christians were brutally treated,” she added. “America, New York City is who we are today because of that long road. Don’t erase that.”  Cantave rejects, however, the notion that New Yorkers are solely viewing Columbus from a 21st century lens. “The Spanish empire who put Columbus in power decided he was too cruel as the governor of Hispaniola and put him in jail. This is a matter of objective morality. It transcends centuries,” he said. And as for tearing down cultural relics, Cantave categorically believes that statues glorifying oppressors don’t deserve to be saved. “I’m all for destroying a culture that is governed by white supremacy,” he said. “Black and brown people have been uncomfortable for centuries. The culture needs to shift. Everyone knows who Adolf Hitler is so you don’t see any monuments of him in New York. Let’s be on the right side of history.”"
ARTS & CULTURE,Actual Asian Comic Writers Respond To Marvel Editor-In-Chief's 'Yellowface' Controversy,"As the comic industry grapples with the revelation that new Marvel editor-in-chief C.B. Cebulski posed as an Asian writer for a year, real writers of Asian descent are speaking up.  Joshua Luna and Trung Le Nguyen, who’ve both been involved in comic projects tied to the Asian-American experience, chatted with HuffPost following Cebulski’s admission. The new editor-in-chief, confirmed that he’d written under the Japanese-sounding pseudonym “Akira Yoshida” in the early 2000s. Cebulski had even created an elaborate false backstory for Yoshida, drawing criticism from people of Asian descent who labeled his actions as “yellowface.”  Cebulski released a statement saying he had been “young and naive” at the time and the issue was “all old news that has been dealt with.” But both Luna and Nguyen feel that damage has been done.   “It’s equal parts shocking, disappointing and discouraging,” Luna told HuffPost. “It’s not necessarily strange to use a pseudonym, but to use an Asian pen name when someone’s not of Asian descent is wild to me, especially when so many actual Asians are constantly denied access to these kinds of opportunities.” Luna explained that Cebulski’s actions sting in part because of Marvel’s long history of problematic representation of Asians in its comics. Its “Iron Fist” series has been criticized for perpetuating a white savior narrative. “Daredevil” received backlash for its ninjas who were given little more than two-dimensional, stereotypical stories. And “Doctor Strange’s” Tibetan “The Ancient One” is thought to be another incarnation of the “old Asian sage” stereotype. The list goes on, as Gizmodo points out. All these titles made it on screen and little was done to remedy the issues in the plots. In fact, actress Tilda Swinton even ended up whitewashing the part of “The Ancient One.”  What’s more, the company once blamed diversity for a dip in sales following a 2014 push for inclusion ― a claim that the Independent proved untrue as diverse stories including “Ms. Marvel” and “Black Panther” were both top selling comics.  Luna wonders that with such an attitude towards inclusion at Marvel, perhaps Cebulski’s Yoshida has harmed writers of Asian descent. “It makes you wonder just how many Asian comic book writers were turned away because an “Akira Yoshida” was already filling the “Asian quota.” With Cebulski moving forward as editor-in-chief, Luna says that it appears Marvel hasn’t learned its lesson. He believes that the company’s insistence that inclusivity and racial sensitivity are important to them is a “hollow” statement.  “This ‘Akira Yoshida’ story sends yet another message of Asian culture being desired, but not actual Asian people,” he said.  For Nguyen, who goes by “Trungles” professionally, Cebulski’s actions have greater implications that extend beyond the confines of comics. Cebulski’s choice to pose behind an Asian name exemplifies a privilege that Asian immigrant families simply are not afforded.  “Asian-Americans, have had to adapt more English sounding names in great part to help ensure economic survivability for ourselves and our families. It’s a necessity for the sake of our access to professional advancement, to jobs,” Nguyen explained. “In Cebulski’s case, he’s a white man who’s taken on a Japanese pen name, [circumventing] internal rules of employment, while also lending a veneer of credence to the purported ‘Japaneseness’ of his writing.” Nguyen called the act of adjusting a name for profit or just to assume an aesthetic, rather than for survival, “troubling.” Moreover, Cebulski’s remark that the situation had been “dealt with” made it seem as though the editor-in-chief was “one-and-done” when it comes to learning from the matter, Nguyen said.  In light of the backlash that ensued following another incident in literature in which it was revealed that a poem by “Yi-Fen Chou,” in the 2015 edition of Best American Poetry, was actually penned by Michael Derrick Hudson of Fort Wayne, Indiana, Luna feels that Cebulski should step down. But only time will tell if Marvel is willing to truly make moves towards real and responsible diversity. UPDATE: Dec. 20 ― In a statement to The Atlantic on Dec. 17, Cebulski said he was “truly sorry for the pain, anger, and disappointment I caused over my poor choice of pseudonym.” He referred to the decision to use the Yoshida name as a “misstep” and mentioned that since the news broke, he’s spoken with “talent close to this issue” and has had discussions around being “mindful of the voices behind them.” “My passion has always been about bringing the best talent from across the world to work on the best stories in the world, and I’m hopeful that fans and creators alike will join us in that continued mission,” he wrote.  His remarks, however, failed to win over critics who pointed out that he only apologized for the use of the pseudonym itself but did not acknowledge the consequences of assuming a Japanese-inspired identity."
ARTS & CULTURE,Beastie Boys' Adam Horovitz Says He Believes Women Accusing His Father Of Sexual Assault,"Nine women have accused American playwright Israel Horovitz of sexual assault. A New York Times article published on Thursday details the women’s allegations, which range from accounts of forced kissing to rape. Two of the women were just 16 years old when the alleged assaults occurred. One of the playwright’s children, Adam Horovitz of the Beastie Boys, said he believes the women who have come forward against his father. “I believe the allegations against my father are true, and I stand behind the women that made them,” the hip-hop artist told the Times in a statement. One of the accusers, Jocelyn Meinhardt, had dated Adam Horovitz in high school. She was 19 years old when she started a summer fellowship with his father at the Gloucester Stage Company in Massachusetts, where the playwright served as artistic director. Meinhardt told the Times that on the first night of the fellowship, Israel Horovitz drove her to his family’s home, where he allegedly raped her. Like the other women who came forward, Meinhardt described Horovitz as someone she had looked up to, and who took advantage of her youth and respect to victimize her. “He was a good mentor, until he was the worst, probably most nightmarish mentor you could have,” Meinhardt said. Israel Horovitz, 78, said in a statement to the Times that he has “a different memory of some of these events.” But he added: “I apologize with all my heart to any woman who has ever felt compromised by my actions, and to my family and friends who have put their trust in me. To hear that I have caused pain is profoundly upsetting, as is the idea that I might have crossed a line with anyone who considered me a mentor.” The elder Horovitz is the author of more than 70 plays and multiple screenplays, including the adaptation of his stage play “My Old Lady,” which was released in 2014 and starred actors Maggie Smith and Kevin Kline. The accusations against the playwright are the latest in a string of sexual assault allegations that have rocked entertainment, media and politics. NBC’s Matt Lauer and Minnesota Public Radio’s Garrison Keillor were both fired from their positions on Wednesday amid allegations of sexual misconduct and improper behavior. Two more women accused Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) of sexual harassment on Thursday, bringing the number of accusers against the senator to six. Also on Thursday, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said she believed that Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) should resign in light of multiple sexual misconduct allegations against him from former female staffers."

ARTS & CULTURE,How A 90-Year-Old Bookstore Got Into The Business Of Totes,"Those who are familiar with New York’s Strand Book Store can likely recall its slogan: “18 miles of books.” It’s right there on the store’s ubiquitous red oval logo, seen citywide on tote bags carried by well-read locals and tourists alike. But today, the 90-year-old Manhattan institution selling new and used books boasts closer to 23 miles of the printed word. (It’s measured, by the way, by book spines, exactly how they sit on the shelf.)  “I think 18 miles has such a nice ring to it,” senior designer Topher MacDonald said, recalling an old store awning that originally read “8 miles of books.” Eventually, “somebody tacked a 1 on top of it because [the store] had gotten too big,” he added. However long the Strand’s stock is, the phrase is beautifully evocative. For a book lover catching sight of the slogan on a tote ambling around Central Park, it conjures images of never-ending stacks, more stories and curious plots than can be devoured in a lifetime.  Indeed, it’s the humble canvas tote, first sold at the Strand in the 1980s, that allows a bibliophile on-the-go to subtly transmit that image — and an image of themselves, too.  Current store co-owner Nancy Bass Wyden — the granddaughter of store founder Ben Bass — told HuffPost that the first iteration of the Strand tote was designed by a former longtime floor manager named Richard Devereaux. It had simple block letters, spelling out the store’s name, address and phone number on canvas. That design persisted until the ’90s, when the bookstore’s now-famous red oval logo replaced it. The newer design, attributed to another floor manager’s girlfriend at the time, features the bookstore’s name in Strand Gothic (the store’s own font). The initial tote was relatively small; it held only two or three books at a time. But it grew, and the designs became more varied, as the Strand began ramping up its merchandise section around 2012. “My dad [Fred Bass] kind of resisted for many years. You know, ‘What are you doing to this place?! We should just have serious books!’” Bass Wyden said. He came around to the idea, she said, because it pleased customers. “That was, and is, the most important thing to him,” she said. The Strand has now offered over 100 original tote designs, ranging from political to whimsical. Walking around the store, you can spot canvas homages to Frida Kahlo and Michelle Obama laid out on tables, or get lost in an intricate hand-drawn city scene printed on a bag. There are totes with useful additions like zippers or small phone-sized pockets. Books and tote bags go together naturally — one is an object to be carried, the other carries it. So it makes sense that Strand customers would gravitate toward the bookstore’s bags.  The appeal of a tote, however, goes beyond mere utility. On the surface, any Strand tote signals that its owner enjoys books. Perhaps the owner would also like to be seen supporting independent bookstores — an ever-more-political stance as Amazon and its ilk cast a long shadow over small businesses. Perhaps they have a connection to New York City; whether they live there, visit there, or know someone who visits there, they proudly flaunt the affiliation. Once you start looking, it’s easy to spot a Strand tote or three on an average crowded subway. Their sheer ubiquity means the bags inevitably lose a factor or two of cool. In 2011, Vol. 1 Brooklyn riffed on the associations begotten by various literary totes, suggesting the typical Strand tote owner “probably [doesn’t] actually live in New York. Either that, or you’re a freshman at NYU.” Still, for lit lovers who are unconcerned with urban cachet, there are plenty of options. Customers can buy a bag to communicate even more specific facts about themselves: I love cats. I am a feminist. Shakespeare is my personal superhero. I will not f**k someone who doesn’t own any books. “We know that people that love books, love cats,” Bass Wyden said, reiterating a likely facet of many habitual readers’ personalities: They enjoy the indoors. “We always try to keep that in mind, you know: cozy, fireplace, coffee, tea.” Hand-drawn designs — a trend seen popping up on book covers themselves ― have also proved popular, which Bass Wyden suggested was a result of the “backlash from technology” and living in an increasingly digital world.  Each tote mentions the Strand’s name in some way, usually showcasing that same red oval logo. (The Strand merchandizing team briefly tried a few other designs, replacing the “miles of books” slogan with the phrase “Where books are loved,” but ultimately went back to the original.) Nearly 50 of the designs are credited to MacDonald, who began working out on the art department floor around five years ago. His handiwork ranges from delicate, multicolor illustrations of New Yorkers going about their day to an image of an extensively detailed library with ceiling-high bookshelves and cats around each turn. MacDonald says the idea of a “weird, introvert fantasy world” inspired one of his latest designs: a dusty shelf stocked with a compass, a bell jar, a skull, books and other oddities, all presided over by a black cat. “Stay Curious,” it reads. Ultimately, the designs come out of a collaborative process, with Bass Wyden and other staff members contributing ideas to a department called Studio Strand, which also consists of designers Greg Locke and Alison George and manager Meagan Henry. MacDonald, who hand-draws designs on a tablet, said that the collaboration can lead to little visual “Easter eggs” on the totes. MacDonald included his dog in a tableau of the city’s canine population. On another bag, the Japanese character for “book” takes the place of the “A” in “Strand” — another fun wink for those in the know.  At first glance, the store’s “Victorian Reader” seems to depict a straightforward scene of old-timey New York, with older building facades, horse-drawn carriages and people in the street with their noses in books. Upon closer inspection, the attention to detail — creepy detail ― emerges. There’s a Headless Horseman statue and a violent barber inspired by Sweeney Todd. A carriage is being driven by a skeleton. Two identical twins ride eerily by on a tandem bicycle. “I think [Bass Wyden was] just like, ‘Wouldn’t it be creepy if there were some abandoned shoes in the street?’” MacDonald recalled. “It’s fun to create these opportunities for everyone. Like, what happens if you put a cobweb over here, or what happens if you put, like, a skull at the top of a building?” he continued. “Just making it as immersive as possible.” Elsewhere in the design, a frustrated writer tosses his papers out the window. In another window, Bass Wyden’s grandfather peers out at the scene below. The design has been in the merchandise rotation for several years. “It really is all of that detail that really makes it, you know, resonate for so long,” MacDonald added. With an in-house design team, the bookstore can also adapt quickly to emerging trends and new catchphrases. When “Hamilton” was selling out nightly, a “Young, Scrappy and Hungry” bag popped up on shelves. When the coloring book craze seized bookstores around 2014, Strand answered with a tote featuring outlines of New York staples: a pigeon, the MetroCard. The bookstore also offered “F**k 2016” pins and “Make America Read Again” totes: bold statements in a bold election year that allowed people to wear not just their love of reading, but their frustration, on their sleeves. “I kept saying, ‘Don’t order too much! He’s not gonna be around!’” Bass Wyden said with a laugh, referring, of course, to now-President Donald Trump. The resistance is alive, well and for sale at the bookstore, where Ruth Bader Ginsburg totes lie on a table near others that read, “Nevertheless, She Persisted.” A tote with the saying “A well-read woman is a dangerous creature” features what looks like a straightforward floral motif against black canvas, but upon further inspection, there are bees sprinkled throughout ― subtly underscoring the “dangerous creature” note. Other totes are collaborations with beloved artists like Art Spiegelman and Adrian Tomine. Other designs have come from happenstance. Bass Wyden said a manager who collected autographs and drawings asked painter David Hockney to draw him a picture when he visited the store in the ’70s. Hockney drew a bag of books, which eventually became a tote.  “I thought that was funny, to put a tote on a tote,” Bass Wyden said. For bookstore purists, the growth of the Strand’s in-store merchandise ― increasingly catering to an in-and-out kind of customer rather than one content to spend hours among the stacks ― might seem at odds with the store’s history as a haven for literature and those who love it. It’s understandable that seeing space occupied by bags advertising the store’s lengthy selection of books, instead of the books themselves, could chafe a certain kind of reader. But if a bookstore must diversify its offerings to offset changing publishing trends or to reflect customer tastes, the creations tailored for bibliophiles at the Strand seem like a practical, and charming, way to meet in the middle. In a way, the many canvas bags on offer echo the varied customers drawn to the store in order to peruse its curated tables and outdoor carts — creative, singular, true New York originals."
ARTS & CULTURE,'Mudbound' Has More To Say About Whiteness In America Than Any Other Trump-Era Movie,"The new Netflix movie “Mudbound,” directed by Dee Rees, is an epic about race in the Deep South in the aftermath of World War II. It is also, in a way, about something that happened a few weeks ago.  “The other day,” Rees told me recently, “I was in my pajamas getting ready to walk my dog in the building where I live.” A white guy, “trying to be friendly,” struck up a conversation. “Oh,” he asked, “are you with the dog walking service? Can I get your card?” Rees smiled, though clearly unamused. “I said, ‘No, I live here.’” “Mudbound” is a movie about small moments like these, which almost every black person can relate to. Perhaps no other film has done a better job of capturing the role of emotional labor in the story of race in America, of teasing out the connection between the physical and emotional labor of black folk in this country. The story centers on two families, the McAllans (white) and the Jacksons (black). Henry McAllan (Jason Clarke) moves his wife Laura (Carey Mulligan), two daughters, and ornery father Pappy (Jonathan Banks) onto a large plot of farmland in Mississippi. The McAllans own the land, and Hap and Florence Jackson (Rob Morgan and Mary J. Blige), sharecroppers with four children of their own, work the land. Hap and Florence’s eldest son, Ronsel Jackson (Jason Mitchell), and Henry’s younger brother, Jamie McAllan (Garrett Hedlund), strike up an unlikely friendship based around the shared trauma of the war. The friendship ultimately leads to tragedy. “Mudbound” begins and ends with acts of labor that are layered with meaning. In its first moments, we watch the McAllan brothers dig a muddy grave for their recently deceased father. Later, we watch Henry ask Hap, passing by with his family, to help them lower Pappy into the ground. The dead man was a virulent racist, one who bombarded the Jacksons with his disdain; a man who, as we learn later, endangered the lives of Hap and his family. In that moment, all of this history is left unspoken.  Halfway through the narrative, Florence must leave her children and gravely injured husband in order to tend to Laura’s two sick daughters. It’s an act she says, via internal monologue, that she’d vowed never to do ― to put the needs of someone else’s family over her own. This is the reality of being black in America. “Their lives can be interrupted at any moment,” Rees explained. “You could be reading a letter from your son who is away at war, or having dinner with your family,” she said. “But at any moment you have to stop doing what you’re doing. Your family connections are displaced or your emotion is displaced, and suddenly you have to perform someone else’s convenience.” She is speaking of emotional labor, a concept wound up tightly with the story of white and black America. Emotional labor is the folding and contorting of one’s own emotions for the benefit of others, in order to put them at ease, making space for their feelings by burying your own. In the context of race, this means ignoring offhand racist comments and microaggressions for the sake of keeping the peace, absolving white people of their guilt and swallowing righteous anger.  Emotional labor is not an inherently negative thing. But it becomes so when it’s compelled, without any promise of reciprocation. Black people, especially black women, have perfected the art of emotional labor for the sake of survival.  There is a constant assumption that black women have a bottomless capacity to provide emotional labor for nothing in return. The “Mammy” figure is the personification of this idea: a woman who is always jovial, who is devoid of personal desires, who always places the well-being of the white people she serves above her own ― not because she works for them, but because it is in her nature, embedded in her very DNA. This is what’s at play here, as Florence and Hap navigate the constant intrusions of the McAllan family, who demand physical and spiritual work from them with sheepish smiles that suggest a false sense of solidarity, even understanding.  Stuck at the McAllan home for days as the girls recover and as her own children and husband must cope at home without her, Florence shares a few tender moments with Laura, bonding with her as one mother to another. The next night, Pappy arrives home and accosts Florence with racist taunts and slurs and threats of violence. Laura looks on in silence as Florence de-escalates the confrontation by herself.  The McAllans and the Jacksons are tied together, tied to this land, whether they like it or not. It’s a perfect metaphor for race in America itself ― a problem that’s more than just a problem, that isn’t the burden of just one group but of many.  Because the other crucial thing “Mudbound” explores is the idea of inheritance. We inherit the burden of race, we inherit the burden of emotional labor, and we inherit not just the notion of whiteness as a form of social wealth, but the wealth itself ― just as we inherit the land and the power that goes with it. “Each of the McAllans has whiteness as currency,” Rees said. “They just spend it differently.” “Pappy flaunts his,” she went on. “He’s calling Ronsel a nigger and making him use the back door. Henry may not be calling you names, but he’s happy to walk up to your window and say, ‘Hey, get up on your broken leg and come help me out.’ And Laura, she barters with hers. She’s ‘asking’ Florence to help her girls, but she’s not asking.” “And then with Jamie, he tries to pretend he doesn’t have it, which is equally as dangerous,” Rees added. “By pretending he doesn’t have his privilege, he endangers Ronsel’s life.” In this way, the McAllans are whiteness in all its various shades, all the shades of complicity that come with choosing to accept or reject whiteness as a currency. By the end of the film, after its brutal conclusion, it’s hard to tell which of the McAllans ― Laura, Pappy, Henry or Jamie ― is truly to blame for all the bad things that have transpired between both families. And that, probably, is the point.  “A lot of people say, ‘I’m not racist,’” Rees told me. “I think what they’re really saying is, ‘I don’t hate.’ But you can be racist without being hateful.”  This idea, that one can be racist without being hateful, reverberates through the world of the film and, of course, through the real world as well. The image of Florence nursing the grandchildren of a man who calls her a black bitch lies on the same continuum as Dee Rees, a queer black female director, being mistaken for a dog walker by her white neighbor in Brooklyn. Pappy is hateful. The white neighbor isn’t. And yet they operate within the same system; they demand the same emotional labor, the same compromising of one’s emotions.  Art about race, about America, should not live in the past. In this respect, “Mudbound” is a film that’s brilliantly contemporary in the way it explores race ― not as a concept, as a tool for a teachable moment, as a way to shock or awe an audience as some films about race in the past year have done. It has no agenda and no “lessons” to teach.  Some people glibly predicted in the days after Donald Trump’s election that it would inspire more meaningful and profound art. But many films about race in America that have been released in the past year, such as “Detroit” and “Beatriz at Dinner,” have had an unfortunate tendency toward a flattening didacticism. The movies march grimly under the banner of their message, taking care not to implicate too much of the white audience. The dynamics of race in America are oversimplified rather than interrogated, and viewers are ushered toward a predetermined reaction. That’s not what Rees is up to in “Mudbound.” Her wish is for those who watch her movie ― white and black ― to investigate their own inner lives as much as the inner lives of the characters. “Unless you investigate what you inherit in terms of ideas, you know, attitudes and thoughts about the world, how can you be mindful about what you’re passing on?” Rees said. America is a shared dream, a shared trauma, a shared problem. We’ve all inherited it."
ARTS & CULTURE,"'Complicit' Is The Word Of The Year, According To Dictionary.com","The 2017 Word of the Year is complicit, says Dictionary.com. Complicit, defined as “choosing to be involved in an illegal or questionable act, especially with others,” was the annual pick of a word “indicative of larger trends that resonated throughout the year,” the company said. The choice was made by the online dictionary’s in-house experts ― lexicographers, the marketing and product teams, and the CEO.  “Lookups for the word complicit increased by nearly 300 percent in searches in 2017 as compared to 2016,” Liz McMillan, CEO of Dictionary.com, said in a press release. “We continue to see a direct correlation between trending word lookups and current events, and we find it encouraging that our users are dedicated to understanding the language and words that pop up in the biggest news stories of the year.” Dictionary.com cites many newsworthy 2017 moments that facilitated the use of complicit, including times when people called out the powerful for misdeeds and for silence in the face of wrongdoing. Searches for the word complicit spiked during political happenings, Hollywood scandals and natural disasters, Dictionary.com said. The year’s first surge for the word was on March 12, after a “Saturday Night Live” sketch featuring Scarlett Johansson as Ivanka Trump in a perfume ad for a fictional scent called “Complicit.” The satirical tagline for the fake beauty product was: “The fragrance for the woman who could stop all this, but won’t.” The word cropped up again after reports of collusion between Russia and President Donald Trump during his 2016 campaign, then again after the former head of the Democratic National Committee claimed the party’s nomination of Hillary Clinton was “rigged.”  Searches for complicit also rose when Trump pulled out of the Paris climate accord, “furthering concern that human complicity is hastening our planet’s demise,” Dictionary.com said. Complicit surged again as allegations of sexual misconduct mounted against film executive Harvey Weinstein. The stories of abuse unleashed a boom of claims against the likes of Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore, actor Kevin Spacey, comedian Louis C.K., and many others. The notion of complicity in many of the misconduct scandals is clear: The offender couldn’t have continued perpetrating heinous acts without the silence of others.  Dictionary.com noted in a blog post about its Word of the Year that the selection is “as much about what is visible as it is about what is not.” It’s a word that reminds us that even inaction is a type of action. The silent acceptance of wrongdoing is how we’ve gotten to this point. We must not let this continue to be the norm. If we do, then we are all complicit."
ARTS & CULTURE,Paint The World Bleu,"I’ll never forget the feeling the first time I put myself on display. The people, the lights, the extreme nervousness, but most of all I’ll never forget that first compliment about my painting. Throughout my life, I’ve had the privilege to shadow exceptionally brilliant artists who have extraordinary talent. Coming from a household of artists, I’ve always had a yearning to create, but I didn’t know what I was searching for. As a minority growing up in a low-income environment, I did not have as many opportunities or the exposure to understand what art truly means. Over time an idea developed inside me, an idea that you can express yourself through the stroke of a brush, through the capturing of an idea, a feeling, a moment in a medium ― be that paper, canvas, brick, or a computer screen. In that moment of epiphany my alter ego Bleu Pablo was born. Art has given me the ability to express who I am to the world. My paintings are an extension of myself and are my soul laid bare. To put a single feeling or expression to one piece is to say I am only one feeling or expression; they are as complex and varied as I am. I am my art, and my art is me. Articulating my feelings and thoughts through my art has given me the ability to express myself to the world in a way I never could with words. My goal is to create a platform, a safe space if you will, for emerging artists in the inner city to display their work. I want to give this generation and the ones to follow to have the opportunity to express themselves and empower each other through their work. Through sharing our cultures, experiences and ideas, we cultivate inspiration and grow a communal understanding of life in all its forms. I know it sounds corny, but I want us to create, innovate and motivate within ourselves and our peers. I owe my love of the arts to my creative family, especially my uncle Albert Wrighton who inspired me to give life to my canvas. When I first started and was unsure of my work he would tell me “Don’t stop. You will find yourself.” I feel I finally have done just that. Painting abstract art is my love ― as no other form allows you to draw love, happiness or despair as you see it. I describe my style as abstract with a touch of uptown sauce.

ARTS & CULTURE,The Ugly Business Of Defending Free Speech In 2017,"CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. ― From the outside, the Thomas Jefferson Center for the Protection of Free Expression looks like the idyllic Southern home you never had. Located on a grassy hill, the white building with black shutters is surrounded by silence and crowned by rustling trees. Inside the main house, which was built in 1938, employees and volunteers work to protect one of the most essential tenets of American freedom: the First Amendment. The land beneath their feet was once owned by Thomas Jefferson, the primary author of the Declaration of Independence, who inherited the estate from his father in 1756. As a paragon of free speech as well as a slave owner, Jefferson embodies many of the inconsistencies that have historically plagued the free speech movement since its emergence. The First Amendment governs the right to express an opinion or idea without fear of government retaliation or censorship. “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof;” it reads, “or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.” However, despite the universal ideals espoused in its terminology, when the amendment was ratified, the full protection of its constitutional rights was extended primarily to a select pocket of the population: white, propertied men. The lingering effects of this foundational inequality persist. As a result, the present-day job of protecting free speech can get ugly.  Clay Hansen is executive director of the Thomas Jefferson Center (TJC) and, as such, a professional advocate for free speech and expression. Hansen, a man of imposing stature and rosy complexion, speaks in a measured tone that’s at once authoritative and congenial. On the day we spoke at his place of work, pro athletes around the country were exercising their First Amendment rights by kneeling during the national anthem. They were following the example set by former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who in 2016 began protesting racial injustice in America by taking a knee during the national anthem.  Many mainstream media outlets, politicians and celebrities have valorized Kaepernick’s protests and his invocation of the First Amendment. At the TJC, however, Hansen is tasked with defending both the Kaepernicks of the country and far less palatable practitioners of free speech. “This job is not one you go home and brag about at Thanksgiving dinner,” he explained. “I don’t get to go home and regale my family with stories of defending the Westboro Baptist Church. It’s Nazis and funeral protesters, and it’s tough.” Hansen fights for such individuals’ inalienable right to speak freely because, in his mind, “If we don’t defend these people now, it could be you next.” Since it was inaugurated in 1991, the nonpartisan, nonprofit TJC has fought to protect the right to free expression, no matter how offensive and abhorrent that expression might seem. “The First Amendment applies to everyone,” Hansen said. “It applies to the ignorant and the hateful and everybody else, regardless of how much you disagree with them personally.” Hansen has worked at the center for six years now. Interested in theater and visual art early in his career, he initially tried his luck in New York City’s publishing industry. Eventually he went to law school, had kids and began working as a free speech defender, thinking if he wasn’t making art professionally himself, at least he could champion the rights of those who did. As an institution, the TJC provides legal advocacy in First Amendment court cases. In 2015, Hansen worked on the Supreme Court case Elonis v. United States, in which he argued that “criminal convictions for threatening another person online should require a subjective intent to threaten the recipient of the message, rather than merely showing that a reasonable person would find the message threatening.” Earlier this year, he also represented an Asian-American rock band, The Slants, that was denied federal trademark registration because of the racial slur in the group’s name. The TJC also engages in public outreach and education, and attempts to spread awareness of First Amendment principles nationwide. Other U.S. organizations with similar missions include the James Madison Center for Free Speech in Indiana and The Tully Center for Free Speech at Syracuse University. In particular, the TJC focuses its attention on high school and college campuses, where freedom of expression is regarded with ever-increasing skepticism in 2017. According to a recent survey conducted by The Cato Institute (in collaboration with YouGov), Americans hold varied and contradictory beliefs regarding the First Amendment. However, the results of the institute’s 2,300-person survey showed that, across political and racial divides, a significant portion of respondents agreed that “a big problem this country has is being politically correct,” pointing to college campuses as the issue’s focal point.  Campuses have a long history of playing focal point to freedom of expression debates of all kinds. In December 1964, students at the University of California, Berkeley, began protesting political speech restrictions on campus. The demonstrations continued for months, solidifying UC Berkeley’s symbolic status as the nucleus of the free speech movement. In the years since, the campus’s Sproul Plaza and Mario Savio Steps have been marched on, sat upon and otherwise occupied by an assortment of protests. This past year, though, the famously liberal-leaning university was criticized for censoring conservative voices after canceling speaking engagements by people including Ann Coulter, Steve Bannon and Milo Yiannopoulos. Right-wingers have adopted the fight for free speech as their own, often battling a campus community with an intolerance for intolerance.  In September 2017, Yiannopoulos announced his own “Free Speech Week” at Berkeley. Though it was eventually canceled due to safety concerns, the rally was meant as a platform for the “alt-right” media personality, known for, among other things, calling Black Lives Matter a “terrorist organization” and likening feminism to a “cancer.” Hordes of students and Berkeley citizens protested Yiannopoulos’s presence on campus, chanting, “Nazi scum off our streets!” and “Right-wing fascists go away!” Berkeley’s faculty called for a complete boycott of classes and campus activities, arguing that personalities like Yiannopoulos disfigure the idea of “free speech” to shame and threaten marginalized members of the campus and community.  “There are forms of speech that are not protected under the First Amendment,” members of Berkeley’s faculty wrote in an open letter. “These include speech that presents imminent physical danger and speech that disrupts the university’s mission to educate. ... As faculty, we reject both the administration’s rhetoric of false equivalency that all speech ― including ‘hate speech’ ― merits value and respect.” Hansen stands on the opposite side of this debate. He believes firmly that, no matter how contemptible an idea may be, Americans have the constitutional right to express it. “It’s a difficult time right now to convince people that free speech isn’t only a good idea but one worth fighting for,” Hansen said. “Especially when you’re defending people when you hate what they are saying.” According to Hansen, one of the most common misconceptions when it comes to free speech is that hate speech is excluded from the First Amendment. The Cato Institute found a quarter of Americans erroneously believe it’s against the law to make a racist statement in public. There are certain speech acts that are not permitted by the law ― libel, defamation, true threats and incitement, to name a few ― but hate speech is not among them.  That is why earlier this summer, when white nationalist organizer Jason Kessler began securing permits for a “Unite the Right” rally, there wasn’t much that someone like Hansen could legally do to prevent it. “Was the ‘Unite the Right’ rally hate speech as most people would define it? Yes, but that didn’t get us anywhere when it came to the question of whether the city could prevent it preemptively,” Hansen explained. “That’s the most difficult thing for a government to do. There are plenty of things you can do after the fact if a speaker crosses the line. But to silence a speaker before anything comes out of his or her mouth [...] you have to meet an extraordinarily high burden and it’s almost never admissible.” Hansen said that he met with Charlottesville city officials a week before the “Unite the Right” rally took place on Aug. 11 and 12. City attorney Craig Brown confirmed that he reached out to the TJC for counsel after Kessler filed a lawsuit to move the rally from Emancipation Park to the larger McIntire Park. Brown said it’s not unusual for the city to use the TJC as a “sounding board” for First Amendment issues, as “they are experts in the field.” “First Amendment case law favors reactive, rather than proactive, remedies to offensive or even potentially dangerous expression,” Hansen clarified. “The exception to this general rule, of course, is that the government is allowed to place reasonable restrictions on the time, place and manner in which such speech may occur.” You can’t stop a person from speaking, Hansen said, but you can try to shape when, where and how loud they do it. It’s illegal, for example, to shout your opinion using a megaphone in a private neighborhood at night. So while Hansen didn’t expect the city would be able to prevent the rally completely, he hoped to work with officials in order to make the event as safe, contained and manageable as possible.  The “Unite the Right” rally ended up bleeding beyond its zoned location into multiple parks and private properties, with white supremacists passing by a synagogue and a funeral home. Tensions between neo-Nazis and the groups of counterprotesters eventually escalated, resulting in the death of 32-year-old counterprotester Heather Heyer.  “The next time this comes up we can’t have the same outcome,” Hansen said. “I think our biggest task right now is providing some kind of reasoned guidance to both cities and courts going forward. We need to figure out a better way of articulating the standards for these things.” The TJC is serious about regulating the ways that rallies like “Unite the Right” take shape moving forward, but Hansen’s organization will continue to protect their right to existence otherwise. His reasoning is practical. “If you keep these people in the dark, you lose track of them, you allow them to fester in the shadows. It’s better to keep a spotlight on them.” Hate speech out in the open, Hansen asserts, is more difficult for people to repudiate or sweep under a rug. “You start denying these people the right to speak publicly and you’re just providing evidence that things like racism and anti-Semitism aren’t problems. You let these guys come out and speak, and all of a sudden you can’t deny it. All these guys marching down the lawn chanting ‘Jews will not replace us,’ and, well, your uncle can’t claim that anti-Semitism is fake news anymore.” Prominent displays of hate speech, however, are not without their inherent dangers. The line between language that is intolerant and language that is threatening or inciting violence can be blurry. And even speech acts unaccompanied by physical violence can trigger, intimidate and terrorize certain individuals. In an opinion article for the Los Angeles Times, Northwestern University sociology professor Laura Beth Nielsen described some of hate speech’s negative consequences: “Racist hate speech has been linked to cigarette smoking, high blood pressure, anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, and requires complex coping strategies. Exposure to racial slurs also diminishes academic performance.” Even without violence, hate has its physical repercussions. But as David Straughn, a Black Lives Matter activist in Charlottesville, explained, the “Unite the Right” rally hardly qualified as nonviolent. “White people always talk about free speech and how they have a right to be heard,” Straughn said. “But during the weekend of Aug. 12, I did not see one microphone, one public amplification system or one generator. They weren’t coming for free speech. They were coming to intimidate and harm and beat and and murder Charlottesville civilians and community members, predominantly people of color. They were coming to hurt people.” Straughn is skeptical of the idea that free expression is, in reality, a right afforded to all Americans. “I think that if 1,000 members of Black Lives Matter put together a rally, the police would have been much more present. There would have been more of a pushback from elected officials. They wouldn’t have told people, like they told us [about the ‘Unite the Right’ rally], to ‘just ignore it.’” In Straughn’s view, free speech privileges whiteness. “White men were the first people to speak for this country and the last people to speak for this country. White supremacists have been protected for hundreds of years. We’re just trying to catch up. The truth of the matter is, they will always be protected.” Nielsen makes a similar argument in her piece, highlighting instances when freedom of speech has been waived to protect the powerful. It is illegal, for example, to panhandle, the logic being that asking for money is a distraction to the commuters, business owners, workers and shoppers navigating public city space. Yet catcalling or hurling a racial slur at a woman or person of color is entirely legal.  Hansen believes in the First Amendment’s ability ― and, more so, responsibility ― to protect all Americans. Yet in practice, online and off, the universal mandate can fail to sufficiently challenge the racism, sexism and classism embedded in everyday life. Has free speech truly transcended its original scope of protecting, first and foremost, white men? Perhaps not. According to critics like Neilsen, at least, insisting upon First Amendment absolutism runs the risk of further entrenching those inequities. The shadow of the “Unite the Right” rally still looms large in Charlottesville. Signs reading “Heather,” “Unite C’ville” and “If equality and diversity aren’t for you then neither are we” can be seen in storefronts across the downtown mall area. The horrific events in August left a dark imprint on the city’s morale, as well the city’s perception of free speech.  One of the ways Hansen is working to rehabilitate Charlottesville’s faith in free speech is through a public art project called the Free Speech Wall. Architects Peter O’Shea and Robert Winstead worked to mount a two-sided wall made of Buckingham slate outside of Charlottesville’s City Hall that measures about 54 feet long and 7.5 feet high. The wall operates as a massive chalkboard, which passersby are permitted to adorn with any words or images they wish.  The wall is meant to serve as a physical manifestation of the First Amendment, a demonstration of free speech in action. “Our policy has always been that we don’t censor anything that’s up there,” Hansen said.  It is habitually wiped clean every few days by TJC employees and volunteers to make room for more messages. But aside from that, representatives do not remove any expressions that might be deemed “offensive” to some. Fellow Charlottesville residents, however, can erase, and even adapt, any inappropriate or derogatory remarks they find.  “As private citizens, you are free to write whatever you want,” Hansen explained. “To us, the project isn’t only about what’s written on the wall but what’s erased from the wall. Things are often changed and co-opted by others to make it their own. It’s a real, living process.” This idea ― that the project’s power resides not only in what is visible, but also in what is erased ― extends, in Hansen’s mind, to another prevalent discussion concerning free expression today: what to do with Confederate monuments, the question that spurred the “Unite the Right” rally in the first place. The answer, Hansen explained, is complicated. First of all, many monuments are protected by local laws that prevent their removal outright. But legal regulations aside, Hansen believes that neither keeping nor removing Confederate monuments is a sufficient response. “We see this idea of memorializing things as an evolving process. It’s not about the monument itself, but rather what message is conveyed, and how that changes over time.” When discussing the statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee that incited so much controversy, Hansen claimed the removal of any statue “is equally important as a speech act as erecting it in the first place.” Instead of removing the Lee monument and leaving no trace, though, Hansen suggested that the city replace the statue with some kind of memorialization ― a rundown of the statue’s entire history, outlining why it was erected and why citizens decided it no longer represented their community. “I think that’s a better outcome than just making it disappear overnight and certainly better than it being left to the people to drag it down with ropes,” he added. Today, free expression can be a target for both progressive activists and conservative traditionalists. Some on the left see the amendment as enabling hate and bigotry, threatening those who are already marginalized and persecuted. Some on the right perceive acts of protest like kneeling during the national anthem as anti-patriotic. And perhaps most hazardous is a president who has, as Hansen put it, demonstrated “a tenuous grasp on constitutional principles, particularly when it comes to the First Amendment.” Between attacking the press and condemning protesters, President Donald Trump has exhibited, in Hansen’s words, a “very unfriendly view toward the principles of free speech and expression we are trying to uphold.” Since Trump launched his presidential campaign in 2015, the number of hate groups in the United States has increased, from 892 in 2015 to 917 in 2016. Mark Potok, senior fellow of the Southern Poverty Law Center and editor of its Intelligence Report, called 2016 “an unprecedented year for hate.” “These extremists think they finally have an ally who has the president’s ear,” he reported, referring to Steve Bannon, former White House chief strategist. This swell corresponds with a surge of hate crimes and speech acts. Just last month a video surfaced ― and quickly went viral ― showing a white man on a subway drunkenly screaming obscenities at black passengers. In between racial slurs, the man chanted, “First Amendment! First Amendment!” Hansen is often tasked with protecting these kinds of First Amendment advocates ― from people who use speech to intimidate and menace people of a different ethnicity to those who express sexual, disparaging and humiliating opinions about female co-workers. And in 2017, with hate groups emerging and growing fortified by the current administration, the First Amendment is on the receiving end of some seriously bad PR.  However, the more the American public grows dubious of the First Amendment’s exigency, the more urgent Hansen considers his line of work.  “There are real, practical reasons to defend ugly speech. It’s not easy, though, and I admire people who do it way more publicly and directly than we are able to. It takes a lot of guts and internal resolve to commit to the positive outcomes you know will emerge from this.”"
ARTS & CULTURE,Street Art Mural Of Kevin Spacey Will Soon Be Erased,"A mural of Kevin Spacey will soon vanish from the side of a building in the northwest England city of Manchester. Anonymous street artist Akse revealed via Facebook on Friday that he will replace his 2015 piece “as a result of the recent allegations” of sexual misconduct against the Oscar-winning actor. The decision to remove the mural, which shows Spacey as “House of Cards” character Frank Underwood, was made jointly with the wall’s owners, Akse added. Akse painted the mural on the building, owned by Nurhbai and Co. Accountants, in May 2015. “We love it!” the company said via Facebook on its completion: But as sexual misconduct claims mounted against Spacey, owner Hussain Nurbhai was “adamant” it be replaced, the BBC reported. Akse has not revealed when or how he will paint over the piece, which formed part of his “Psychopaths” series. HuffPost has reached out for comment. Bryan Cranston’s “Breaking Bad” character of Walter White, and Christian Bale’s character of Patrick Bateman from “American Psycho,” also are featured in Akse’s project in Manchester.

ARTS & CULTURE,Why A $450 Million Painting Attributed To Leonardo Da Vinci Worries Art Historians,"Ahead of Wednesday’s record-breaking auction at Christie’s, during which a painting attributed to Leonardo da Vinci sold for a throat-clenching $450 million, art critic Jerry Saltz voiced some doubts.  Saltz, in an essay for New York magazine, called the portrait of Christ “dead” and “inert,” suggesting that the artwork ― which had been predicted to fetch only $100 million ― is “a sham.” It’s “no Leonardo,” he wrote. Saltz, neither a historian nor an expert in old master work, went on to suggest that Christie’s sale would end poorly. “No museum on Earth can afford an iffy picture like this at these prices.” And then “Salvator Mundi (Savior of the World)” a 500-year-old portrait of Christ thought to be a copy when it was plucked from an estate sale for a measly $10,000 in 2005, sold for nearly half a billion dollars to an undisclosed private buyer. Suddenly, the controversy surrounding the painting’s authenticity ― its whereabouts over these last few centuries and whether multiple restorations had indelibly altered its surface ― became white noise. Christie’s had managed to rocket past previous auction benchmarks, brokering a historic sum for the seller, Russian billionaire Dmitry E. Rybolovlev’s family trust. Perhaps a museum lacked funds to secure the questionable picture, but a nameless member of the 1 percent surely possessed pockets deep enough. To most people, $450 million is an unimaginable sum. As Hrag Vartanian at Hyperallergic pointed out, that’s more money than the total estimated cost of the new Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City: $422 million. (It’s also reportedly more money than the Koch brothers are expecting to spend in the 2018 election cycle: $300 million to $400 million.) “This is a very small step for mankind, but a big step for the art market,” Frank Zöllner, a German art historian and professor at Universität Leipzig, who’s written a book on Leonardo, told HuffPost in a statement over email. “A heavily damaged painting by Leonardo, which was created with the substantial involvement of his workshop after 1507 or even later, achieved a record price, which is significantly higher than the sums that are called for modern masters.” “Of course, [‘Salvator’] is the symbol of a very unequal, even obscene distribution of wealth in the world,” Zöllner added. Art experts expressed concern with the $450 million price tag, well above the previous record for a painting sold at auction ― $179 million for Picasso’s “Les Femmes d’Alger,” set in 2015.  “I am deeply shocked by” the price, Stephen Campbell, an art history professor at Johns Hopkins University who focuses on Renaissance art, explained. “As a colleague said to me today, the 1 percent — who owns half the planet’s wealth — are looking for the last few places to deposit their wealth. This is a very limited, overvalued sector of the art market. ... The pricing could be controlled in such a way that a public institution could afford it. This is not a celebratory moment.” Campbell’s unease stems, in part, from the painting’s murky history, a pressure point for a portion of the scholarly community. Campbell saw “Salvator Mundi” in person six years ago. At the time, he was impressed by the lineup of experts willing to vouch for the work, as well as with the scrupulous condition report Christie’s released elucidating the painting’s entire conservation history. The report notes that X-rays and infrared reflectography revealed the signature pentimenti, or visible changes, that helped confirm the painting’s attribution. “That being said,” Campbell continued, “there is very little Leonardo visible in the painting that was seen yesterday.” Campbell estimated that only 20 percent of the painting’s surface was rendered in Leonardo’s 16th-century Italian workshop. The rest was carefully reconstructed by conservators, including Dianne Dwyer Modestini. And even that scant 20 percent is in question; there’s a possibility it was executed by Leonardo’s assistants, meticulously trained to mimic his style, and not by the old master himself. The true hand of the artist, Campbell said, is impossible to definitively discern.  “Most post-1500 [Leonardo] paintings are hybrids,” Campbell said. As a result, “when art historians say Leonardo, they’re talking about a category,” he explained. “It’s a ‘Leonardo effect.’” Campbell is not the only historian with suspicions. Art adviser Todd Levin and Sotheby’s senior international specialist Philip Hook have also expressed measured doubt about the work and its provenance. The painting that once hung in the collection of Charles I of England now appears cracked and worn, overpainted and slightly reimagined. Its whereabouts from 1763 to 1900 are unknown. It resurfaced, only to be sold in 1958 for £45 and disappear once again ― until it popped up in 2005, courtesy of art dealer Alexander Parish. Between 2013 and 2017, the then-consortium-authenticated painting sold once for over $75 million, and again for $127.5 million. “The attribution of this painting is hotly debated among Leonardo scholars and Renaissance art historians as it always happens with the discovery of new works by a major artist,” Francesca Fiorani, associate dean for the arts and humanities and professor of art history at the University of Virginia, told HuffPost. “Time will tell if the attribution of this panel to Leonardo will stick or whether in a few years the painting will look very different.” In a statement to HuffPost, a representative for Christie’s cited Luke Syson, curator of Italian paintings before 1500 and head of research at the National Gallery in London; Keith Christiansen, chair of European paintings at the Metropolitan Museum of Art; Vincent Delieuvin, ‎curator of 16th century Italian painting at the Musée du Louvre; and Martin Kemp, emeritus professor of the history of art at the University of Oxford, among others, as experts willing to endorse the work as Leonardo. Kemp reiterated his support of the attribution during a phone call with HuffPost on Thursday. “There were some self-seeking publicity people, journalists, who tried to denigrate the painting, which was so expensive ― that was so valued. But they weren’t serious objections,” Kemp said. As evidence of Leonardo’s handiwork, Kemp homed in on several aspects of the work, including the mysterious orb that appears in Christ’s hand. “It wasn’t like an ordinary sphere,” Kemp recalled of his time gazing at the painting in person. “It looked like rock crystal. ... It’s not the normal ‘Mundi’ sphere. This is the sphere of the fixed stars, of the cosmos. So Leonardo transmuted it from being a savior of the world to being a savior of the cosmos. That’s the kind of genius he was capable of.” pic.twitter.com/WrJlHVJdjH As for the sum paid to secure the “Salvator,” Kemp agreed it’s “astonishing.” But the painting, which he described as the “spiritual equivalent to ‘Mona Lisa,’” is, he said, “worth what someone’s willing to pay for it.” “The people who are paying these sums of money undoubtedly would have undertaken due research,” he added. “It is largely a restoration, and it is a damaged picture, but so are a lot of old master works. It’s not the best I’ve ever seen, and it’s not the worst.” At the end of the day, Campbell concluded that the doubt surrounding the alleged Leonardo doesn’t matter, because, for all practical purposes, the attribution of the artwork was confirmed by the Christie’s sale. “As a colleague of mine said, ‘Nothing makes a Leonardo more than a hundred- million-dollar price tag,’” Campbell said. “The valuation works in reverse to justify the attribution.” Ultimately, Campbell said that he could accept the painting as a Leonardo, but he could not reconcile with its price. “It’s become a trophy, a market fetish. It’s being taken away from the interest of scholars,” he said. Lynn Catterson, a part-time lecturer at Columbia University who specializes in the Renaissance, the historical art market and 19th-century Florence, similarly described the painting’s value as “ridiculous and endemic to a planet whose economic disparities are worse than severe. And that is leaving aside issues of authenticity and provenance.” As Tim Schneider wrote for Artnet News, Christie’s revised fee structure saddles buyers capable of purchasing works over $4 million with a 12.5-percent premium, which ultimately carried the final $400 million bid for “Salvator” to a total payout closer to the half-billion mark. For cultural institutions with limited budgets, the premium allows private buyers to outbid them at auction, leaving cultural touchstones in the hands of the ultra-rich. This year’s Global Wealth Report, published on Tuesday, confirmed that 1 percent of the world’s population owns half the world’s total household wealth. Just as money has the power to shape democracy, so does it threaten to rewrite art history. If a seismic price tag becomes a more powerful indicator of masterworks than scholarly consensus, provenance and authentication, the sale sets a frightening precedent for, as Saltz put it, #FakeArtNews. “Most people do not seem to realize that an attribution is an opinion and, as such, legally is not binding,” Maurizio Seracini, an art diagnostician who’s worked extensively with Leonardo’s work, said. “Nevertheless, investors are purchasing art at incredible prices based just on opinions! No wonder why the production of fakes is booming internationally!” A $450 million valuation is then, by most accounts, unbelievable. However, if any artist could posthumously pull it off, Leonardo might be the most probable candidate.  “On one level, a staggering figure in the art market reminds me of global financial disparity,” Bronwen Wilson, a professor of Renaissance and early modern art at UCLA, said. “But I also find myself ruminating on Dan Brown, video games and lineups to see Leonardo’s works ― for the ‘Mona Lisa,’ ‘The Last Supper,’ and exhibitions ― which is to say that there is also something about Leonardo’s particular purchase on the cultural imagination that plays a role in this instance.” The cult of Leonardo extends far and wide. He’s become the mythical manifestation of interdisciplinary genius, a superhuman amalgamation of artistic talent, scientific acumen and unbridled curiosity. And there is still another Leonardo work in private hands: “The Madonna of the Yarnwinder.” As Campbell mentioned, it will be interesting to see what happens if and when this final masterpiece hits the auction block. Perhaps “Madonna” won’t match the hefty price tag of “Salvator,” suggesting soaring auction prices have reached their tipping point. However, if values continue to inflate, the art market’s steel bubble will continue to serve as a glorified piggy bank for the 1 percent.

ARTS & CULTURE,'Lost' Leonardo Da Vinci Sells For Record $450 Million At Auction,"Leonardo da Vinci has shattered expectations yet again with the sale of one of his paintings Wednesday. Da Vinci’s long-lost “Salvator Mundi” (“Savior of the World”) sold for a record-breaking $450.3 million at auction at Christie’s in New York City. The painting shows Jesus holding a small orb in his hand, symbolizing the world, and is one of the few surviving pieces of da Vinci’s work.  The Renaissance artwork was thought to be lost for centuries, disappearing from the collection of King Charles I of England in 1736. Charles Robinson purchased the painting in London in 1900, but the piece was no longer credited to da Vinci at that point, according to the auction house.  Leonardo da Vinci's masterpiece Salvator Mundi achieves $450,312,500, a #worldauctionrecord for any work of art sold at auction. pic.twitter.com/snKxm7t3cb “Salvator Mundi” went through more unwitting owners before being discovered in Louisiana in 2005 by New York art collector Robert Simon. Christie’s auction house billed the painting as “The Last Da Vinci.” “Salvator Mundi” was authenticated after years of restoration and research that began in 2007.  The small artwork has gained international attention with BuzzFeed News even live-streaming the auction on Wednesday to thousands of viewers.  Da Vinci’s painting well surpassed the $100 million expected price, as the sale ended up being worth just over $450 million after including fees. The sale is a record, according to The Guardian. "
ARTS & CULTURE,How 'Daddy' Puts The Blame For Toxic Masculinity On Spoiled Teenage Girls,"On Sunday’s season finale of “Last Week Tonight,” comedian John Oliver took a shot at one of his most acclaimed peers. Referencing a New York Times report on Louis C.K.’s “gross sexual misconduct,” Oliver noted that the revelation “inevitably resulted in the cancellation of his new film, ‘Exhibit A if This Ever Goes to Trial.’” Louis C.K.’s film, actually titled “I Love You, Daddy,” was on the verge of release when the reports of misconduct emerged. If it were any old project, it likely would have been dropped in the face of these allegations ― and it was ― but it can’t be denied that Louis C.K. did his work no favors by giving it an almost ludicrously creepy project title. It reads like fiction, like parody, like he was mocking his own grotesque narrative in advance, so that we needn’t bother. There’s something icky about the title, so much so that it seems like a blatant provocation now. It’s coy ― the sexual undertones are undeniable in this era, but there’s also a level of plausible deniability: What’s wrong with a daughter loving her dad? Louis C.K.’s choice of title was clearly deliberate, and the content of the movie is just as unsettling as the title. The narrative centers on industry hack Glen Topher, played by Louis C.K., who bats aside the rumors of abuse and child molestation surrounding his favorite filmmaker until that same filmmaker begins to put the moves on his adored and adoring 17-year-old daughter, China.  China (Chloë Grace Moretz) is ostensibly the motivating force of the movie, but she is not a fleshed-out, substantial character. She’s a visually pleasing trope, and a learning tool for her father, who has to grapple with female sexual agency, his duties as a parent and his moral blindness to abusive great men. China’s sexual awakening is viewed through the eyes of the older male characters, especially her father; what we see is only the effect her maturation has on them. But the title is in China’s voice, and that is perhaps the really unsettling thing about it. She’s given enough of a voice to flirt, enough of a voice to flatter and disarm. She’s the one who says “I love you, Daddy” (nearly every line of hers begins or ends with this blandishment) and thus weaves a spell of pleasant oblivion over her father. He’s happy to accept her kisses and snuggles rather than actually raise her. “A girl that age is getting into trouble,” says an ex-girlfriend played by Pamela Adlon to Glen, correctly, “and if she loves her daddy that means you’re doing nothing.” Part of the unease of hearing a nubile 17-year-old cozy up to her “daddy” is, of course, that the term has been thoroughly sexualized. That’s not new per se ― it’s been an endearment for a male sexual partner for many years, especially in kink and queer communities. But what was once siloed or glossed over is now pervasive. In 2016, amid the Republican primary, poet Patricia Lockwood tweeted “fuck me daddy” at Donald Trump during a takeover of The New Republic’s Twitter. In 2015, Pope Francis could barely tweet without being deluged with graphic responses: “fuck me daddy,” “choke me daddy,” and infinite variations. Broadly interviewed some of the young people who tweeted these things at the pope, and, unsurprisingly, found most of them were trolling for reactions. Regardless, if you follow His Holiness on Twitter, you’ve probably seen “daddy” used in a less-than-wholesome context. The most unsettling part of this framing, though, is that “daddy” doesn’t just capture the sexualization of male power and female infantilization, but the extent to which the culpability for that is put onto girls. “Daddy” doesn’t connote any particular type of dad, necessarily ― instead, it tends to characterize the speaker, a certain genus of spoiled post-pubescent daughter who performs an exaggerated version of dependence and youthfulness in service of her own ends. In an important way, this framing is specific to fathers and daughters. Oftentimes we don’t see men as having power until they are daddies, kings of their own domestic realms. Young boys who need to be fed and sheltered by their parents are children, not wielders of influence; using your gap-toothed grin to charm your mom or dad into getting you a video game is nothing compared to the ability a boy will one day have to provide for himself ― no flattery or performed affection necessary. But the way we view the power of young girls is warped by the fact that, even as adults, we expect women to achieve financial and personal influence through men. A daughter’s ability to wrap her daddy around her little finger long seemed like the apex of female power: The patriarch of the family is under her sway. In “I Love You, Daddy,” China lounges in bikinis and curls up next to her dad on the couch as she wheedles him into sending her to Florida to party with her friends. “With the exception of Ivanka Trump,” writes The New Yorker’s Alexandra Schwartz, “I have never known a teen-age girl to spend so much time on her daddy’s lap.” She acts more like a trophy girlfriend than a teenage daughter ― she opens conversations with a syrupy “How are you, daddy?” and flirtatiously tilts her dainty chin at him, just before suggesting he let her skip school and use his shared jet to return to spring break. Glen tries feebly to tell her that she should stand on her own two feet, get a job, but the film seems invested in the idea that his attempts at parenting are doomed by her cunning performance of childish helplessness. But if a teenage girl is sitting on her dad’s lap to earn treats and favors from him, we can only conclude that he has long incentivized that behavior. Typically, of course, this has to do with access to money. For a long time, a father’s primary, if not sole, role in a nuclear family was to work outside the home and bring in money for everyone else to live on, while the mother’s role was, ideally, to care for the household and children. Some women have always worked outside the home ― usually poor and lower-middle-class women who were driven to work out of economic necessity. Success, for a woman, has, in tandem, been defined as marrying a rich man and living comfortably without working; being the beloved daughter of a rich man means similar access to his resources. An adolescent girl sweetly asking her pop to let her go shopping at the mall is just a precursor to an adult woman coaxing her husband into upgrading her car. Are these retrograde notions of female roles? Yes, but powerful ones that have been difficult to completely dislodge ― partly because they’re baked into cherished works of art and entertainment, from Lolita to “Clueless.” (Cher was a smart girl, but it’s not hard to imagine that her relationship with her father ― and his credit cards ― would have been painted much differently if she were a he.) Even into the 21st century, a T-shirt or license plate that flaunts the phrase “daddy’s girl” connotes the privilege of being lovable enough to have a benefactor. Ivanka Trump, a businesswoman in her own right, wields an influence over her father that was best captured by her request to join a presidential trip: “She said ‘Daddy, can I go with you?’” Donald Trump told a crowd during the trip. “I like that. I said, ‘Yes, you can.’” In this weird little scenario, only by flattering the ego of her more powerful father could Ivanka get something she wanted: a trip to North Dakota. (If this is the quality of influence Ivanka has over the president, it’s little wonder that it’s resulted in her face cropping up on international junkets and at high-level meetings, rather than in a moderation of his policies.) The incursion of women into the workplace has, if anything, increased the stigma of girls behaving in this way (hey, they’re able to succeed without cozying up to men these days) without changing the base assumption that women are fundamentally willing to exchange sex or affection to get crumbs of power or money from male gatekeepers (but they choose to, those manipulative tarts). Harvey Weinstein’s alleged serial predation remained nothing but an industry open secret for years, in large part, thanks to the assumption that the starlets he pursued were willingly and affirmatively making the choice to have sex with him for career advancement. And that, in society’s eyes, would be on them.  Our suspicion of ambitious women is so great that we side-eye them for, we assume, playing the game, far more so than the male gatekeepers who make the rules. It’s 17-year-old China, not her daddy or her much-older love interest, who truly needs to change her ways. Oddly enough, even Glen’s vaunted attempts at parenting his daughter are actually exercises of this kind of undermining. When she responds to an erotic slasher they’re watching with some nascent feminism (men, she says, have “fucked us for long enough. Now it’s time to fuck them”), he doesn’t engage with her ideas. Instead, he snorts with laughter and shames her, a high school student, for living off of her wealthy father instead of getting a waitressing job. In the climactic blow-up between Glen and China, newly 18, she alternately protests that she’s an adult now and can make her own choices, and that she’s in high school and needs support. Glen responds, basically, that she can’t have it both ways. But he’s the one who has wanted to have it both ways, letting her make her own decisions like an adult so that she will keep loving him with the unreserved affection of a child. With conflict comes the blessed disappearance of “Daddy” from the film’s dialogue. In one horrifying moment, when China walks in on her father asking filmmaker Leslie Goodwin if he is fucking his daughter, she shouts at him in disgust ― and she calls him “Dad.” That he, soon after, has her move out on her own says something still more unsettling about what behavior he needs from a daughter in order to support her. “I Love You, Daddy” traces a necessary arc, with China assuming a healthier distance from her father, but the lessons that remain do little to disturb the “daddy” paradigm. Glen is ultimately a sad sort of hero, a man who did what he needed to do for the daughter he loved. Leslie, in a disturbing way, is also a hero. Instead of having a sexual relationship with China, he’s painted as a sort of unthreatening “pervert” who enjoys watching a young girl shop for shorts at Barneys, yes, but who rewards her with a highly educational trip to Paris and provides necessary friction with her father that launches her into adulthood. During a postcoital argument with Rose Byrne’s character, in which Louis C.K. has Byrne voice a rigorous defense of old men sleeping with teenage girls, she argues that a relationship with Leslie might be just the thing to “grow China up.” The movie winds up cosigning this argument, though to do so it lets Leslie off the hook on a technicality.  “I Love You, Daddy” is the silver-screen embodiment of what makes “daddy” feel so creepy in 2017. Men remain the gatekeepers to money and life experience, but we still see girls and young women as the ones with the power ― the power to cajole and seduce it from their daddies and their boyfriends. The solution, apparently, is for women simply to stop doing this, to stop trying to exploit and compromise the men around them. The most depressing part of this cultural narrative, of course, is how little control women actually have over it. We have long been incentivized and expected to perform, like China, a sort of alluring childlikeness that soothes the egos and tickles the libidos of powerful men. Our society celebrates that murky melding of woman and girl: Old enough to sexualize, but young enough not to know better. We want women to behave nearly the same way as daughters and lovers ― deferential, attentive, admiring and dependent.  No wonder the word “daddy,” voiced by a teenage girl, makes us squirm. It should."
ARTS & CULTURE,Kehinde Wiley Was Destined To Paint Barack Obama,"The presidential portraits wing of the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery is lined with paintings of very powerful and equally pasty men. Its walls, filled with bowties, powder wigs and pursed lips, speak two well-known truths at once: Both the history of American politics and the history of Western art are blindingly white.  In 2018, however, the gallery will receive an addition unlike the rest. As was reported earlier this fall, a portrait of former President Barack Obama will join the Smithsonian ranks next year, painted by 40-year-old contemporary art star Kehinde Wiley. As a result, Obama will become the first black president featured in the gallery, and Wiley (along with Amy Sherald, commissioned to paint Michelle Obama), the first black artist to grace its halls. The former president and first lady hand-picked the artists who will render their official portraits. And those decisions hold weight. Antwaun Sargent, a 29-year-old critic who’s covered Wiley extensively, felt personally affected by Obama’s historic choice. “I grew up in Chicago,” he told HuffPost. “I knocked on doors in the dead of winter when Obama was running for Senate. To see him choose an openly queer, black man who has devoted his career to depicting black folks, it’s really full circle for me.”  Wiley’s paintings are easy to discern. Their backgrounds typically involve a florid design quietly creeping toward the fore, its composition a melting pot of British Arts and Crafts textiles and Dutch-made African wax prints. Up front is usually a figure ― young, attractive and black ― dressed in contemporary streetwear and mimicking the stances of Old Master heroes like Napoleon Bonaparte or Charles V.  Wiley’s painted subjects are often categorized as “normal,” in that they’re not particularly rich or famous, as portrait sitters for Titian or Jacques-Louis David tended to be. Wiley scouts his subjects himself, either on the streets of New York or through open casting calls. Like many artists, Wiley has an appreciation for beauty, but he gravitates toward a lesser documented masculine allure that manifests in hip style, performative swagger, defined muscles, tattoos and radiant black skin. “Sometimes I’d walk through the galleries just to look at the way the faces and the hands are painted, all the nuances of black,” Eugenie Tsai, the Brooklyn Museum curator who organized a 2015 exhibition of Wiley’s work, recalled. Once immortalized in Wiley’s massive, gold-framed canvases (they can measure as large as nine feet tall), his subjects shift from regular people to mythic giants. They ride horses like Napoleon, wield swords like Willem van Heythuysen and pose flamboyantly like Andries Stilte II, all while wearing standard blue jeans and sneakers. Wiley imbues his sitters with a gravitas and glory historically reserved for patrons, nobles and saints. His works build upon the centuries-old relationship between portraiture and power, using the canonized language of art history to exalt a new kind of subject.  “He literally is the first person I know of, throughout the history of painting, who is appropriating the entire history of art ― from cave painting on ― and bending it to his will,” Sean Kelly, founder of Sean Kelly Gallery, the gallery that represents Wiley’s work, said. “The whole history of art becomes a narrative about black presence.” Conversations about Wiley’s work often revolve around this one specific aspect: the idea of injecting brown bodies into an all-white canon. As the artist’s straightforward and affecting statement reads: “Painting is about the world that we live in. Black men live in the world. My choice is to include them. This is my way of saying yes to us.” However, Wiley’s paintings are not simply exercises in corrective representation ― making the invisible visible. They are intended to probe the mechanics of seeing and being seen.  “Many people see my early work simply as portraits of black and brown people,” Wiley told HuffPost in May. “Really, it’s an investigation of how we see those people and how they have been perceived over time. The performance of black American identity feels very different from actually living in a black body. There’s a dissonance between inside and outside.” Sargent described a similar dissonance between a white mainstream perception of Wiley’s subjects and his subjects’ understandings of themselves. “Kehinde saw something in these people that the larger culture didn’t see,” he said. “He believed they were heroic, that they had power. He painted people the way they imagined themselves, the way society has always ignored.” If conventional Western portraits calcify structural power, Wiley’s are vehicles for empowerment in and of themselves. They exist in the discordant space between assumption, reality and performance, where the self is as wrapped up in artifice as authenticity. There is, therefore, a parallel between how Wiley regards his subjects and how Obama, as a young man, imagined himself. To fête an unlikely subject is “not unlike a black man saying ‘I’m going to run for president’ when everyone is saying ‘no you can’t,’” Sargent said.  For Tsai, another overlooked element of Wiley’s work is its queerness. Female beauty has remained a near constant source of inspiration for Western artists, but appreciation of male beauty, especially black male beauty by a black male artist, can still bring a jolt to the system. “Instead of the male gaze ― men looking at women ― you have a sense that this is a man looking at men,” she said. “It’s no secret.” Portraying his subjects with exuberance and a hint of kitsch, Wiley embraces queerness as a lens, challenging the shallow assumptions that often beset young black men. “Wiley doesn’t only challenge the white gaze, but also the cultural gaze and the role of masculinity,” Sargent said. “It’s about black men trying to negotiate gayness in the context of mainstream gay society which has its prejudices. ’If I don’t look this way, or if I don’t act this way, am I gay? Am I black? Can you still see me?’” There is more to Wiley’s work than the goal of diversifying subjects and artists represented in the art world. Yet that initiative ― also undertaken by artists including Kerry James Marshall, the late Barkley Hendricks, Mickalene Thomas, as well as rising artists like Jordan Casteel, Henry Taylor, Njideka Akunyili-Crosby, Toyin Ojih Odutola and many more ― has tangible effects.  The Brooklyn Museum’s 2015 mid-career survey of Wiley’s work was wildly popular, drawing around 124,000 visitors over the course of three months. More than the numbers, curator Tsai was struck by the wide range of people entering the museum’s doors: art buffs and kids walking down Eastern Parkway, hip-hop aficionados and local families.  “For me, one of the most amazing things about the exhibition was eavesdropping on the conversations going on,” Tsai said. “It made me realize that everyone should have the experience of seeing someone who looks like you hanging on the walls of a cultural institution. You think of an exhibition as the work on the walls, but the interactions between the visitors and the works of art were crucial.”  Beyond expanding the scope of museum attendees, Wiley is also helping shape the next generation of collectors. “In the short term, he’s bringing a different audience to the work,” gallerist Kelly put it. “In the long term, he’s broadening the depth of collectors for the work. Kehinde’s work is capable of touching different audiences in different ways, so the collector base is much more diverse.” Kelly speculated that these real-world effects drive Wiley as an artist. “I think after 4,000 years of being excluded from the narrative, he wants to make sure that the next generation of kids walking into a museum don’t have to experience what he did. I think he wants everybody to feel like what they’re looking at represents them and in some way speaks to them.” Wiley grew up in South Central, Los Angeles, with five siblings ― including a twin brother ― and his mother, who worked as a linguist before opening a junk shop in the neighborhood. Wiley was influenced by his mother’s linguistic work, which explored the friction between American Standard English and the black vernacular and code-switching black kids adopt as a method of survival.  As an adult, cast in the role of “contemporary black artist,” Wiley is cognizant of the multiple worlds he inhabits and the distinct languages each requires. “It’s about being able to play inside and outside of the race narrative at once,” the San Francisco Art Institute and Yale University School of Art alumnus said. “It’s difficult to get right.” In a 2017 series, Wiley painted prominent black artists as “Tricksters,” fabled master code-switchers, to illustrate their dexterity in mythic terms. Rashid Johnson, an artist featured in the series and a friend of Wiley’s since 2001, described the experience of sitting for Wiley as very organized and comfortable. “I don’t think he changes personalities but he takes on a more directorial position,” he told HuffPost. “It’s Kehinde but a little more serious.” Outside the studio, Wiley’s peers describe him as brilliant, energetic and incredibly present. “He’s one of those people who walks into the room and the temperature changes,” Kelly said.  Wiley currently has two running studios ― one in Brooklyn, one in Beijing ― and is building a third in Senegal. The spaces operate like the traditional Renaissance studios of Leonardo or Michelangelo catapulted into a postmodern, 21st-century laboratory, with assistants ushering his large-scale ideas into being. The conceptual work is Wiley’s alone, but the task of painting is divvied up among a number of assistants who’ve mastered his stroke.  This studio setup, despite its significant art historical precedent, interrupts the persistent fantasy of the monogamous relationship between artist and artwork. As Wiley explained to GQ’s Wyatt Mason: “The sentiments about authenticity in the public eye, the discomfort with a large-scale art practice, comes from a myth in an artistic process that never existed.” Wiley romanticizes neither the creation of art nor its valuation. “Wiley acknowledges that he makes high-end products to sell,” Tsai said. “It’s partially tongue in cheek, but it’s part of his practice.” The understanding that art is not something precious and invaluable, but in fact, something very valuable, frees Wiley up to exhibit his work outside the typical art world-approved venues. In 2009, Wiley partnered with Puma on a collection of clothing, shoes and accessories incorporating the graphic patterns from his paintings’ backdrops. His work also appears on the set of Fox drama “Empire,” in the gilded apartment of Terrence Howard’s character Lucious Lyon.  “We wanted the character to be like a Jay-Z,” set decorator Caroline Perzan said. “So the question was: what would Jay-Z have at his penthouse in New York?” Wiley’s portraits ― flashy, epic, instantly recognizable and widely coveted ― were a perfect choice. Because the selected paintings, including “Officer of the Hussars,” were either hanging in museums or otherwise occupied, Perzan bought the rights to the images, then printed them onto high-quality canvases and framed them.  Some star painters might turn their noses up at the thought of their work appearing on the set of a soapy TV show, but Wiley consistently shows how arbitrary and confining the art world’s conventions can be. “I think Kehinde has been really smart about making sure his work has multiple audiences and [isn’t] just locked away in castles and museums where all people don’t have access to it,” Sargent said. “I think that is part of the genius of Kehinde Wiley.” Kelly agreed, recognizing Wiley’s willingness to stir up categories both in his work and with his work. “He is part of a younger generation of artists who are very comfortable moving between high and low culture and across cultural boundaries,” he said. “Take ‘Napoleon Leading the Army over the Alps,’ which has a contemporary kid called Napoleon on a horse in a pair of Puma shoes and a hoodie. Kehinde is prepared to cross all those boundaries and deal with all of those high art transgressions.” Obama’s official portrait, which won’t be revealed until early 2018, will likely not adhere to Wiley’s famed formula. Many of his critics and peers predict it will not feature a vibrant, textile backdrop nor a horse-riding Obama clad with sword or cane. But perhaps more important, Wiley need not adorn Obama with the traditional trappings of privilege and power to help white society grasp the authority he possesses. Obama has already transformed the way white America envisions mastery. In fact, when Obama ran for president in 2008, his image was already iconic, thanks to a ubiquitous stencil portrait by street artist Shepard Fairey. The portrait featured the candidate’s stylized face in patriotic colors, with the word “hope” written underneath.  Fairey’s portrait may have defined Obama’s candidacy, but Wiley’s will define his presidency. The pairing is as bold as it is fitting: a young art star in conversation with the entire history of Western art, embracing its norms while broadening its scope. With profound self-awareness, Obama aligns himself with Wiley’s mission of entering a historically white sphere and mastering it as the world takes notice. Nearly a year after a new president was elected, Obama reminds his followers of how he sees himself and how history will remember him.  Wiley has described his artistic practice as a “way of saying yes to us” ― the black community, the queer community, all the individuals who aren’t typically memorialized in golden frames. The sentiment echoes Obama’s lyrical motto, “yes we can,” which followed him from his senate campaign in 2004 to his final speech as president in 2017. With his official presidential portrait, Obama manages to convey this message even without words, exuding the radical optimism that he hopes will define his legacy: Yes we can. Yes we did. Yes to us. Yes.  CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated Wiley’s age as 44."
ARTS & CULTURE,'Now More Than Ever' And The Distracting Urgency Of Our Words,"On Nov. 2, New York Times columnist and noted husband of his former research assistant David Brooks graced the American reading public with his musings on the current wave of public sexual harassment allegations. Brooks’ column was quickly mocked across social media, especially his choice to dub sex “a golden nugget” and his normcore take on arousing pop songs. But what’s really odd and befuddling about his take was this blithe lede: “The world seems full of sexual predators these days.” Brooks doesn’t explain the basis for implying that there are more sexual predators today than before (in fact, even the recent accusations against film producer Harvey Weinstein and several other high-profile men span many decades), or for later asserting that the line between men seeking sexual pleasure and men preying on unwilling women is “blurrier” now than in the past. Presumably sexual harassment was easy for Brooks to ignore before the news cycle became saturated with it. In this, Brooks fell prey to the sort of ahistoricism that certainly isn’t new, but which has felt intrusively ubiquitous during this painful, exhausting year. Everything is worse than it has ever been; we have never needed salvation more than we do now. America’s standing in the world, political divisions, race relations, treatment of women ― evidence notwithstanding, mainstream discussions often take for granted that these things have never been at a lower ebb. Perhaps the most representative phrase for a year in opposing Trump is, fittingly, “Now more than ever.” Over the past 12 months, the media, institutions and public figures have worn the phrase out, leaving “now more than ever” a brittle husk, a cliché that conjures an eye roll rather than a sense of urgency.  After the election of President Donald Trump, we needed the arts now more than ever; we needed a free press now more than ever; we needed comedy now more than ever; we needed political dialogue now more than ever. Each individual cause or pursuit that seemed distasteful or trivial in the new state of political panic had to be defended, and each time the defense was the same: The very environment that makes this seem unimportant is the reason that it’s important.  By March, The Washington Post declared that “now more than ever” had to go. Of course, since then, we’ve found that we need robust missile defense, immigrant workers and young people voting in local elections ― now, more than ever. “Now more than ever” leverages the weight of history while simultaneously turning away from it. To say that we have never been in such dire straits is a powerful statement because history is long and full of dire straits ― plagues, genocides, wars ― and yet now is somehow worse. But that assertion only holds up as long as one doesn’t actually look back on those plagues, genocides and wars. We can say that America is in the lowest place we can remember, but it likely requires us to forget or downplay events in our own lifetimes, from the Jim Crow era to the September 11 attacks. We can imagine that sexual harassment is a new problem, but that requires us to ignore the Anita Hill hearings, the accusations against Bill Clinton and, frankly, the entire history of men having power over women. This attitude is somehow both nerve-jangling and soothing. It’s like declaring bankruptcy: A painful road lies ahead, but you have permission to forget about any embarrassingly awful turns you made to arrive here. Shocked Trump was elected? Surprised about the sexual harassment faced by all your female colleagues? Blindsided by the rise of the white nationalist movement? Don’t waste time grappling with the fact that you didn’t bother to vote, or sat silently when your male coworkers made sexist jokes, or ignored the targeted aggression faced by black women online in recent years. Focus on the particularly fierce urgency of now.   Both Trump’s slogan, “Make America Great Again,” and the rallying retort from his opponents, “America Is Already Great,” traffic in this sort of convenient amnesia: Either way, America starts from a base point of greatness. Either way, its ugly roots in mass genocide, human trafficking and forced labor have been swept aside. The winners write the history books, and in America the winners have always been white men. Even when human rights for the oppressed have triumphed, powerful white men on both sides have been motivated to minimize the past injustices and to glorify their own roles. Many of the narratives now accepted as common wisdom were composed with a power-consolidating agenda. These narratives demonize or ignore people of color; they sow distrust of women’s words.   With the racist backlash to the election of President Barack Obama, followed by the election of Trump, who has used rhetoric favored by white nationalists, white Americans have been confronted with a racial divide in the country that our national mythologists had been working for centuries to paper over. It seems worse now than ever; it’s not. Before, though, the suffering of people of color, and especially black people, was submerged beneath our self-congratulatory national narratives. Men have been similarly blindsided by the recent wave of sexual assault and harassment allegations against industry leaders ― or, at least, blindsided that anyone cares. Brooks isn’t the only one to wax astonished at this new wave of sexual misconduct. But the crimes existed before this month, and the perpetrators were enabled and protected by willful ignorance and anti-feminist cultural narratives.  “This tsunami of stories doesn’t just reveal the way that men have grabbed and rubbed and punished and shamed women; it shows us that they did it all while building the very world in which we still have to live,” wrote Rebecca Traister last month. She noted, in particular, the spate of sexual harassment allegations against political reporter Mark Halperin ― a man whose book, Game Change, largely defined the narrative of the 2008 election.  “The same power that afforded Halperin the ability to allegedly rub up against younger colleagues,” wrote Traister, “also meant that he got to shape the nation’s view of a woman whose political story had already been shaped by other men who abused their power.” His take on Hillary Clinton, she pointed out, was a harsh, nuance-free portrait of “a grasping and scandal-plagued woman.” His coverage of Trump, in the 2016 election, was relatively flattering. He downplayed sexual harassment claims against Trump; now the public has learned that Halperin behaved similarly with younger female colleagues. Halperin’s power to shape political narratives has taken a severe hit. A planned book on Trump’s campaign was scuttled by Penguin following the allegations, and HBO dropped a planned movie based on the book. But, as Traister notes, we still have to live with the narratives he propagated. Consider the 2016 Democratic primary. Even as the party is undoubtedly divided and in disarray, postmortems are met with annoyance and outrage from whichever group was satisfied with existing narratives. When Bernie Sanders supporters spent the weeks after the election chorusing, “Bernie would have won,” centrist Democrats were dismissive. When Clinton came out with a book about her 2016 campaign, critics across the political spectrum sniped that she needed to go away and be quiet rather than pick at the party’s wounds. This is framed as a call to “move on” or to “look ahead,” and can be directed at anyone, on any side of the divide, who wants to re-litigate an aspect of the primary. But perpetually looking ahead, or ― still worse ― looking only at the present moment, only ensures that we will continue to live with damagingly false ideas about our past.  And, as William Faulkner wrote, the past is never past. We continue to live within societies and institutions shaped by what has happened to us. In 2014, Ta-Nehisi Coates published a powerful case for reparations in The Atlantic. “Won’t reparations divide us?” he wrote. “Not any more than we are already divided. The wealth gap merely puts a number on something we feel but cannot say ― that American prosperity was ill-gotten and selective in its distribution. What is needed is an airing of family secrets, a settling with old ghosts.” Until we fully reckon with the crimes of America’s history, and reconstruct a national identity that incorporates a full understanding of them, he argues, those crimes continue to reverberate throughout our society.  “Now more than ever” and its attendant naïf posture about the longstanding ills of American culture and politics are paper over the cracks in our foundations. They’re stories we tell ourselves to explain away the damage we’ve found as a surface flaw. But fixing our country requires more than excuses and misdirection. Now, as ever, it requires us to look fearlessly into our past and be honest about what we see there."
ARTS & CULTURE,'We’re As Hidden As Our Clitorises': How Nancy Friday Liberated Women's Sexuality,"I was at a sleepover and up past midnight, itself a transgression, when my friend ― a whole year older than me and thus infinitely wiser ― pulled a book off the highest shelf: My Secret Garden: Women’s Sexual Fantasies by Nancy Friday.  She flipped to her favorite passage and read aloud in a manic whisper, parroting a woman called Wanda describing her sexual fantasy of accidentally stumbling upon a farmhouse orgy and being penetrated by a donkey as punishment. Her description was detailed and, to my elementary school ears, absolutely stupefying. I felt a lump in my stomach and a tug somewhere else.  “Did you read a book about sex last night?” my mom asked the following evening, surely, I realize now, more amused than distressed. I, terrified, denied the deed and promptly buried the visual of the donkey tryst where I hoped I would never find it. Until recently, that is, when I learned of the death of the woman who brought that particular fantasy to print. Nancy Friday died on November 5, at 84 years old, due to complications from Alzheimer’s disease. She leaves behind a contemporary world somewhat removed from the one she inhabited in 1973, when My Secret Garden was first released and the notion of women possessing sexual fantasies was, to most men, unfathomable.  “How could it be, you might ask, that women today, at the turn of the century, would still think they were the only Bad Girls with erotic thoughts?” Friday wrote in her book’s introduction. “What kind of prison is this that women impose on themselves?” Convinced that sexual agency was crucial to the fight for gender equality, Friday set out to pierce the veil of silence shrouding women’s sexual imaginations, put in place, in part, by men who were threatened by them. She compiled an anonymous compendium of women’s fantasies, from the tepid to the obscene to the delightfully bizarre. Doctor-patient fantasies, puppy play, lengthy cucumbers and big, faceless men factor into some of the more salacious scenarios, submitted to Friday via letters, in-person conversations and recorded voice calls.  Friday became interested in female fantasies after she revealed one (involving a well endowed stranger at a football game) to a lover in bed, who promptly put on his pants and exited the premises in response. The baffling encounter revealed to Friday just how great a threat women’s unsatisfied sexual potential posed to some men.  “I can see that I was only too happily enacting his indirectly stated Pygmalion-D. H. Lawrence fantasies,” she wrote. “But mine? He didn’t want to hear about them. I was not to coauthor this fascinating script on How To Be Nancy, even if it was my life. I was not to act, but to be acted upon.” My Secret Garden is an early manifestation of confessional writing, and reads almost like a proto-Tumblr or Reddit thread, with contributors sharing intimate secrets under a cloak of anonymity. Some fantasies incorporate well-trodden taboos like incest and rape, while others veer further into the surreal ― like a woman who yearns to be tantalized by an octopus from a Salvador Dali drawing.  Friday was born in 1933 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and attended an all-women’s prep school before graduating from Wellesley College. She worked as a travel reporter, editor and public relations representative soon after. My Secret Garden was her first book and became an instant best-seller, rebuffing the myth that women were somehow less sexually curious, inventive or deviant than men. Two years after its debut, Friday published a sequel titled Forbidden Flowers: More Women’s Sexual Fantasies, and went on to publish six more books focusing on the relationship between women, identity and sexuality.  My Secret Garden, which was adapted into a play in 2009 and inspired sex writer Emily Dubberley to repeat the project 40 years later with the book Garden of Desires: The Evolution of Women’s Sexual Fantasies, remains Friday’s most well-known book. In one of my favorite passages, a woman called Esther expresses not a particular fantasy but a more general way of being alone, transforming mundane reality into a playground of sexual potential. I daydream a lot, which probably accounts for the fact that I enjoy sex so often. I do my housework in the tops of baby-doll pajamas, stay in a half-hot mood most of the time, what with touching myself, or rubbing against various objects. The nozzle of the vacuum cleaner hose, for instance, played lightly over the pubic area is terrific and will bring on an orgasm if desired. Sometimes I wear a dildo inserted while doing housework. I imagine it to be my boxer dog’s prick. Many of the submissions are book-ended by disclaimers and apologies ― “I’ve never told anyone” and “Please excuse me,” verbal tics that illuminate the culture of silence and shame that Friday hoped to retire. “We’re as hidden as our clitorises,” she wrote. “By the time we’ve found them, hidden away up there, we’re guilty at having located them.” Through the act of digging up and fleshing out, documenting and sharing, Friday’s contributors begin to realize that the desires are not the problem, the culture that condemns them is. I had a similar realization, years after initially encountering Friday’s book in a dimly lit living room, when I, a student, submitted a proposal to write the weekly sex column for University of California, Berkeley’s newspaper. For my trial piece I revisited my earliest sexual fantasy, which involved the big, bad wolf from the fable of “Three Little Pigs.” It felt electric to uncover a memory I once hoped would never reach the light of day and share it with strangers, without apology. I could perfectly recall the illustration of the wolf that first sparked the strange feeling and the random, soft objects in my bedroom I used to stoke it.  With that story, I got the gig and immediately felt a surge of regret and fear. Writing cheekily about my hot and heavy childhood memories was one thing, but writing about my current desires and exploits was another entirely. The fact that my grandparents promised to read every newspaper issue added an additional layer of dread. I managed to go the entire semester without once divulging anything personal. Instead, I used generous friends’ anecdotes and observations. When summer finally came, I was as relieved as I was disappointed in myself.  I didn’t realize how hard it would be to write openly about sex until I signed up ― and then failed ― to do it. I couldn’t predict how much I cared about keeping, as Friday calls it, my “Nice Girl, Good Daughter self” intact. Discussing sex was “extreme” to my family and far worse to the Berkeley students whose nasty comments flooded the articles online, calling me an attention whore, among other expletive-laden insults.  Which is to say, what women are allowed to feel, think, say and write about sex has changed since Friday’s book was published in 1973, but not entirely. There’s still a long way to go until female masturbation is viewed as a routine, auspicious element of coming-of-age narratives, and women’s fantasies are a source of power and camaraderie rather than secrecy and guilt.  “I do think a lot of women are likely to begin fantasizing after reading this book,” Friday said in 1973. “Or rather, become aware that they have been fantasizing all along, and that these sudden odd ideas or notions they have up to now forgotten, or repressed, are indeed fantasies.”  I pray this article has a whisper of the effect. Reader, what is your fantasy? "
ARTS & CULTURE,"As Trump's Scandals Mount, Filmmakers Gravitate Toward Short-Form Responses","In the year since Donald Trump’s election, American art has adopted barbed subtexts. Suddenly, so much of the popular culture we consume is a corollary to the social and political implications raised by the melodrama of the current administration.  A Guardian headline from February: ”‘Get Out’: The First Great Paranoia Movie Of The Trump Era.” A Vanity Fair query from June: “Is ‘The Handmaid’s Tale’ The Allegory Of The Trump Era?” A Washington Post proclamation from that same month: “Why Wonder Woman Is The Perfect Hero For The Trump Era.” A Variety digest from July: ”‘War For The Planet Of The Apes’ Cast On Trump Parallels: ‘It’s Unbelievable.’” An Uproxx offer from September: ”‘Battle Of The Sexes’ Directors Discuss If The Film Is Secretly About Hillary And Trump.” A Vulture summation, issued a mere six months after the inauguration: “We’re Reaching A Turning Point In Trump-Era Pop Culture.” As our president and his affiliates grow more scandal-ridden by the day, each of the aforementioned talking points remains intriguing and worthwhile. But they’re also convoluted: All of these projects were conceived long before Trump neared the White House, and most were filmed before he even clinched the Republican Party’s nomination last July. Their themes about racial inequality, gender divisions and immigration biases have been relevant for centuries, but even films and TV shows that have taken last-minute inspiration from our current political climate owe most of their conceptual ideologies to pre-Trumpian contexts.  For the most part, we won’t have a clear picture of Hollywood’s artistic response to Trump until 2018 or even 2019, when the projects now in development and production come to fruition. (“American Horror Story: Cult,” which offers a flimsy parable about a country divided by post-election rifts, may be the closest we’ve come to a fictional response to the so-called Trump phenomenon. For comparison’s sake, the late-1970s Vietnam War movies “Apocalypse Now” and “The Deer Hunter” weren’t envisaged until nearly the end of the 20-year war. They opened a few years after the conflict concluded, sharpening their ability to  respond to such a global tragedy.)  But at least one medium has seen an immediate uptick in artists commenting on our polarizing current events: short films. “That’s where the shorts format can be most exciting, especially for documentary filmmakers,” Vimeo curator Ina Pira told HuffPost. A member of the five-person team that selects Vimeo’s coveted Staff Picks section, which can vault a video to varying degrees of internet fame, Pira has noticed that more of the platform’s recent submissions are political in nature, especially in the nonfiction and music-video realms. Some of the short videos Vimeo showcases are made in as quickly as a few months, or even a few days. Popular topics, she told HuffPost, include climate change, the aftermath of the election and Europe’s current refugee crisis. Timing is key. Unlike feature-length films, which often require two-plus years and hundreds of thousands (or millions) of dollars to make, short filmmakers can deliver commentary on current events while those events are still current, for comparatively little money. Similarly, sites like Vimeo and NoBudge, a free platform run by Brooklyn-based filmmaker Kentucker Audley, allow directors to skip the complex distribution models that only sometimes amount to widespread attention. Everyone longs for a snazzy Sundance premiere, but many of those movies struggle to find an audience beyond the insular festival circuit anyway. Instead, digital launchpads allow filmmakers to reach audiences quickly and cheaply.  Audley pointed to a 14-minute fiction film called “Unpresidented” as an example of the dexterity privileged to short-form storytellers who don’t need the vast resources that most feature-length filmmakers require. “Unpresidented,” about a New Yorker’s attempt to justify his bet that Trump would win the election, premiered at last month’s New York Film Festival and screens at this week’s Nitehawk Shorts Festival in Brooklyn before launching on NoBudge by the year’s end. That’s an example of the synergy that’s become prevalent among the network of artists and curators making and supporting short-form content. Of course, not all of the political work in the short-film arena is so literal. In Audley’s eyes, stories that amplify the voices of groups most damaged by the administration’s rhetoric and policymaking can be just as potent; the word “Trump” is not required in order to resist the White House. “I don’t think you have to respond to the pinprick of President Trump for your film to resonate with a post-Trump world,” Audley said. At NoBudge, which typically houses unconventional, independently made shorts and feature films, most of the submissions Audley receives are not grounded in hard-boiled issues like those hosted on Vimeo or funded by the Tribeca Film Institute’s If/Then initiative, which issues grants for short documentaries that convey “diverse perspectives” of global proportions, according to producer Mridu Chandra.  “Short films are not as culturally relevant in general as features,” Audley admitted. “I feel like people really don’t have that much exposure to short films in the mainstream.” When it comes to mainstream audience’s historic embrace of short films, Audley is right. In the early days of American moviegoing, the cost of admission included shorts and newsreels that would screen ahead of the headlining feature. Then the genre was sidelined to festivals, attended mostly by dedicated cinephiles, industry gatekeepers and high-brow types. Today, filmmakers are relying on internet platforms to foment a renewed appreciation for video pieces that run anywhere from two minutes to half an hour.  Pira has noticed that comment boards on Vimeo’s topical shorts are more electrified than ever. Communities of likeminded individuals are engaging with material that finally speaks to the representation that corporate popular culture sometimes lacks, even if well-made movies like “Get Out” and shows like “The Handmaid’s Tale” are underscoring protracted social ills. Vimeo Staff Picks, especially, has become an anchor for work that finds broad recognition. “Best of Luck with the Wall,” a seven-minute project that used satellite images to sketch the overwhelming vastness of a potential fence dividing the United States and Mexico, racked up more than 1 million videos and was covered by news outlets like Salon, Splinter News and the Daily Mail. And “4.1 Miles,” a 21-minute snapshot of the European migrant crisis, landed on Vimeo and The New York Times’ website before earning an Oscar nomination for Best Documentary (Short Subject) earlier this year.  “When the election happened, I think everybody’s priorities changed a little bit,” Eleanor Wilson, an Australian-born filmmaker living in New York, told HuffPost. “All of a sudden, it became a thing where it’s like, ‘Well, if I’m a person who’s putting a voice out into the world, I actually need to think about what it is that I truly want to say now.’ For me, it changed how I thought about storytelling a bit. If I’m going to go to all the trouble for making a film and finding financing, it’s either got to be extremely politically relevant or it’s gotta be a really good time.” Wilson does not have to “worry” about box-office revenue or other traditional benchmarks of cinematic success. She can deliver her work to hungry audiences with a few clicks of her keyboard.  “It really opens up options for the audience when you can say, ‘Oh, this can just live online and that’s all it has to do,’” she said. “It doesn’t have to fit anybody else’s needs.” The fifth annual Nitehawk Shorts Festival will take place Nov. 7-12 in Brooklyn, New York. HuffPost is hosting a panel during the festival called “Why Shorts?”, which will be held on Nov. 9. For more on the festival, head to Nitehawk’s site."
ARTS & CULTURE,"The Making Of 'Alias Grace,' A Margaret Atwood True-Crime Mystery","If “The Handmaid’s Tale” is where we’re going, “Alias Grace” is where we came from. So says Sarah Polley, the writer and producer behind the new Netflix adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s 1996 novel. The work of historical fiction revolves around the titular Grace Marks, a 19th-century servant accused of brutally murdering the master of her household and his mistress, a fellow housekeeper, with the help of a stablehand. The real-life crime rocked Upper Canada in 1843, hurling the Victorian community into a salacious trial that amounted to a life sentence for Marks and a hanging for her accomplice. After 30 years in prison, Grace was eventually pardoned, but her exoneration was a mere consolation prize after decades of living as a notorious woman. “Murderess is a strong word to have attached to you,” Marks says in Atwood’s book. “It has a smell to it, that word ― musky and oppressive, like dead flowers in a vase. Sometimes at night I whisper it over to myself: Murderess, murderess. It rustles, like a taffeta skirt across the floor.” Polley brought the beloved Atwoodian tale to life with the help of acclaimed “American Psycho” director Mary Harron. Together, they created a six-episode miniseries that places Marks, expertly played by Sarah Gadon, as its center of gravity. She at times appears powerless, the product of poverty and neglect forced into an unforgiving life of servitude, and at other times as a careless and deliberate enigma, driven by an internal force we’ve yet to understand. Is she a cold-blooded killer, or a unduly scorned castaway? Both Atwood and the Polley-Harron adaptation team shy away from answering that question. Instead, the new Netflix series is at its best when it sinks into the historic details that complicate Marks’ narrative. In the show’s meticulously crafted world, an echo of real 19th-century horrors, lower-class women are relegated to sexual prey, cast as the constant targets of unwanted advances and the unfortunate recipients of botched abortions. Indeed, if “Handmaid’s Tale” is the fundamentalist dystopia of our future, “Alias Grace” makes it its mission to paint a clear picture of the overlooked history that would make Gilead possible. We spoke to Harron ahead of the show’s premiere on Nov. 3. and she echoed Polley’s unnerving parallel between both hair-raising Atwood adaptations, and explained what it was like bringing the story of Grace Marks to life. What initially drew you to the adaptation of Alias Grace?  Well, I hadn’t read the novel. I knew nothing about the story going in, I had no preconceptions about it. But it’s such a fantastic plot. You get totally drawn into this world. I’ve always loved ambiguity and mystery, and also a female character who suffers a lot but isn’t conventionally, like, “Oh, poor Grace.” She’s very complicated. Is she good? Is she bad? Have the things she’s suffered turned her into a murderer? All of these things. I was very drawn into the world right away. Were you a Margaret Atwood fan before this? Yeah, I’m Canadian, so of course. I was also at university in the ’70s when her first novels started coming out. Or, at least, that’s when I started discovering them. She had a big impact on feminism at the point ― of that generation. I was very affected by the stories that she was telling. But I hadn’t read her most recent stuff. So it was a real revelation. [Alias Grace] is actually my favorite Margaret Atwood novel now. The novel is based on a real crime that happened in Canada in the 1840s. Were you aware of the story of Grace Marks at all? I read a couple reviews of [Atwood’s] book when it came out, but I had never heard of [Marks]. It was very mysterious. I’ve done a lot of period drama ― my first film [“I Shot Andy Warhol”] was the 1960s, “Bettie Page” was the 1950s, “American Psycho” was the 1980s. I studied literature at university ― I’m pretty steeped in the Victorian novel ― so I always wanted to do a period drama like this. This is a very interesting take on a 19th-century story. The story revolves around perhaps one of the most enigmatic characters Margaret Atwood ever wrote. If you could give your own character description of Grace Marks, what would it be? This is important: She’s a young girl, Protestant, from Northern Ireland. She’s very competent and capable and bright. She’s the sort of person who could have run a corporation, but she’s born into a world of incredible poverty and oppression, and she suffers greatly. She’s quite puritanical, like a lot of Northern Irish Protestants. I can say that, because my family’s from there. She has love in her heart, but the question is: With all her sufferings, did they make her a better person or a worse person? With all the terrible things that she has had to go through, which way did they turn her in the end? I had this conversation with Margaret Atwood. People think that suffering makes you noble, but not always. Sometimes, a lot of suffering can turn you. It can make you vindictive and murderess. You don’t know.  Yes, that’s certainly one of the intriguing aspects of the way Atwood wrote the character. You don’t necessarily know if Grace is the protagonist or the antagonist of the story. And that doesn’t really seem to be the point. There’s not a whole lot of morality to it; it’s simply an interesting character exploration. Yes. It’s a real-life story. Although there’s not a lot known about Grace, there are certain historical records and interviews with people at the time about what happened during those murders. I love real-life stories, because the behaviors are always so contradictory. It’s like ... why? Why didn’t you tell anyone? Why, when the butcher answered the door, didn’t you tell him that [James] McDermott was going to kill someone? You know? It’s funny, when Sarah Gadon and I were going through the script and making notes on the character together, we were like, “Grace, what were you thinking?” You think you know her, Grace. You think you have a line on her, but then there is some piece of the story that puts that out of whack. As with Simon [Jordan] during the drama. Simon is constantly being turned around and bewildered by her, and banging his head against the wall, because you can never quite get a handle on who she is.   During a TIFF masterclass this year, you told audiences that the key to eliciting a standout performance from your actors is “entirely casting.” What was the process like casting Sarah Gadon in the role of Grace? How did you know she was the one? I had worked with her before, six or seven years ago, on a movie called “The Moth Diaries,” in which she was playing 16 [years old], actually. I’d seen hundreds of people for the role I cast her in, and she actually recorded an audition for me on her computer, because she was filming overseas. As soon as I saw her, I thought, this girl is remarkable. When you meet her, she’s sort of an old soul, a very impressive person. And working with her, she’s very subtle. She does what I really like in actors, she does a lot of layers. She makes adjustments very quickly. Even as a young actress who hadn’t done that many movies, she could make these incredible subtle changes and imply a lot going on below the surface. And also, with Grace, you want someone who is very beautiful, but who has a mystery to them, which she has kind of effortlessly. You could really just watch her face for a long time. And with Edward [Holcroft], too. You know, there are these long scenes where they are just sitting in a room talking. You want to be able to linger on their faces. What kind of research did you do before filming ― in terms of reading up on the era and real-life crime? Margaret Atwood had recommended some books. She gave Sarah Polley a sort of book list, and I read one in particular ― a 19th-century woman’s account of traveling through Canada. That was really interesting on the condition of servant girls as sexual prey. It’s always interesting to read contemporary accounts that give the attitudes of the time. Margaret Atwood had done so much research into language. Usually I’m very bothered by period inaccuracies and dialogue anachronisms, but Margaret Atwood has done all the work. She is very authentic, not just in how people talked, but how they thought and behaved. You know, women thought in very different ways [in the 1800s]. Grace saw her life very differently than a woman today sees her life, or sees sexuality, religion, everything.  But in terms of the kind of research I had to do, that was more with the production designer about getting the actual details of the world right. And for Sarah Gadon, she had to learn how to do all this housework! She had to learn how to sew and quilt. I didn’t want her faking, and she didn’t want to either. She’s quilting throughout so many of those conversations, so she had to be so good at it she could do it without looking. And it has to be completely natural. She spent weeks and months learning. Domestic labor is a whole story in that. Watching [Gadon] as Grace, you can actually see calluses on her hands. Right! I was with the makeup department and I was like, “You have to roughen her hands.” She has beautiful hands, you know. So she did some of it herself, and then we had the makeup team roughen them up, too.  You spent time at Ontario’s Kingston Penitentiary, where the real Grace Marks actually spent time during her lifetime. What was it like filming there? That was another interesting thing. When I read the script, the way that they were written, the cell was a much bigger cell. But when we went on our location scout to Kingston Penitentiary, and also to penitentiary’s museum, we saw a reproduction of a prison cell from the 19th century. It was almost a 5-foot coffin, the size of a single bed. And that’s where people would spend half their lives. I was very taken by this, by this idea that [Grace] was buried alive for all these years ― all of the prisoners were. So I had to persuade everybody, because it made it much more difficult to shoot, to make the cell smaller. She could still stand up, because we made it a foot wider. I knew it would be hard to shoot, because we couldn’t get the camera inside the room, but the production designer agreed with me ― this is important and we need to make it real.  The other thing that came out from that museum, which wasn’t actually in the original script or the book, was this thing called “the box,” where they’d put prisoners inside this upright coffin. There’s this scene with Grace where you see her face in a little hole in the wood and she’s screaming. We just saw that box, and I asked Sarah [Polley] to write that in. It’s horrifying. It’s medieval. I mean, the rules ... you get whipped for looking or whispering or if you laugh or smile. It was barbaric, and we wanted to show that for real.  Was that difficult for Sarah Gadon to perform? Did the authentic setting bring a different kind of gravity to the script? I thought it did. It was tough on her. I stepped inside that box to see what it was like and I was like, oh my God, let me out. I wouldn’t force an actress to do it, but I think most actresses who are taking it seriously want to go there and experience some of this. One of my favorite lines from the 1996 NYT review of “Alias Grace” reads: “There’s nothing like the spectacle of female villainy brought to justice to revive the ancient, tired, apparently endless debate over whether women are by nature saintly or demonic.” This is obviously a central theme in Atwood’s book. How did you and Sarah Polley go about bringing this “debate” to light in your adaptation? Sarah Polley has a really great quote about this, about women conforming so much and playing to other people’s expectations of them. Of women playing different roles and playing different people in different circumstances. That’s what she’s referring to in those first few words of the script, when [Grace] says, “People think I’m a female demon. People think I’m a poor innocent victim. People think I’m this and that.” What is the essential woman? Victorian women, especially, have all these images put on them.  I also loved the idea that one woman can be seen and get to portray a character in such different ways, without you knowing which is the real one. That allowed a much more complicated female character. One of the things I love about Margaret Atwood is that she’s never like, “Men are bad and women are good.” She’s writing about harsh social pressures and injustices that don’t always bring out the best in people. Like the relationship between Grace and Nancy [Montgomery], who are both really victims of society, both working-class girls, one of whom is pregnant and has managed to claw a little status for herself. I think Margaret Atwood has this view of women that they can become like rats in a cage ― they can turn on each other, because there’s so little safety for them. That was very truthful, about how tough social settings can bring out competitiveness and rivalries. You would like to think that women are always [supportive], but … What was it like having Margaret Atwood on set? And directing her in a cameo role? Oh, it was fun. I didn’t have to do too much directing. There was a lot of panic because the schedule had gone wrong. It was like the second day of shooting, and she was waiting around in a heavy costume in 90 degree heat for hours and hours. We were like, “Ahhhh.” But she was very good about it. And I think she was very amused, because on her trailer it said, “Difficult Woman.” That was her name in the [episode]. How much, if at all, did she shape the adaptation?  I don’t know, I’m not privy to that. Sarah showed her a lot of the drafts at every stage, I think. I think [Atwood’s] pretty hands off, but Sarah Polley was anxious that it be very faithful, so she ran a lot of it by her.   Obviously the whole show is coming out in the wake of “Handmaid’s Tale” Season 1. If it’s possible for there to be more fandom around Margaret Atwood, now seems to be the time. Many fans saw “Handmaid’s Tale” as an overtly feminist show that inspired a lot of activism. Did you envision “Alias Grace” as an overtly feminist show? It’s feminist in the sense that it’s presenting a neglected and important piece of female history, which is the lives of female servants in a realistic way. The story of Mary Whitney happened to tens of thousands of girls. Hundreds of thousands of girls got pregnant, were raped or were seduced and abandoned, were sexual fodder for upper-class men. And that’s a really neglected part of history, you know, of what these girls’ lives were like.  Sarah Polley said that “Alias Grace” is where we come from, and “Handmaid’s Tale” is where we might go. It’s important politically to know where you come from in an accurate way. The same thing is happening with how we look at slavery or the Confederacy and the Civil War. It’s important for us to dig back and say, “We have certain versions of the past, but are there other versions we need to be aware of?” In this case, there’s a somewhat idealized view of the country house, and the happy servants who love their masters and the masters who care for their servants. Is this true? No! Those servants were unbelievably exploited. Especially the young women, who were sexual prey to all the young men. They’d get pregnant, and that was the end of them. What was it like to get an abortion back then? Well, we’ll show you. It’s not even that long ago, and that’s what our society’s grown out of. We need to remind ourselves of that. I remember when I was living in London there was this idea of returning to Victorian values. Well, those are Victorian values: child labor and young women being thrown out into the streets. That’s our history.  That theme seems particularly relevant in a time when a president wants to “Make America Great Again.” [Laughs] A lot of the time we want to idealize the past, and that can have a political agenda behind it. People idealize the 1950s in America for the same reason ― that was a Reagan thing. Let’s return the ’50s. Well ... segregation. In terms of women’s stories, there a lot of stories that haven’t been told and perspectives that haven’t been shown. “Alias Grace” is not necessarily as obvious a call to action [as “Handmaid’s Tale], but that doesn’t mean it’s not an important perspective. You have a history of showcasing women’s stories. You’ve made films about Valerie Solanas, Bettie Page and Anna Nicole Smith. Are there any other outré women, who might similarly challenge notions of femininity, that you’d be interested in spotlighting in a film? Right now I’m casting for this Manson girls project. The interest there is: How do these seemingly normal, hippy girls end up doing these terrible things? What was their relationship to the cult? Why did they give over their will to this crazy leader? Part of the film is set in the early ’70s, when they are in prison, and part of the story is told from the Manson ranch. People don’t really take an interest in the girls when they tell that story. They don’t really show how it happened ― how they came to do these things. How could they? How did they? What’s the story there? There was this young feminist in her early 30s who came and gave classes to the Manson girls and wrote a book about them. I’m always interested in an untold story. And not just a straightforward story of a noble struggle, but looking at quite complicated issues of female behavior. Can’t get more complicated than the Manson girls. Taking it back a bit, you refused to cast Leonardo DiCaprio in “American Psycho” in part because his fan base at the time consisted of teenagers, and because you’d already tapped Christian Bale. What was it like pushing back on studio executives at the time? Well, I got fired, so that’s what it was like. [Editor’s Note: Harron was eventually reinstated as director of “American Psycho.”] Or you could say I quit, but they fired me because I didn’t want to meet with DiCaprio and I didn’t want to cast him. I’d already said I would cast Christian, who wasn’t famous at the time. Leo was. I think everyone thought I was crazy. There were two things: I thought Leo was a great actor but he wasn’t right for it. Christian was right for it. And I would never make a film if I didn’t think the lead was right. But I also knew that if they brought on the biggest star in the world for “American Psycho,” they’d totally rewrite the script and I would lose control over the tone of it. I also thought it was totally inappropriate for this actor with a huge fan base of young girls to play this role. It just seemed wrong on so many levels. It was an advantage with Christian Bale to have someone who wasn’t as famous, because people didn’t have a lot of preconceptions. His fame didn’t get in the way. I’m very, very specific about casting and I’ve been through many casting battles. I don’t think I’ve been with a film without having a casting battle. It’s the one thing that’s make-or-break for me. I really will not do a film if I don’t think the lead is right for it. No good film was ever made if the lead was miscast. Making a film is hard enough. But Netflix was very good. They said, “You don’t have to cast stars.” And I think this will make a star out of Sarah Gadon. Has it gotten any easier over the course of your career to assert yourself in that arena and have a position of power in these casting dilemmas? No, it really hasn’t. And you’d think it would.   Last question: Why isn’t “I Shot Andy Warhol” available to stream anywhere? I just saw Christine Vachon, the producer, at the premiere of the Todd Haynes movie [“Wonderstruck”], and she said they’re looking into getting the rights back. It’s one of those things, the company that distributed it went out of business. It breaks my heart that that film isn’t available. There are all these great actors in it. Lili Taylor. Justin Theroux’s first film! I would so love to see that film back. So, we’re working on it. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity. “Alias Grace” is now streaming on Netflix. "
ARTS & CULTURE,Someone Put Up A Plaque To Mark The Spot Where Trump Bragged About Groping Women,"A plaque briefly marked the spot where President Donald Trump made his comments on the “Access Hollywood” bus about groping women without their consent. According to CNN, someone installed the satirical memorial in the parking lot of NBC’s Burbank Studios in Burbank, California, last week.  “On this spot in September 2005, Donald J. Trump bragged about committing sexual assault,” the plaque read. “In November 2016, he was elected President of the United States.” “Legends of Tomorrow” visual effects editor Seth Gottlieb wrote on Facebook that the producers of his show were behind the stunt. It was “in dishonor” of Trump and his comments to Bush “which happened on our lot,” he said. The show’s executive producer, Phil Klemmer, revealed on Twitter that the plaque lasted about 15 minutes before studio workers took it down: It took our offices 15 minutes to take down this plaque.  The truth remains. pic.twitter.com/Yqwked5ldx"
ARTS & CULTURE,When Booting Dead White Guys Off Reading Lists Is A Good Idea,"“Student forces Cambridge to drop white authors,” blared a front-page headline in U.K. paper The Telegraph on Wednesday. Beneath was a large, above-the-fold photo of Lola Olufemi, an English literature student and activist. The caption claimed that Cambridge University would drop “some white authors” in favor of black writers following “demands” made by Olufemi and other students. Just a few enormous problems: Cambridge had made no concrete plans to change its curriculum, Olufemi and her peers certainly have no power to “force” the prestigious and powerful school to do so, and the students had made no “demands” to excise white authors. What Olufemi had done is co-author an open letter to Cambridge faculty, signed by over 100 students, detailing concerns with the marginalization of postcolonial work and writers from the Global South in the English curriculum. It concludes with a list of suggestions, including “the inclusion of two or more postcolonial and BME [Black and Ethnic Minority] authors on every exam paper” and the addition of “a short seminar series in first year looking at postcolonial texts and thought.” After uproar over press coverage, The Telegraph eventually printed a small correction noting that “the proposals were in fact recommendations,” the students did not call for “the University to replace white authors with black ones,” and, to be clear, “there are no plans to do so.”  ""Remember that black student yesterday, the one on the front cover, who was attacking white authors? Yeah, we made that up. Sorry."" pic.twitter.com/eaAx4l8HkT The sheer journalistic malpractice of the article, which quite predictably resulted in the pictured student ― a black woman ― receiving abuse and threats online, has drawn considerable outrage. “It is actually staggering irresponsibility by the Telegraph and The Daily Mail to take a small-scale matter for the English department to consider and turn it into, what to me looks like incitement to race war,” Priyamvada Gopal, senior English lecturer at Cambridge, told Buzzfeed on Wednesday.  That a black woman, and non-white authors, were presented as a dangerous threat to a British university played gleefully into the hands of white nativist forces, which often frame institutions built through centuries of white supremacy and imperialism as the victims of violent cultural erasure at the hands of today’s politically correct brigands. But the media controversy threatens to overshadow the problem the students originally hoped to highlight ― a foundational problem with the English literary canon. Even as we correctly point out that the Cambridge open letter, “Decolonising the English faculty,” didn’t make any demands or force the university to dropkick white male authors into the dumpster of history, we should note that the suggestions therein were not only reasonable, but urgently necessary ― not just in the U.K., but here in the United States. **BREAKING NEWS* brought to you from @Telegraph. Women of colour have taken over Cambridge University, I am now Supreme Vice Chancellor, @CUSUWO Student Dictator, all white men have been locked up pending execution, and students will ONLY STUDY BLACK WRITERS. Resistance is futile Despite years of activism on college campuses, many English students today can still enroll in programs that do little or nothing to ensure that graduates will be educated in the work of authors of color and, to a lesser extent, women. Though many colleges have added courses on women writers, African-American literature and so on, such classes are often electives rather than required, foundational courses, and non-white male authors remain relatively sparse on the reading lists of required survey courses.  This approach allows English departments to amp up the overall diversity of a department’s offerings without substantially changing the reading lists of core introductory classes ― and even with these pushes for inclusion, there’s still a long way to go. Despite efforts to include more women writers in college humanities courses, overall, men still hold significantly more spots on syllabuses than anyone else.  “Any required classes we have, like early and late British lit, are almost completely white-washed and male,” Mercedes Gonzales-Bazan, a student at the University of New Mexico, told HuffPost. “There’s usually one text from a POC and one text by a woman, but never intersectioned.”   Cristina Stubbe, a recent graduate of Emerson College, reported the same experience to HuffPost: All of the required classes for English majors were dominated by white male writers. “We had to take British Literature, the Art of Fiction and Literature Foundations (all of which were predominantly white and male, even though there are plenty of nonwhite authors that could be studied for both courses).” Later, she said, she took classes with more diverse offerings, like International Women Writers. “It was great that they offered these courses,” she said, “but we have to spend our first two years not being able to take classes like that because they are an optional course.” “It’s frustrating because as students we have to actively seek out literature courses that incorporate a diverse set of authors and ideas,” said Gonzales-Bazan. “So unless a student is determined and passionate enough to focus on finding diversity, then they’re sitting blind and unaware to the lack of it within most of their courses.”  This is also often the case in classes that cover literary movements (unless, like the Harlem Renaissance, the movements are specifically non-white-coded). “For example, many teach courses on modern American poetry by focusing on the biggest figures, say: Eliot, Pound, Stevens, Williams, Frost. Maybe they throw in Langston Hughes or Marianne Moore as a nod to ‘diversity,’” Jacquelyn Ardam, currently a visiting assistant professor in English at Colby College, told HuffPost. “But white man’s modernism is just one version of modernism.”  In her own courses on modernism, Ardam teaches a more expansive syllabus, including Jean Toomer, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Mina Loy and the early work of Gwendolyn Brooks. “These are figures whose work is often overshadowed in the dominant versions of modernism on our syllabi,” she explained. By including one or two token women and people of color in our curricula rather than reimagining those syllabuses from the inside out, we imply that they are less deserving of our full attention; they are included as a gesture to their otherness rather than through merit. The focus of a literary curriculum on white men doesn’t only send an implicit message of exclusion to students who don’t identify as white men ― it emboldens white male students in beliefs about their own worth relative to that of other students.  In 2006, I was a freshman in college, and I enrolled in a double-credit, two-semester seminar on the Western canon. The class, which took up as much space in one’s schedule and transcript as four other classes would, was billed as a foundational class for humanities majors, and I was lucky to get in. But the whiteness and maleness of the class curricula could also be infuriating. I suffered, not-so-patiently, gripes from white male classmates that literary greats like Jane Austen and Sappho had been included in our extensive, almost entirely male syllabus thanks to P.C. pearl-clutching rather than merit. (Apparently we were taking up good class time that could have been spent on another white male philosopher, poet or historian.) But the overall white maleness of the course clearly confirmed, in the minds of many of my classmates, that all the true great thinkers of our humanities tradition have been white men. Several current or former literature students recalled to HuffPost experiencing direct tokenization and bigotry in their departments. Stubbe remembered one course, in which a white professor had assigned a text by Gloria Anzaldúa. During the class, she said, “I was forced on the spot to translate a block of Spanish text with no warning, simply because he thought I could, as the token Latina in the class.” Another woman, who asked not to be named because she fears it could hurt her graduate school applications, recalled a department reading for her M.F.A. program at which a white male professor read a personal essay called “N*ggerbaby.” The essay reflected on his black nanny and a game he played as a child in which, the woman said, “he and his friends would pretend a ball was a ‘N*ggerbaby.’ They would throw it and see how far they could run before it smashed into the ground.” At the end of the essay, she said, the nanny is portrayed as wise for being unbothered by their hurtful words.  As a black woman in a mostly white crowd, she says she was horrified but felt that she “couldn’t speak. And even if I could, anything I said would be from the irrational black woman in the room, the one who puts identity over academics.” One student, a white man, challenged the professor about the problematic racial perspective of the essay, but was quickly dismissed. “Afterward, I hid in the stairwell,” she recalled, “angry and crying.” Aman Kumar, a former classmate of mine who graduated from Princeton with a degree in comparative literature and later studied at Columbia, told HuffPost he saw “casual sexism and racism among faculty and students” throughout his studies. When studying the traditional canon, he said, “their political or personal noxiousness or crimes were rarely discussed, in deference to The Text Itself. On the other hand, lazy caricatures of anyone packaged as ‘peripheral’ seemed compulsory.” The close, reverent readings of our white male writers urge students to bestow generous and specific consideration to each of them; meanwhile, we often present marginalized writers as avatars defined by their race, gender or sexual identity ― or we simply don’t present them at all. Ardam recalled a class she taught at UCLA in which she assigned The Mixquiahuala Letters by Ana Castillo, a novel about two Latina women traveling through western United States and Mexico together. “After we wrapped up discussion of that book,” she told HuffPost, “two students came up to me separately to say: I have never read a book about someone who looks and talks like me before. This was in Los Angeles in 2015.” And also, who cares? Stepping outside the literary canon of dead white men is a good thing - and unis are already doing it! https://t.co/eQirvvCuCC Students can and should learn from authors who look like them and share their experiences, allowing them to see a place and a relevance for themselves and their lives in the canon. They also can and should learn from authors who don’t look like them and don’t share their experiences ― as people of color, women and non-binary people, and members of other marginalized groups are often called upon to do. But white men are rarely asked to engage with literature from another perspective ― and that fundamentally inhibits their own learning, as well. The exclusion of literature by authors of color, women and other underrepresented groups, and the frequently oblivious attitude toward the racial and colonial attitudes of white canonical authors in literature programs, should be a self-evident problem. After all, protests against diversifying these curricula often rest on harms to the culture and psyches of white people, especially white men. In response to my Twitter query about people’s poor experiences with whitewashed English syllabuses, one person responded, “What if we’ve been prevented from having good experiences with great curricula because the authors were, say, cishet white males?” Another complained, “I’ve [had] experiences w/ females teaching students to be ashamed of their whiteness, does that fit your narrative?” The reality is that, insofar as a writer not appearing on a required course syllabus constitutes “preventing good experiences” with that author, it’s unavoidable that even the luckiest students will be prevented from good experiences with great writers. There are more great writers than colleges can reasonably teach in four years; they have to pick and choose. The question is whether they’re maximizing the knowledge and personal development of their students through the reading lists they’re choosing. This is an art, not a science, but a strong, deeply entrenched preference for the work of white men is not a merit-driven factor. Sticking to the traditional canon is more a form of intellectual laziness, in which we comfortably default to familiar white names rather than pushing ourselves to learn from a larger body of literary achievement. Kumar described the tendency of many accomplished humanities professors to ignore philosophers, social scientists and authors outside of certain geographical and temporal regions as “sheer sanctioned ignorance.”  For those who only care about the white students whose education and, presumably, feelings are being hurt by the increased inclusion of non-white writers, it must be noted that pressure to diversify curricula is not coming solely from students of color. As Cambridge student Jason Osamede Okundaye pointed out in a Guardian piece, “By making [Olufemi] the solitary figure behind the decolonization movement at Cambridge, the coverage ignores the fact that heavy support for diversifying curriculums has come from white students.” Perhaps because curious young English students don’t go to college hoping to remain ignorant about important aspects of their field ― whether it’s the work of Shakespeare, the racial and colonial ideologies underpinning much of the traditional canon, or long-marginalized but brilliant writers. An acceptance that vast parts of literary history (the parts involving non-white people, primarily) won’t be addressed isn’t intellectual rigor. It’s a distortion that will ultimately harm the education of students ― and implicitly encourage women, students of color and other minorities to feel ashamed of their identities. Intentional dismantling of that bias is a necessary step toward building a true canon that highlights the best and most vital works in English literary history. This isn’t a new idea, and the Cambridge open letter didn’t introduce it. I spoke with several educators who have been working to redefine the boundaries of the canon, and students who have benefited.  Danielle Badra, who has taught as a graduate assistant at George Mason University in recent years, said she “specifically design[ed] all of my curriculum to include only marginalized authors ... I was never taught enough of those categories in grad school.” She taught both required introductory courses and electives, and said her students “all loved the literature they were assigned. Most of them said they were happy to be learning about something new and reading stuff they hadn’t been assigned before.” Nor is it just individual instructors ― there are larger movements away from a stuffy, exclusive white canon in English departments. “Curriculum change can be a long and tedious process, but it does happen, and often in good, if incremental ways!” Ardam told HuffPost. “While I was a graduate student, my school ― a large public institution ― moved away from a conservative curriculum which required historical surveys of British literature as well as single-author courses on major figures: Chaucer, Shakespeare, Milton.” Instead, the major now offers “a more conceptually-based curriculum” that requires students to take “historical surveys of literature” as well as courses in areas like “gender, race, ethnicity, disability and sexuality studies.” “This change in the curriculum decentralized ― [though] by no means expunged ― the stories of dead white men,” Ardam said. “Many, if not most, English departments across American have made similar changes in the past two decades.” As Ardam and the Cambridge open letter emphasized, this simply doesn’t mean erasing white men. Shakespeare, Keats and Hemingway stand little chance of being pulled from shelves or eliminated from college courses. But simply because they’ve always been there doesn’t mean that white male writers are always the most deserving of being on our reading lists. Curricula can and should change, and they’ve long done so for other reasons ― certain writers falling out of style, others being remembered, movements experiencing renewed interest. In the process of adding women, people of color and other marginalized artists to our syllabuses, we will inevitably have to make some room. Maybe some white people won’t be happy with the choices that college faculties make, the dead white men who are left off of introductory surveys or who are studied through the lens of their race and gender. To which we can only say, now you know how everyone else has felt for hundreds of years."
ARTS & CULTURE,An 'Accidental Dictionary' Explores How Errors Created The English Language,"If you see it in the dictionary, it’s so: This deferential trust seems to be the general attitude toward dictionaries, whether it’s the Oxford or the Merriam-Webster. You can’t get Scrabble points for your clever conjugation unless it’s in the official dictionary, and teachers tend to reach for red pens when neologisms crop up in term papers.  But while the dictionary offers neat columns of words, followed by clear and definitive meanings, it is a haphazard document at its heart. Language itself is a constantly shifting, changing thing, so any guidebook to it also reflects those shifts and changes ― and over time, the book itself must be edited and reedited to reflect an evolving linguistic reality. That’s the premise of The Accidental Dictionary, writer and etymologist Paul Anthony Jones’ latest book. (Jones, who runs the @HaggardHawks Twitter account and blog, has written several engaging books about etymological curiosities over the past few years.) “Under scrutiny,” writes Jones in the introduction, “the dictionary reveals an unpredictable network of etymological crossed paths, U-turns, and forks in the road.” The Accidental Dictionary takes the form of a dictionary ― a 100-word dictionary ― and adds that scrutiny, revealing the many lives each word has lived.  “Clumsy” once meant “numb with cold.” “Hallucinate” once meant “deceive,” and “prestigious” once meant “deceitful.” “Queen” once meant “wife.” (Viewed from a relatively enlightened, feminist era, that one is rather disappointing.) Somehow, these words were shunted sidewise, rejiggered or tweaked; though they’re still familiar to us today, their meanings have entirely changed. Though we might conceive of rapidly shifting slang and improper usage as ailments of our modern society ― and, you know, kids these days ― Jones’ work is a potent reminder that the words we use have never been static. English speakers have been molding and playing with the language for centuries, and that’s not changing any time soon. In a few hundred years, who knows what our accidental dictionaries might look like? In an interview with HuffPost, Jones spoke about our changing language in the age of the internet, the patchwork foundation of modern English, and some of his favorite odd etymologies: Rather than having an ongoing narrative or argument, this book really is in dictionary format. How do you think it should be read? I’m one of those strange people who reads dictionaries for fun, but even I don’t read them cover to cover! And so I had presumed that readers would dip into The Accidental Dictionary like any other reference book, reading a few entries here or there. But since the U.K. edition came out last year I’ve had a lot of emails and tweets from people saying that they have actually sat down and read it from start to finish ― each word’s little potted history works like a single short story I guess, so the book has ended up acting like an etymological anthology. Do you see the book as having an overarching takeaway or argument? What can we learn about our language from these stories? If there’s one thing to take away from this book it’s that the language is always changing. It’s easy to think that once a word finds its way into the dictionary it’s set in stone, but that’s of course not the case. Not only are new words being coined and old words being lost every day, but existing words are being molded and mutated, and knocked into different shapes to better fit what we need them to mean. If this book only serves to prove that the English language is still very much active and alive, then it’s done its job. Which word’s story do you find the most delightful or surprising? I have to admit I have a few personal favorites: I love the fact that a cupboard was originally a table, and that pink was originally yellow (and in that sense probably derives from pinkeln, an old German dialect word meaning “to urinate”). But the stories I keep coming back to are those of words like man, girl and bimbo. These have not only changed their meaning over time, but in doing so have essentially changed their sex.   Man originally meant “human” (as it does in words like mankind and manslaughter), so was once used of both men and women. Same goes for girl, which originally meant just “child,“ and so could be applied to both girls and boys. And a bimbo was originally a burly, thickset man ― like a gangster’s heavy, or some enormous brutish bully. In the sense of someone who is appreciated more for their physique than anything else, bimbo eventually came to be applied to an attractive woman, and thanks to some (cringingly sexist but no less popular) music hall songs in the mid-1900s, this eventually became the word’s only surviving meaning. So much so, in fact, that a word for a male equivalent, the “himbo,” had to be “re-invented” in the 1980s. Although we might expect words to change over time, for them to change their gender in the process is quite startling I think.  How did you compile the list? Was it a long-term project of adding as they came up, or did you set out to find these words? A lot of the words on the final list had come up before in blogposts and tweets on Haggard Hawks, so the book really offered the opportunity to dive into their histories in more detail. But once I’d started researching this all more broadly, I ended up with a shortlist of about 200 possible entries culled from etymological dictionaries and glossaries. I eventually whittled that down by half by focusing just on the words whose stories I thought represented the greatest or most surprising changes.   Were there any words you wanted to include that didn’t quite make the cut, and why did they get axed? Oh, plenty! Jackpot was one I was sorry to cut out. Originally it referred to a pool or “pot” of cash in a card game that accumulates until a player can open the betting with a pair of jacks or better. I’ve always had a bit of a soft spot for etymologies that are staring you in the face like that. A few, like the fact that a secretary is literally a “keeper of secrets,” made the final cut ― but this one seemed just a little too straightforward alongside the other 100 in the book. I was also sorry to leave out the fact that fizzling originally meant breaking wind, but with G-strings and feces both making the final cut, that was just one questionable entry too many! Did you find any base-level theories for why words change in meaning? Is it just happenstance, or widespread ignorance of a word’s original meaning, or perhaps an ideophonic affinity between the word’s sound and the meaning it acquired? I don’t think there’s one solid rule or explanation for why words change, but because the book covers entries from Old English right through to the modern day, what did become clear is that the impetus for these changes has itself changed over time. So way back in the Old English period, many changes were driven by the fact that the English vocabulary was growing so enormously, particularly with influence from French words borrowed after the Norman Conquest. The fact that English adopted the word boy from French, for instance, is probably the reason why girl came to change as boy began to encroach on its meaning.  In the Middle Ages and beyond, you can see literature start to play a bigger part: writers, authors and poets bending the meanings of words to suit what they want them to mean. And to an extent, that has continued in the modern era through journalism as well as fiction: it was newspapers, for instance, that popularized the figurative use of the word blockbuster to describe something extraordinarily impactful or successful in the 1940s. Before then, it was the name of a huge aerial bomb developed by the RAF that was capable of literally destroying a block of buildings.  Being a language born of various roots, is English more prone to evolving in this way than a language with a more homogenous history? Or do we see it just as much in other languages? I think all languages certainly see elements of evolution over time: people are naturally curious and inventive, and as no language exists outside of its speakers and users, if they begin to use a word in a new context or adopt or invent words to replace others then the language as a whole will change to accommodate them.  But you’re right ― the English language has such a checkered, sprawling history that I think it is likely more liable to change than most. If you think about how lengthy its history is, how much of the world it has touched and been imposed upon, and just how numerous and how diverse its speakers are today, you start to see just how unlikely it is that English would remain unaltered, at any point in its history.  This seems like something of a rebuttal to prescriptivism, showing that even words we feel we know very well have evolved over time. Do you think this book makes a case for a descriptivist approach? I certainly wouldn’t want say this book actively argues for descriptivism or against prescriptivism ― it’s just recording the facts. But you’re right that seemingly the facts here just so happen to support a descriptivist approach to language more than the prescriptivist one. If every time a word was used in a new or innovative way or context a prescriptivist approach quashed the change and slapped the word back into place, the language would never have evolved in the way it has and we would doubtless be left with a less rich vocabulary as a result.   Is there any value, in your eyes, in a prescriptivist approach? Is there anything to gain by trying fix words’ definitions in place rather than rolling with the evolutions that arise? I think there can be value in formalizing a language certainly, and if that comes even in part from a prescriptivist approach then so be it. After all, it’s by establishing rules and norms that languages become mutually intelligible among all their speakers, and are both translatable and learnable to speakers of other languages.  What does not have value in my eyes is using those rules to make judgement calls on other people’s use of the language, or to point out “mistakes” other people may have made, which is what the prescriptivist cause is often commandeered to do. One of the very first things I was ever taught when I first started studying language more than a decade ago was that there is no such thing as right and wrong; there is standard and non-standard, and they are in no way the same. You can break as many rules as you want ― all that matters is that you’ve communicated what you need to communicate effectively and have been understood. Does it really matter that you’ve split an infinitive or used “disinterested” instead of “uninterested” in doing so? Not one bit.  A lot of these word-change stories go back centuries. How is the Internet impacting how, and how quickly, words evolve? The internet and social media age is probably coining as many new words as it is altering existing ones, but either way I think it’s undoubtedly accelerating the process. Say a word gets used in a certain way on a reality TV program. People watching it then tweet about it. Fans start using it. Then journalists and academics (and people like me) start writing about it. And suddenly the word has changed or gained an entirely new meaning, all within a matter of months, perhaps even weeks.  This recently happened over here in the U.K. with a (terrible but still massively popular) reality show called “Love Island.” The contestants on there started using the word “muggy” to mean “untrustworthy” or “deceptive.” That meaning has certainly found its way into millennial slang, and if it continues to be used will doubtless begin to find its way into some dictionaries. The question is whether it will ever oust the existing meaning of muggy from the language. This interview has been edited for clarity."
ARTS & CULTURE,'The Angriest Librarian' Schools Columnist Over Anti-Library Tweets,"Don’t mess with librarians.  New York Observer columnist Andre Walker learned that lesson this week when he called for the closure of public libraries, and posted tweets critical of librarians. Nobody goes to libraries anymore. Close the public ones and put the books in schools. https://t.co/Cimy1V81n5 Thousands responded to Walker’s initial tweet, noting the valuable role libraries play in communities. Among the educators and advocates tweeting their responses was Alex “The Angriest Librarian” Halpern:  Hang tight folks, because I am about to drop some necessary knowledge on you. First off, library usage is on the RISE motherfuckers. https://t.co/reWrJj3XCo As conservatives have taken over state and local governments, and the NO MORE TAXES crowd has gotten their way, public space has decreased. That means is that there are a lot fewer free, public gathering places in America anymore. What's one? The motherfucking public library. If you, like this jackalope, think libraries are just warehouses for books, you are sorely and embarrassingly mistaken. Sorely. In addition to meeting a community's need for educational and recreational materials, PARTICULARLY FOR YOUNG FAMILIES... public libraries are evolving to meet the demands of the 21st Century, unlike the neanderthal who sparked this thread. Books? Books make up a RAPIDLY decreasing percentage of a library's budget. You want to check out technology? get a library card. You need internet access because you are one of the WAY TOO MANY underserved and marginalized persons in America? Go to the library. You need a safe place to learn about yourself, LGBT teen? Come to the library. You need to learn English to get a job? Come to the library. You need to close libraries because you have no idea what the fuck they do? Stay the fuck home and shut your mouth. Just kidding, everyone is welcome at the library, even the backwards thinking simpletons who want to cut our budgets. I could go on and on about what libraries do in the 21st century, but I'm too fucking steamed, so if you want to know, ask. More than 100 people responded to Halpern’s tweets, praising his comments and sharing their support for libraries. So, the Angriest Librarian was happy again.  I am heartened by the number of people who love their library. I am now less mad online. A friendly message to all my new followers: go get yourself a fucking library card. But then, Walker doubled down on his initial claim.  I know this makes Librarians angry but shutting libraries and putting the books into schools would be an absolute good. https://t.co/AEy4X0iAAx This fucking guy is still going https://t.co/jDXVnrqX3w Librarians are like French teachers. These jobs exist in order to pay the wages of sad people who can't get proper work. Imagine being this guy https://t.co/sxbShhkARL After receiving a flood of responses, Walker walked back his original comments. Dear #Library users, I surrender! pic.twitter.com/1F0cog6xo0 As for Halpern, he now has thousands of new library-loving followers: Library twitter is lit af this week get on board The 6000 of you who followed me in the last day are going to be very disappointed when I return to tweeting about star wars and baseball"
ARTS & CULTURE,Norman Rockwell's Hallelujah,"“It’s a cold and it’s a broken Hallelujah” – Leonard Cohen I had never seen the actual painting, just poor, darkened reproductions. But I felt and understood the picture my grandfather painted in 1950 even before I laid eyes on it; it was painted as the family crisis escalated and my grandmother Mary’s impending breakdown loomed like an invisible wraith inside the home, something you could sense more than see. Shuffleton’s Barbershop is arguably Norman Rockwell’s masterpiece. It is chiaroscuro at its best – a noirscape of an after-hours moment in a small town barbershop. It appeared on the cover of the Saturday Evening Post in the spring of 1950. I felt apprehension, a well of emotion coming to the surface, as I sat in anticipation of seeing the painting in person for the first time. Would it live up to my expectations or disappoint me? I knew I was going to encounter my grandfather in a very different, more personal way this time. After researching their lives I now know what he and my grandmother were struggling through when he painted it; how they tried to shelter their three boys from the extent of my grandmother’s growing inner disturbances and the reliance on alcohol she hoped would soothe her inner wounds that were a mystery even to her. Her illness was their secret. Yet everyone knew. A bank of darkness had descended on what was supposed to be the perfect American family. The prevailing instinct is to protect that loved one who is emotionally and mentally ailing. And then to protect your children and yourself. Mary had dedicated herself to my grandfather and his work for over 15 years before she began to collapse. She had never individuated – she went from being an overly protected, isolated child to the wife of an already famous and successful American illustrator, 15 years her senior. And when the buried trauma and attending internal scavengers began to surface within her, she tried everything to find a solution – went to doctor after doctor, becoming attached to each one – until she snapped one day at a coffee counter in a service station in Arlington, Vermont in the dead of winter in early 1951. She broke down into uncontrollable tears as she sat with the younger family doctor who had been trying to analyze and help her. Perhaps in that moment she realized he couldn’t save her, he didn’t have the answers either, and once again, she was left with her overwhelming existential pain. She had improvised an infatuation for this doctor that was just an illusion. It is hard to separate Pop and Mary because in many ways they had always operated as a team. While some other couples slept in monastic side-by-side twin beds, my grandparents pushed their two mattresses together to make one bed. Each Saturday Evening Post cover was a labor of agony and love for both of them. Mary would often drive the models back and forth to the studio, cook lunch for them, scour the countryside for the specific props that Pop needed for each painting. My grandfather also used Mary as a model repeatedly. They had help – Pop always had an assistant in the studio and she had housekeepers in the home.  But when she began to seek out psychiatrists in the late ’40s, two of these male doctors unwittingly pulled her and her marriage apart in destructive ways. They questioned how she responded to her husband intimately without guiding her toward a real solution. They challenged her very concept of womanhood; one California doctor provided strange rules and edicts of wifely/female conduct. They began to open her up, yet failed to get to the root of her fragmentation, and then abandoned her. All of this swirled around me as I was led into a small side room at Sotheby’s in NYC – suddenly there was my grandfather’s painting on the wall, waiting for me. I felt shock that I had been granted such immediate access in this private viewing. This is the painting that had haunted me from afar. What struck me first was how much more light there is in the original than the reproductions – there is so much more to see. The influence of Rembrandt – his view of the “deep mysterious” – is unmistakably echoed in Rockwell’s ambitious use of glowing light and stark shadows. In the midst of the darkened room lit by secondary light, the radiant gold of the window sign letters and the bright orange of the fiery hearth call out contrast and almost beckon you inside. Hints and pops of color sneak in through the carefully displayed magazines and comics in front and the patriotic poster on the back wall. The observer is not just the black cat in the darkness with its right ear pulled back in uncertainty or annoyance; it is Norman Rockwell standing outside the cracked window – where his uncentered, diminished signature lingers – an isolated viewer, kept apart from the light of creativity and festive music in the illuminated back room. The older men play with calm joy, yet he remains an imprisoned outsider in the cold looking in. He is not completely alone, he knows his audience looks in with him from the same vantage point. He is quietly asking us for empathy – see, he silently nudges you, this is how I’m feeling, perhaps I’m not so alone after all. The symmetry of the two chairs with chipped paint like two guardians at the gate. The poorly painted window pane with layers of unscraped paint over the years, leaving paint marks on the window. The old broom leans against the wall as another character, its bristles peaking out from overuse. The startling clarity of the hot stovetop and the back light hitting the stovepipe where it enters the wall. A pair of shoes and a pair of beat up boots warm by the fire. The comforting softness of the worn ivory barber cloth draped over the arm of the chair; the channel of light from the other room exposes the intricate detail of the foot rest. Stray cigarettes from the day scattered on the floor. The revelation of the painting is the impressionist reflections in the back window – a play of gradations of gray. Pop always finds a way to surprise me. There is a tender dance between chaos and order, community and isolation. Pop had a number of reference photos of the cat taken. He enlisted his young son Peter and together they cajoled the cat into the correct pose; Pop sitting on his legs right by the cat, Peter on all fours, gesturing out in front. The first model, a round black and white tuxedo cat, wasn’t in the mood to cooperate. Pop replaced him with an all black cat with a leaner back who was more amenable. Did he really need the cat there? And why did he slightly cartoon its figure? Was it a form of slight sabotage to add that “Norman Rockwell” stamp of sentiment or did he feel he needed the ominous presence of a black cat looking on from the shadows – as he was feeling at that time? A grim harbinger of what was to come – perhaps Pop attempted to undercut the gloomy specter with a touch of humor.  When I stood back from all the details and silently took the painting in from the other side of the room a strange thing happened – the painting seemed to come to life dimensionally and allow me to enter into it. I was now the observer standing right outside the barbershop longing to be a part of the music in the back room – the barbershop opened up to me and I was transported inside – I knew that I could enter the lit back room if I wanted to. And that is the affirmation – it is the joy of art, of music, of community that saves us in those dark moments. It always saved Pop. Sotheby’s is planning to auction Shuffleton’s Barbershop and Shaftsbury Blacksmith Shop on November 13. Once again controversy circles around Norman Rockwell – people have always parasitically attached themselves to him, forged their identities by associating themselves with him and his work. He has attracted that sort of adulation and animus since his art entered into the public eye. People both revere and disparage his vision. Art is not created to stay in one place, it is created to move about and benefit the world. That is part of the magic of the artistic process – there is no true ownership. All of us are merely temporary custodians. These two paintings were painted in Vermont. Pop donated Shuffleton’s in 1958 and Blacksmith Shop in 1966 to the permanent collection of the Berkshire Museum in Pittsfield, MA. The Berkshire Museum decided months ago to auction much of its art, including the two Rockwells, in an attempt to reimagine its future. What would Norman Rockwell want? He would want the two paintings to be placed where the most people would have easy access to them, to experience his work for themselves. His art is the art of the people. If this auction goes through, Mr. George Lucas, I am calling on you... to save the day, rescue the Rockwells and become the faithful custodian of them at your new museum. Hope persists, in spite of it all."
ARTS & CULTURE,Radical Latinx Artists Reveal The Violent Sides Of Pregnancy And Motherhood,"In 1985, Cuban-born, Mexico-based artist Marta María Pérez held a knife to her naked, pregnant stomach and took a picture. The resulting black-and-white photo shows the knife-wielding mother-to-be, her face cropped out, her individuality erased. It’s a jarring representation of motherhood, a far cry from the sunny, idealized images that flood social media and lifestyle magazines. Images that suggest mothers are ― and should be ― docile, domestic, faultless and, more often, white.  “I immediately thought of the movie ‘Psycho’ when I saw this photo,” writer NeKelia Henderson wrote in 2010 of Pérez’s work. “Well, the maternity version anyway.” Pérez’s photo is part of “Radical Women: Latin American Art, 1960-1985,” an expansive survey of work by Latinx women now on view at the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles. Together, the women paint a picture that diverges from the endorsed model of motherhood, blissful and devoid of complications or conflict. Instead, their moms are political, angry, salacious, outspoken, spiritual and experimental. Their images of motherhood welcome pain as well as love, truth as well as fantasy, horror as well as tranquility.  As Hammer guest curator Andrea Giunta, who organized the exhibition along with Cecilia Fajardo-Hill, put it: “They propose more realistic maternities, crossed by different cultural, social and political registers.”  Pérez’s menacing nude photo is called “Do not kill animals or watch them be killed.” The title, the artist explained to HuffPost, refers to the Afro-Cuban superstition that a pregnant woman who either kills an animal or witnesses a killing will give birth to a child with violent or criminal instincts. The myth echoes the 17th- and 18th-century conviction, upheld by some male philosophers and medical professionals of the time, that a pregnant woman’s unknown imagination could affect ― and potentially infect ― the unborn child forming inside her.  If a mother experienced shock, hunger or lust, her child might arrive with physical deformities, leading experts thought. So when children were born with disabilities or afflictions, the mother’s “monstrous imagination” was up for blame. According to Princeton professor Marie-Hélène Huet, male scientists and philosophers would respond to a childbirth gone somehow awry by asking: “What woeful maternal fancy produced such a monster?” A version of this misogynistic anxiety lingers today thanks to a variety of persistent spiritual beliefs and superstitions, including those belonging to the Santeria religion Pérez ascribes to and interrogates. Her “Do not kill” image, in particular, is part of a larger series called “The Conceived,” for which she documented her experience carrying twins. She processed her pregnancy through the lens of her religion and its superstitions and taboos. The photos are “omens,” Marcela Guerrero writes in a catalogue essay, offering “an unromanticized view of maternity that transgresses Western notions of motherhood.” The series’ titles are inspired by anthropologist Lydia Cabrera’s El Monte, an in-depth description of the major Afro-Cuban religions, which include Santeria, Yoruba and Palo Monte. Another of Pérez’s photos, titled “Born to you strangled by the cord,” depicts the artist topless, from just below her lips to just above her nipples, wearing only pearls. The title nods to the unsubstantiated belief that wearing a necklace while pregnant can result in a child being strangled by his or her umbilical cord. Over the years, as medical technologies have evolved, the scientific community has debunked many of these beliefs, relegating them to the domain of spiritual superstition. However, a laundry list of still-potentially dangerous activities for mothers-to-be has taken their place: no smoking, no drinking, no caffeine, no high heels, deli meat or soft cheese. The list goes on. From policing thoughts to policing actions, the cultural desire to regulate and control pregnant mothers continues. Women are still expected to be impeccable parents ― even before their child arrives. Ultimately, it can be difficult to draw a line between responsibly protecting a child and unnecessarily policing a mother. As Lynn M. Paltrow, author of When Becoming Pregnant Is a Crime, wrote: “Recognizing ‘fetal abuse’ moves us toward criminalizing pregnancy itself because no woman can provide the perfect womb.” Pérez isn’t the only artist at the Hammer to skewer conventional representations of “baby bumps.” Johanna Hamann’s plaster-cast “Bellies” ― representations of pregnant stomachs that dangle from metal hooks, their contents spilling down like diaphanous fabric or human entrails ― recall both dresses lined up in a closet and carcasses dangling in a butcher’s display. As curator Giunta put it, “They refer to the relationship between maternity and trauma in at least two senses: a subjective one, visualizing aspects of motherhood that social stereotypes eliminate, and, on the other hand, referring to violence in Peruvian society of those years, to which the police and military forces of the state were linked.” Idealized images of pregnancy might suggest that miraculous transformations into motherhood occur in a vacuum, but in reality, some women approach this phase of their life under a variety of external pressures, including political oppression and social unrest. In 1979, the year Hamann began work on “Bellies,” Peru was transitioning from military to civilian rule under President Francisco Morales Bermúdez. Her mother-shaped casts pay tribute to the pain inside a woman’s body, as well as the world beyond it.  While Hamann and Pérez visualize pregnancy, another artist, Louise Grobet, explores what happens post-birth. In her 1981 photograph “La Briosa,” a woman in a lucha libre mask feeds a bottle to an infant. As Giunta explained, mothers and homemakers in Mexico serve as both spectators and players of the carnivalesque and sometimes brutal sport of amateur, freestyle wrestling. In her photo, Grobet collapses the distinction between gentle mother and campy fighter. Both test the body’s limits and urge a woman to perform a designated role that has deep-rooted history in pre-Hispanic culture. “In this sense,” Giunta added, “maternity is linked to a form of festive and symbolic violence.”  Violence is also palpable in Chilean artist Gloria Camiruaga’s 1984 film “Popsicles.” In it, her daughters eat popsicles with little plastic soldiers in them, chanting “Hail Mary” in between licks as the residue of their sweets stains their lips and teeth. Camiruaga described the work as a “rosary of alarm, eternal and circular.” Her daughters engage in outwardly innocent childhood activities ― making devotions, eating sweets ― all the while cognizant of the threat of violence beneath the surface; the toy soldier is meant as a reference to dictator Augusto Pinochet, who ruled Chile with an authoritarian military government between 1973 and 1990.  “With this performance she refers to the dictatorship of Pinochet, but also puts in a critical place her own motherhood, using her own daughters.” Giunta said, “We have to think that dictatorships, and social and police violence in general, generate violence that specifically targets the female body [...] even caesareans practiced without anesthesia on women in prisons.” The physical experiences of pregnancy, birth and motherhood are far from the pristine, ethereal events that some mainstream representations would suggest. In the United States, the maternal mortality rate is rising, with 28 maternal deaths occurring per 100,000 births in 2013. Non-fatal injuries are far more prevalent. According to Mother Jones, between 50 to 80 percent of women who give birth experience tearing of the pelvic skin and muscles, and around half experience urinary incontinence. Three quarters report residual back pain.  For women of color and women in marginalized communities, pregnancy invites additional hurdles. In 2008, a large-scale federal immigration raid in Iowa led to the arrest of 389 predominately Hispanic workers at a meat-processing plant. Babies born 37 weeks after the raid had a 24 percent higher risk of lower birth weight than those born the year before, a study at University of Michigan showed. Mothers also had an increased risk of preterm birth following the raid. For many Latinx women in America right now, particularly undocumented immigrants threatened by the policies of President Donald Trump’s administration, a euphoric pregnancy is not an option.   The artists of “Radical Women” unflinchingly confront the realities of birth and motherhood, no matter how painful, ugly, confusing or taboo. Western culture asks women to prescribe to the myth of motherhood as something immaculate and miraculous ― with any deviation from the norm perceived as weakness or insubordination on the part of the mother. Artists like Pérez, Hamann, Grobet and Camiruaga refute these expectations, complicating the idea of motherhood and illuminating the work, trauma and alarm that go into creating and raising a child.  “Radical Women” runs at the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles until Dec. 31, 2017. "
ARTS & CULTURE,We Talk About Fonts All Wrong. Here's A Better Way.,"The average person today has access to seemingly unlimited fonts ― and with such great power comes great responsibility. One can use Curlz MT on a resume or Brush Script for a party invitation, but should one? Though trained designers might have a clear idea of the best fonts for each task, most of us laymen are reduced to guesswork, instinct and the guidance of edicts like “never use Comic Sans.” But this prohibitive attitude toward font freedom doesn’t necessarily serve us well. At least that’s the argument of Douglas Thomas, the author of Never Use Futura ― a celebratory new history of the iconic font, which does not actually condemn all uses of Futura. “I decided to use the title in part as a provocation, and as an ironic commentary on how most of the conversation around fonts people have is housed in a negative,” Thomas told HuffPost in a phone interview. “People know not to use Comic Sans and maybe Papyrus ― those are things you just shouldn’t do. But very rarely do people understand why they should use a typeface.” The full title of his book, Thomas pointed out, is actually Never Use Futura Unless You Are ... followed by a long list of famous people, brands and organizations that do use the typeface. (A few of the notable Futura users, listed on the front and back of his book, include: Nike, Fox News, Ikea, Vanity Fair, Politico, Forever 21 and In-N-Out.)  “I’m hoping to poke a little fun at that sort of conversation ― designers can say, ‘oh, the masses shouldn’t use Futura, but we can, in these ways,’” he added. This hypocritical anti-Futura rhetoric suggests that maybe the problem isn’t bad font choice ― it’s that designers just want to keep the good fonts to themselves. Does this sound paranoid? OK, maybe so. But there’s a grain of truth there, too. And understandably so: Overuse of a font isn’t just annoying, it can make the font less useful to designers. We naturally associate fonts with the ideas and brands we’ve seen them presenting or adjacent to in the past.  “Futura started out as this avant-garde idea,” Thomas pointed out. “It was linked with some of the newest, most cutting-edge ideas in Europe.”  Created in the 1920s by German Bauhaus designer Paul Renner, Futura was meant to capture the modernism of the time. It was closely linked with progressive political and cultural ideals ― equality, democratization, globalism and even socialism. “When Vanity Fair first used it in 1929, people were appalled,” Thomas told HuffPost. “There were editorials written calling this a Bolshevik revolution.” Not only did the magazine use all lower-case for article heads at first ― a clear attack on hierarchies and an endorsement of anarchy, in the eyes of more conservative onlookers ― the font itself was freighted with political meaning.  Then, well, everyone started to use it, and that changed the font’s impact. When we see Futura now, we probably think about Wes Anderson films or Kate Spade or Vogue ― the fact is, as Thomas recently wrote for Fast.Co, it’s a font that’s been linked to a lot of concepts, political movements, media outlets and corporations. Merely by the fact of the font’s widespread use, it’s necessarily been sapped of its power to convey strong ideas. “In graduate schools and high-end design firms, there’s this constant search for new typefaces that aren’t being used that can be filled with new ideas and aren’t linked to past moments and movements,” Thomas said. Sometimes brands or publications achieve that by designing their own exclusive typeface, like the New Yorker’s Irvin. That doesn’t mean Futura is no longer a good font, or that it’s never appropriate to use. Most of us don’t go to design school, but that doesn’t mean we can’t learn more about how to use fonts. We just have to pay attention to what different typefaces convey and what effect they’ll have. For example, said Thomas, when people use Comic Sans in a professional setting, they usually convey the wrong tone.  “It just seems both completely inappropriate and maybe showing a lack of judgment, the same way we’d judge someone if they stepped out of their house naked. Maybe we’re all fine with people choosing how we want to dress, but there are,” he added, “times and places for things.” Comic Sans isn’t inherently bad, though. “If it’s being used in a communication to a preschool group or in a comic book, for crying out loud,” he said, “it would be perfectly appropriate.”  See, every font has its purpose. Probably. (We still haven’t decided about Papyrus.) “Every typeface has its own voice, speaks in its own language,” Thomas concluded. “Once you understand what that language is, you can use it in exceptionally insightful and beautiful ways.”  We just have to take the judgment away from the process, stop talking about what fonts can’t do, and start embracing what they can do."
ARTS & CULTURE,George Saunders Wins 2017 Man Booker Prize For His First Novel 'Lincoln In The Bardo',"LONDON (Reuters) - American author George Saunders has won the 2017 Man Booker Prize, a high-profile literary award, for his first novel, “Lincoln in the Bardo,” a fictional account of U.S. President Abraham Lincoln burying his young son. In his acceptance speech, Saunders, 58, noted that “we live in a strange time,” adding he saw the key question of the era being whether society responded to events with “exclusion and negative projection and violence,” or “with love.” Saunders was the second consecutive American writer to win the prize, after the rules were changed in 2014 to allow authors of any book written in English and published in the U.K. to compete. His novel, set in 1862, a year into the American Civil war, is a blend of historical accounts and imaginative fiction, which sees Lincoln’s son Willie, who died in the White House at age 11, in “Bardo” - a Tibetan form of purgatory. The judging panel, led by author and member of Britain’s House of Lords Lola Young, praised the “deeply moving” book, saying it was “utterly original”. Saunders was presented with his award by the Duchess of Cornwall. Last year, American Paul Beatty became the first American to win the award, for his novel “The Sellout,” a biting satire on race relations in the United States. Other previous winners have included this year’s Nobel Prize-winning novelist Kazuo Ishiguro, Salman Rushdie, Iris Murdoch and Canadian writer Margaret Atwood. The award was previously open only to writers from Britain, Ireland, Zimbabwe or countries in the British Commonwealth. The winner receives a $65,000 cash prize."
ARTS & CULTURE,Stark And Beautiful Photos Of Resilience From The Storm-Battered U.S. Virgin Islands,"When two category 5 hurricanes slammed the U.S. Virgin Islands just two weeks apart this September, the storms devastated vital infrastructure in the territory home to more than 100,000 Americans. But the 200-mph winds also decimated foliage with the efficiency of a plague of locusts. The island paradise to which, for decades, millions have flocked to say wedding vows or simply vacation under the bright Caribbean sun amid dazzling blue water and lush greenery dotted with colorful flowers was left temporarily stripped of vegetation, the water clouded by runoff. “The most heartbreaking thing for me,” said Savanna Goodman, a photographer and longtime resident of St. Thomas, “was that the colors were gone from the flowers, the trees, the water, along with my job, my apartment, and my entire routine.” Goodman responded with “Our Colors Will Not Fade,” a photo series that showcases the bright colors of Carnival costumes against the stark backdrop of the wreckage. The photos highlight the vibrancy ingrained in the culture of the USVI, and the islanders’ indelible resilience. “The people of the Virgin Islands are what makes this place so special. The water is already clearing, and the trees will be green again,” she said. “We’re still here, glowing like always. I hope that I was able to capture that, and that’s what we really need the world to see.” “I’ve done Carnival makeup for many different troupes over the years. I was excited when Savanna approached me with this idea because it was a chance to do something creative again, something other than haul debris.” - Shary Cruz, who did makeup and costuming on the project. You can find more of her work on her Instagram page.  “Although I'm saddened by the destruction that has taken place and how it has affected myself and those I love, I am optimistic that we can rebuild and make this beautiful Caribbean gem better than it was before.” -Crystal Maree, model.  “My V.I. culture cannot be contained; it cannot be dimmed by tragedy. The colors of the Carnival costumes we wear are a direct representation of our spirits. They will not fade; they will not falter. They will bloom in the face of adversity. I will bloom in the face of adversity.” - Nicole Smith, model.  “Something like this keeps me positive somehow because we have the greatest thing of all and that for many of us islanders is hope. In a time when you think everything would tear us apart, it’s actually brought us all together!” -Meagan Ann Bryan, model.  “As we continue forward we will not stop growing, strengthening, and blooming our cultures colors more beautifully vibrant than ever. Our Colors will not fade.” -Natalie Harris, model. This is just a small selection of the photos in Goodman’s series. For more from “Our Colors Will Not Fade,” you can follow the photographer on Facebook and Instagram.

ARTS & CULTURE,Ai Weiwei Believes The U.S. Has Hit A Low When It Comes To Human Rights,"Through his new project, Ai Weiwei aims to powerfully illustrate a humanitarian crisis.  The legendary Chinese artist, best known for his criticisms of the Chinese government, traveled across the globe, capturing the refugee crisis over the course of the year. The result is “Human Flow,” a documentary that features scenes from 23 countries, painting a picture of the experiences of those who have fleed their homes for a better life.  The film opens in New York and Los Angeles on Friday, on the heels of the artist’s New York City art installation “Good Fences Make Good Neighbors.” More significantly, the documentary is being released against the backdrop of a contentious travel ban limiting entry from several Muslim-majority countries, first introduced by President Donald Trump in January. In fact, Trump recently capped U.S. refugee resettlement at 45,000 ― an all-time low. In a way, Ai told HuffPost, his work is a message to the Trump administration.  “It’s about basic human rights. Defending our dignity, defending humanity,” Ai said. “The U.S. today has really come to the lowest credit in those issues ― admitting refugees in such a small and unacceptable number and also trying to push out people who have been here for a long time.” Ai’s documentary takes viewers through Greece, Iraq, and Malaysia, among a host of other countries, stressing the massive scale of the human migration. It’s shot during a time of “unprecedented” levels of displacement, with more than 65 million people forced from their homes, the UN refugee agency says.  The refugees are shown making dangerous trips at sea to Greece, others with their belongings strapped to their backs, trekking their way across Europe. More are seen in refugee camps, seemingly attempting to find a shred of normalcy. There are scenes at the U.S.–Mexico border, featuring an uncomfortable encounter with a border patrol guard. Ai makes appearances at some of the locations, often adding moments of levity.  “Human Flow” is also peppered with stunning bird’s-eye views of glistening bodies of water and other breathtaking landscapes. Then the camera zooms into the scenery to show dire situations ― people crammed in boats, trying to make it to shore, or refugees in camps searching for food, often waiting for hours. This contradiction shows that the crisis is completely manmade, Ai said.  “I wanted to put this human crisis in the most powerful, beautiful indifferent nature,” he said. “We don’t appreciate what’s given to human beings. We’d rather create this hatred or war or discrimination. ... The nature is very generous, very open to everybody. Humans create the most ugly fences.” Though the documentary tackles crises born out of unique circumstances, the poor treatment of minority communities is a common theme. And it’s one that hits home too.  People of color and immigrant communities have been used as scapegoats at various points in U.S. history and painted as national security or economic threats. In fact, during his campaign, Trump portrayed China as the “economic enemy,” which experts felt could be why hate crimes targeting the Asian-American community in Los Angeles County tripled in 2015. Ai has seen this time after time, he says. “It only shows the narrow understanding of politicians and the public [to think] that someone is stealing jobs,” He told HuffPost. “They need to focus on creating jobs. If the economy ... declines, they always blame someone else.” While Ai rose to fame for his outspoken statements on freedom of speech and the Chinese Communist Party, his focus on the refugee crisis isn’t part of some trend or fad, he insists to HuffPost. His activism is rooted in his experiences as a child, observing the way his father — famed poet Ai Qing — was punished and exiled for his work, he told HuffPost.  His defense of human rights extends across the globe, he says, much like the film.  “I always, always think of humanity, human rights [issues] as one. I’ve never separated it,” he told HuffPost. “People think I’m someone against the Communist Party ― Yes, I’m against totalitarian society, but more than that, I am a defender of human rights as a more general condition.”"
ARTS & CULTURE,Chinese Museum Removes Photo Series Comparing Black People To Animals,"A series of photographs by Chinese artist Yu Huiping has been removed from China’s Hubei Provincial Museum after inciting global outrage, The New York Times reports.  The shocking images were part of an exhibition called “This Is Africa.” Each juxtaposes a picture of a black African with a picture of a wild animal making an analogous facial expression or gesture. The series of 150 photographs seemingly compares black people to animals including lions, chimpanzees, giraffes, leopards and baboons. The series is titled ”相由心生,” a Chinese idiom that, according to The Shanghaiist, translates to something like “outward appearance follows inner reality.” The photos went viral after museum goer Edward E. Duke, who is Nigerian, posted an image of them on Instagram. “The capital museum in Wuhan, China put pictures of a particular race next to wild animals why?” the caption read, tagging news outlets including CNN and BBC. The post has since been removed.  The Shanghaiist reported on the exhibition, calling it “astonishingly offensive.” However Zhao Yingxin, the president of the China Photographic Publishing House, was far less critical. “Yu Huiping’s photography is perceptive, smart and visually impactful, capturing the vitality of primitive life,” he said. “The photos seem to jump right out of the lens, leap out of the screen.” The photos were taken down after receiving a slew of complaints. Wang Yuejun, a curator at the museum, told The New York Times that he was responsible for exhibiting the people’s and animals’ faces side by side. “In Chinese proverbs, animals are always used for admiration and compliment,” he said. After realizing that the images “hurt the feelings of the African tribespeople,” he opted to remove them.   China has a nasty track record of exhibiting casual racism. On Thursday, the popular app WeChat apologized after Ann James, a black American living in Shanghai, discovered its built-in translation feature translated the Chinese phrase that commonly means “black foreigner” to the N-word.  “If you’re a black person in China, you’ve come up against some craziness,” James said. “I know there’s a lot of curiosity and a lot of ignorance about black people.”"
ARTS & CULTURE,Casper’s Traffic Box Program Turns Intersections Into Public Art,"Being stopped at a red light is an aggravating experience, even in a smaller city such as Casper, Wyoming, where an across-town commute may only last 20 minutes. It takes valuable time out of the day and can make you late. It’s also not very interesting or thought-provoking. But what if idling at an intersection was a beautiful experience? Roadside beautification projects are nothing new. Highways, freeways and major intersections have been treated to beauty regimens for decades.  Since 1965, highways across the country have benefitted from the Highway Beautification Act, and one can hardly drive across the country without noticing a bevy of flowers, trees and, in some places in the southwest, rock art.    But left out of this campaign were the many intersections and strips of roadways that traverse cities throughout the country. Many towns and cities have begun to beautify the daily commute with flowers, trees and public art. Casper’s traffic box program seeks to take the mundane and ordinary control boxes of hated red lights and make them a masterpiece of public art. Something worth pausing for. The project started as a way to deter vandalism, a way for the traffic department to get out of the task of cleaning crude words, symbols and sophomoric scribblings off the boxes, but it’s become one of the more popular programs of Keep Casper Beautiful. It started in 2010 with one experimental box. The box remained untouched by vandalism for seven years. In 2016, Keep Casper Beautiful received the go ahead from Casper Public Services to start a traffic box program, and four boxes downtown were wrapped with original art work. Keep Casper Beautiful worked with the local artists guild on an open call to all artists within the county. A few submissions were received, and a panel selected three works. The public voted on a fourth. In 2017, Keep Casper Beautiful again put out a call to artists county-wide and received three times as many submissions as 2016. Clearly, word was spreading among artists that this was a public art project that would be worth the work of a submittal.  Five more boxes were wrapped using the same panel and public vote process. Calls and letters started to come into the Downtown Development Authority office praising the art and the effort. Keep Casper Beautiful receives calls and comments on social media regularly concerning the art. Happy citizens and visitors even call City Hall to express their appreciation. Artists often call the office to make sure they did not miss the call to artists. Keep Casper Beautiful has plans to continue wrapping traffic boxes each year.  The cost to the program is minimal. Artists receive a small fee for the use of their art but maintain the rights to the work. The vinyl wraps are sometimes donated, leaving labor for installation as the only cost.  At $2,000 each year, the program budget is small and more attainable than some public art projects, which can cost a city tens of thousands of dollars for one work. Printed vinyl was chosen to keep costs low and to ensure that boxes could easily be cleaned should they be vandalized. Among the most debated items on the budget sheet is the artist fee.  Some have felt that recognition is enough payment, while some have felt that the fee should be raised. As the Keep Casper Beautiful director and a performing artist myself, I have always felt that artists should be paid for their work and that exposure is not payment. The opportunities for paid work are often few and far between in small communities. Often, lesser-known local artists are left out of public art projects completely, as they are either not invited to submit or lack the qualifications to meet the standards set by the request for proposals. Currently, I support the modest fee, as it encourages an array of artists to submit work and does not intimidate young or amateur artists who may have never sold work. I also firmly believe the project has support of local artists because of the fee payment. Local artists want paid opportunities in their communities, and they want some of those opportunities to be public art. While the public art project is not groundbreaking ― we are not the first organization to decorate traffic control boxes, nor are we the first to use public art to transform spaces and deter vandalism ― it is transforming the way people in Casper, Wyoming view public art.  If anything, the program has taught Casperites that public art doesn’t have to be grand statues or huge murals. It can be transforming the ordinary, everyday objects into the extraordinary.  Art can be part of the daily grind, making us want to pause maybe just a little longer. "
ARTS & CULTURE,Harvey Weinstein's Hachette Imprint Is Shutting Down,"Weinstein Books has been shut down by Hachette Book Group, according to The Hollywood Reporter. In the wake of bombshell reports from the New York Times and the New Yorker detailing numerous allegations of sexual harassment and assault against Harvey Weinstein, Hachette has announced that the Weinstein imprint will be shuttered immediately. The Weinstein Books staff will be absorbed into Hachette Books, according to a statement provided to The Hollywood Reporter; its roster of upcoming books will also be published by the Hachette Books imprint. Weinstein Books, a joint venture between the Weinstein Company and the Hachette imprint Perseus Books, published a range of fiction and nonfiction, often by media figures and celebrities.  MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski, who signed a three-book contract with Weinstein Books earlier this year, stated over the weekend that she could not move forward with the books “until such time that he is no longer associated with the company.” Comedian Iliza Shlesinger, whose Weinstein Books title, Girl Logic: The Genius and the Absurdity, hits bookstores in November, published a statement on Instagram decrying Weinstein’s alleged acts while defending her decision to publish with the imprint. “Weinstein Books is an all female imprint that has, frankly, published many works about female empowerment written by strong women, ” Shlesigner wrote. “I ... can’t, in light of what has happened, vilify a company of women who have been supportive of me.” Prior to the announcement that Weinstein Books would shut down, Brzezinski also lauded the women at the imprint she’d worked with, but she raised questions not just about Weinstein’s continued role but the broader culture of the Weinstein Company. Following his firing on Oct. 8, Brzezinski wrote an article for NBC News stating she needed more to change before she went forward with her contract. “I want to know what’s going to happen, post-Harvey, what the status of women inside the company is and what else management knew over the years,” she wrote. “I want to do everything I can to make sure that they become a stronger, healthier company and have a very good environment for women.”"
ARTS & CULTURE,MacArthur Foundation Announces Its 2017 Class Of 'Geniuses',"From a reporter who’s dedicated her career to documenting segregation in America’s education system, to one of the first computer scientists to hack an automobile, to an artist who doubles as a counter-surveillance researcher, this year’s roster of MacArthur Fellows celebrates yet another year of exceptional human achievement. The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation announced the latest recipients of its annual MacArthur Fellowship ― frequently referred to as the “Genius Grant” ― early Wednesday morning. Nikole Hannah-Jones, Stefan Savage and Trevor Paglen are but three members of an impressive class of 2017 fellows, newly endowed with a $625,000 check and an accolade previously attached to icons like Susan Sontag, astrophysicist Joseph Taylor and musical tour de force Lin-Manuel Miranda. The MacArthur Foundation began doling out grants in 1981 in an effort to identify and extol high-achieving individuals in a wide range of disciplines. (The 2017 list of grantees counts a painter, immunologist, human rights strategist, urban planner and novelist among its two dozen-deep roster.) The once-$50,000 award has since ballooned into the six-figure, “no strings attached” grant we know today. There are no restrictions governing what recipients do with their fellowship bounty. This year, the fellows include nine women, 14 men and one gender-non-conforming individual, ranging in age from 33 to 63. See the entire list of new “geniuses” below. For more MacArthur Fellowship coverage, check out our interviews with grantees Rhiannon Giddens and Viet Thanh Nguyen. Jesmyn Ward is a 40-year-old fiction writer based in New Orleans, Louisiana, whose stories bring black, marginalized communities to the center. Her three novels, including Salvage the Bones (2011) and Sing, Unburied, Sing (2017), address brutal and often ignored realities including poverty, racism, addiction and incarceration with honesty, affection and rigor.  Gabriel Victora is a 40-year-old immunologist working in New York City. He adapted and perfected cellular imaging methods to better visualize the process through which adaptive immunity develops. His analysis of B cells yielded “the most definitive evidence to date that affinity maturation of antibodies occurs in a manner akin to Darwinian evolution,” a previously hypothesized but not ultimately proven conclusion that will benefit the creation of new and more potent vaccines.  Tyshawn Sorey is a 37-year-old multi-instrumentalist, composer, performer and conductor in Middletown, Connecticut. His singular practice straddles the line between improvisation and composition, collapsing boundaries between genres and traditions including Western classical, American and Ethiopian creative expressions, resulting in experimental, avant-garde arrangements that test the limits of musical performance.  Yuval Sharon is a 37-year-old director and producer of opera whose unorthodox performances ― often immersive and itinerant ― challenge the predominant understanding of what opera can be. His 2014 piece Hopscotch: A Mobile Opera for 24 Cars, took place in and around Los Angeles, with audience members commuting in limousines as singers and musicians emerged at various locations ― and within the vehicles themselves ― to tell a dynamic story within a living city.  Stefan Savage is a 48-year-old computer scientist whose interdisciplinary techniques address cybersecurity in the age of “smart” devices. Based in LaJolla, California, Savage recently demonstrated how an automobile could be hacked remotely and began working with car manufacturers to reduce security threats. His research in internet-related crimes, and the technological and cultural blindspots that enable them, prove critical in today’s constantly evolving technology landscape.  Damon Rich is a 42-year-old designer and urban planner whose strategies uproot the systems of oppression and discrimination embedded in cities’ layouts through predicaments like division, gentrification and environmental injustice. The Newark, New Jersey-based planner is known for his clever and sometimes witty approach to the field, as evidenced in his 2009 book Red Lines Housing Crisis Learning Center, which used the Queens Museum’s 1,000-square-foot representation of New York City to visualize the foreclosure crisis. His work invites citizens who are often disenfranchised to the forefront of conversations about urban design, bringing democracy to the city space. Derek Peterson is a 46-year-old historian and professor at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, where he studies and preserves East African texts, specifically in Gikuyu and Swahili, to challenge predominant narratives regarding colonialism and nationalism in Africa. Peterson’s research incorporates an unrivaled array of written materials, ranging from diaries and religious pamphlets to syllabi and dictionaries, which speak to the interplay of motivations, perspectives, traditions and contexts at play in these often overlooked materials.  Betsy Levy Paluck is a 39-year-old research psychologist at Princeton University concerned with destructive patterns of human behavior, including discrimination, bullying and ethnic conflict. Paluck’s field research, which has taken her from American high schools to post-conflict Rwanda, determined that, as the MacArthur Foundation describes, “to change behavior, it is more important to target individuals’ perceptions of social norms than their personal beliefs.” Trevor Paglen is a 43-year-old, Berlin-based conceptual artist and geographer who uses public records and declassified documents as artistic materials, exposing the alarming grip military and corporate power possess in today’s climate of mass surveillance. His practice includes the establishing of “limit telephotography,” which uses high-power telescopes and cameras to photograph secret prisons and military bases. Kate Orff is a 45-year-old landscape architect and founding principal of SCAPE, a Manhattan-based urban design studio that believes in urban landscapes’ ability to revive ecosystems, adapt to the difficulties posed by climate change and connect individuals. Orff collaborates with ecologists, engineers, educators, artists and community members to draw attention to the natural histories of specific regions, whether through infrastructure initiatives or podcast tours.  Viet Thanh Nguyen is a 45-year-old writer, cultural critic and University of Southern California professor who uses fiction to provide a “voice to the voiceless,” specifically by humanizing underrepresented minorities. His 2015 novel The Sympathizer is a spy thriller told from the perspective of a communist double agent in and after the Vietnam War. His stories offer alternative understandings of well-trodden American war stories, where marginalized voices are often obscured and erased.  Rami Nashashibi is a 45-year-old community leader and the executive director of the Inner-City Muslim Action Network (IMAN). The organization, based in Chicago’s South Side, works to provide health and wellness services, community organizing, criminal justice reform, arts enrichment and other services to low income residents. His Muslim Run Corner Store Campaign brought a wider selection of healthy foods to overlooked neighborhoods and eased racial tensions between the predominately Arab immigrant store owners and black patrons.  Taylor Mac is a 44-year-old, New York-based theater artist ― and at times a playwright, performance artist, actor and all three at once. Mac, who uses the gender pronoun judy, breaks down distinctions between highbrow and lowbrow art to toy with cultural assumptions about gender, performance and identity. judy’s 24-hour piece “A 24-Decade History of Popular Music” (2014–2016), explores the history of American popular music through a queer lens, highlighting the instances in which pop culture innovations have emerged as weapons against intolerance and injustice. Cristina Jiménez Moreta is a 33-year-old social justice organizer, as well as the co-founder and the executive director of United We Dream, a nationwide network dedicated to helping immigrant families based in Washington, D.C. Moreta came to the United States from Ecuador as a 13-year-old undocumented immigrant. She has since worked to put young people at the forefront of a strategic effort to challenge the stigmas undocumented youth face and enact the policy changes necessary to protect them from deportation and offer a pathway to citizenship.  Rhiannon Giddens is a 40-year-old singer, instrumentalist, songwriter, musical historian and activist based in Greensboro, North Carolina. Having trained as an opera singer before mastering the fiddle and five-string banjo, Giddens illuminates the overlooked influence of African-American artists to genres like folk and country. “I’m really interested in shining a light on those aspects of musical history that have been traditionally neglected and left behind,” she told the MacArthur Foundation. “Because I feel that our current situation can be explained by what’s going on culturally in years past that hasn’t been addressed.”  Nikole Hannah-Jones is a 41-year-old investigative journalist for The New York Times Magazine who often explores the effects of segregation on the American education system. Her work, including the 2016 article “Choosing a School for My Daughter in a Segregated City”, combines historical research and political analysis with first-person accounts, bringing the persistent reality of systemic racism and its pernicious effect on children and communities into sharp focus. Jason De León is an anthropologist at the University of Michigan who combines ethnographic analysis, forensic science and archaeological research in his work studying migration from Latin America to the United States. His 2015 book The Land of Open Graves: Living and Dying on the Migrant Trail, investigates the approximately 300 people a year who die attempting to cross the U.S.-Mexico border, often with no identification or belongings on their person. The work explores who they are, how they die and what happens to them afterward.  Emmanuel Candès is a 47-year-old applied mathematician and statistician at Stanford University. His research, as explained by The MacArthur Foundation, “focuses on reconstructing high-resolution images from small numbers of random measurements, as well as recovering the missing entries in massive data tables.” Candès compared the technique, which is applicable in fields from diagnostic healthcare to radar imaging, to inferring a customer’s Netflix preferences from the limited assortment of movies she views and rates. Dawoud Bey is a 63-year-old photographer and educator who creates deeply engaging portraits of individuals from overlooked communities and reimagines how cultural institutions can better serve the communities in which they are based. In 2013, the Chicago-based artist created “The Birmingham Project,” a photo series paying tribute to the six children killed in the 1963 bombing of the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church and its aftermath in Birmingham, Alabama. His more recent series, “Harlem Redux,” explores the transformative effects of gentrification on the historic black neighborhood.   Regina Barzilay is a 46-year-old computational linguist at the department of electrical engineering and computer science at MIT. Barzilay develops machine learning methods that enable machines to interpret human language and perform useful tasks. “One day machines can communicate with us in the same way we communicate with each other,” she told the MacArthur Foundation. Barzilay is currently exploring how machine learning can apply to the field of oncology, specifically in identifying trends that affect early diagnosis, treatment and disease prevention. Annie Baker is a 36-year-old playwright, based in New York, known for upending expectations of what kinds of people, language and situations are worthy of theatrical interpretation. Her 2009 production “Circle Mirror Transformation” takes place in a community acting class, in which five budding actors participate in exercises that illuminate elements of their interior selves. In 2010′s “The Aliens,” three amateur songwriters get high next to a dumpster, communicating primarily not through language but physical tics and cues.  Greg Asbed is a human rights strategist and a co-founder of the Coalition of Immokalee Workers and Fair Food Program (CIW) in Immokalee, Florida. For decades, the CIW has fought to improve conditions for low-wage workers and provide protections from sexual assault, wage theft and other abuses in the workplace. With his approach, dubbed worker-driven social responsibility (WSR), which has already spread from crop industries in Florida to the dairy industry in Vermont and garment industry in Bangladesh, he hopes to transform workplaces around the world.  Sunil Amrith is a 38-year-old historian in the department of South Asian studies at Harvard University. He studies migration in South and Southeast Asia, particularly in relation to the movement of people and goods across the Bay of Bengal, which has occurred for centuries and continues to impact culture to this day. His 2013 book Crossing the Bay of Bengal examines how climate and environment shape the lives of ordinary Indians, and his upcoming work will delve into how climate change ― specifically monsoons ― continue to alter South and Southeast Asian history. Njideka Akunyili Crosby is a 32-year-old figurative painter, born in Nigeria and based in Los Angeles, whose work combines techniques, media and subjects to visualize the hybrid reality of the immigrant experience. Crosby’s multimedia paintings invite viewers into her own intimate world, introducing them to her home and her family, to capture the global story of existing in between boundaries, cultures and traditions. At once accessible and incredibly dense, Crosby’s images offer textured representations of spaces, people and lives that fold in multiple perspectives and defy simple categorization.   Check out the 2016 class of MacArthur Fellows here."
ARTS & CULTURE,Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie Says The American Left 'Is Creating Its Own Decline',"Nigerian novelist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie has become famous in recent years for her outspoken feminism and social justice activism ― and she has strong opinions about how the left should regroup after the election of President Donald Trump in 2016.  The author of Americanah, who spends much of her time in America, said during a New Yorker Festival panel on Friday that she fears “the left in this country is creating its own decline.” Speaking to New Yorker editor David Remnick, Adichie critiqued the left, or at least, she hedged, “the left that is heard,” for failing to prioritize and work together for unity.  “I think the left doesn’t know how to be a tribe, in the way the right does,” she said. “The left is very cannibalistic. It eats its own.” “There’s something to be said, of course, for ideals, and I believe very much in that,” Adichie said. “There can be an extremist idea of purity. It’s so easy to fall afoul of the ridiculously high standard set there.” Here, Adichie spoke from self-described experience. Earlier this year, the author faced severe criticism from social justice activists and the trans community following remarks she made about trans women during an interview.  “I think if you’ve lived in the world as a man with the privileges that the world accords to men and then sort of change gender,” she told BBC Channel 4 in March, “it’s difficult for me to accept that then we can equate your experience with the experience of a woman who has lived from the beginning as a woman.” Adichie later clarified her remarks, stating at a public appearance, “There’s no way I could possibly say that trans women are not women. It’s the sort of thing to me that’s obvious.” She did not, however, apologize for the controversial statements, saying, “I don’t think I have anything to apologize for.”   Speaking to Remnick on Friday, she elaborated on her reaction, saying, “In the quest for inclusiveness, the left is willing to discard a certain kind of complex truth. I think there’s a quickness to assign ill intent.” Adichie argued that the left shouldn’t shout down disagreement, but respond with debate. “I’m just a person who thinks the answer to bad speech,” she said, “is more speech.”"
ARTS & CULTURE,Tom Gauld's Deceptively Simple Comics Hold A Mirror To Human Hypocrisies,"For all those people out there seeking an artist who’s able to poke fun at classic literature, narrative structure and human foibles in six panels or fewer, meet Tom Gauld. You might be familiar with him already, as his work regularly appears in The Guardian. His distinctive, simplified drawing style is both specific and accessible enough to be quickly digested and shared; by stripping a feeling or observation down to its barest elements, Gauld is able to speak volumes about modern politics, book culture and more. His comics are quippy, slightly sardonic takes that go down easy because they’re so darn cute — but will make you think long after you’ve left them. Literature nerds will identify with his newest collection, Baking with Kafka. In it are comics that lament the many ways readers lose their books (dropped in the bath, mauled by a baby, etc.) and offer ideas for murder weapons for modern mystery writers (“organic, locally-sourced cyanide”). He suggests keyboard shortcuts for novelists and over-specific bookstore categories (“thrillers by bearded writers under 5′6″”). It’s not just books he tackles — Gauld also turns a wry eye onto politicians, angry mobs, capitalism and conspiracy theorists, to name a few. Gauld shared his inspiration behind five comics from the collection with HuffPost. Of the above, Gauld writes that many guess that its about Donald Trump, but the cartoonist says that isn’t the case. “Trump is certainly a thin-skinned orange nitwit, but I can’t imagine him voluntarily going to an art gallery,” Gauld said. Read below to learn a bit about the inspiration behind his deceptively simple strips. This cartoon is about a particularly British love of petitions and dislike of “getting carried away.” Sometimes it can be tricky squeezing a story like this into such a small space, but in this case, I like that the people had to be so small, which I think makes them more sympathetic. I feel sorry for the revolutionary man, but in real life I’d probably be one of the other people. I drew this around the time of the Scottish independence referendum, when there was a lot of discussion about nations and borders. I tried to make the cartoon about the idea of nationalism and the silly myths that grow around it, rather than getting into specific political details. But that didn’t stop angry people on the internet telling me that I was saying that ISIS and the United States were exactly the same. I can’t remember which of the recent spate of U.K. elections and referendums inspired this cartoon, but in all of them it felt as if many politicians were using words in very misleading ways. This one is probably the most like a traditional, satirical political cartoon, and I think that’s because I was genuinely annoyed. I wrote a longer dialogue between the two characters in my notebook, but in the end decided to trim it down to a single exchange.  When I’m trying to come up with ideas for cartoons, I often make lists of words and ideas in my notebooks. I mix up sensible things with absurd things and, in a cartoon like this, edit them down so they play off each other in an interesting way. Then I can use the drawings to heighten the absurdity or expand on the idea. I drew this in January 2015 and was thinking about the way in which some people are all for free speech until somebody makes fun of the them or their beliefs. I had fun coming up with a set of mildly rude insults. The cartoon re-emerged online recently and a lot of people assumed it was written about Donald Trump. Trump is certainly a thin-skinned orange nitwit, but I can’t imagine him voluntarily going to an art gallery. Baking with Kafka is available now."
ARTS & CULTURE,'Mary Jane' Director Anne Kauffman Talks Darkness And Light In Life And Art,"If you’re lucky enough to get tickets to Mary Jane, a heartbreaking comedy by Amy Herzog now playing at New York Theatre Workshop, you may emerge from the experience as I did, exhilarated and shaken. A flawless cast led by The Leftovers’ Carrie Coon brings to gorgeously odd life the story of a mother whose devotion to her son breaks the limits of reason, bleeding into something either mad or profound. Pairing a deceptive lightness with fearless emotional directness, this exploration of the heights and depths humans are capable of is layered atop ordinary details of daily existence in a way that feels both familiar and startling. Mary Jane’s multiply award-winning director, Anne Kauffman, a cofounder of the Civilians theater group, has earned a reputation as a helmer skilled at creating the perfect stage language for boldly original works, including Detroit, Slowgirl and Maple and Vine. The director spoke with me by phone about past, present and future art. Congratulations on the exquisite production of “Mary Jane.” It's a miracle when everything comes together so magically. Have you had that happen a lot?  Anne Kauffman: No, I have not had that happen a lot. And we theater people are just, we’re after that rush, you know what I mean? We kill ourselves to get that, and it's so infrequent that it happens. You wonder how we can stand the rest of the time. What do you do when it doesn't happen—or do you always see glimpses of it? I think so. If it’s worth it, it’s pursued, then there’s something—it sounds Pollyanna-ish, but there's a part of it that feels like that, hopefully. I would say it’s more rare for me to feel that there's nothing redeemable about a piece. When did you first know that theater was for you?  I don’t think I’ve ever not known. I can’t remember, really, a time—I actually did stuff in grade school, and then I didn’t do any of it in high school, because I followed in my sisters’ footsteps—I’m one of six children, and I’m number five out of six, so I often say that probably my exhibitionism is a huge part of why I went [into it], and the need for attention. But when I was in high school, I was a cheerleader, I was in student government—I was one of those types. Your exhibitionism may have led you to the theater as an actor, but directing is selfless. You’re giving yourself over to others, serving everyone else, the writer and the actors.  But we also like control, which I realize is another part of my personality. I think I figured out in college that I wasn't the star, the musical theater star, that I hoped I would be. I also found I sort of lost interest—just focusing on one thing grew dull to me. Something about the challenge of being responsible for the entire orchestration of things was the thing that actually really kept me engaged, and satisfied my need to dig in and organize and orchestrate and bring a vision—whatever that vision was—to life. How did you come to directing? I took a class in undergrad, I'm not sure why—it was terrifying to me. It's still terrifying, directing is a terrifying pursuit. It's an impossible thing that we do, and it's way overwhelming, and it's really the reason to do it too, like I said, it's really the thing that keeps me fully engaged, to be overwhelmed. I don't really understand why I started doing it, but I think I directed something in my dorm [at Stanford], and then I took a class, and I remember very distinctly the professor pulled me aside one day and said, ""How does it feel to be a director?"" And I found that astonishing, just out of control. Like some sort of mantle had been placed on my shoulders that was both exhilarating and hugely burdensome. It was a very exciting moment. From school in California, how did you find your way to New York City?  I'm actually from Phoenix, Arizona. When each of us graduated from the eighth grade, my dad would take each of us, on our own, to our first trip back east, so he took us to New York City and Washington, D.C. And there were several things that we were put through in order to earn the trip. We had to memorize the preamble to the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, the Bill of Rights. This was in the days when you could actually walk up the Statue of Liberty, so every night we'd do squats in my parents’ bedroom to get ready to go up. And in New York, every night and every matinee, we went to go see a show. I remember really not liking New York City because we went in the summer when it was very humid and disgusting and crowded and horrible. But when I went to the theater I was just, I was 13 years old and I already had aspirations. We would go home to the hotel after the shows and I would cry myself to sleep. I was very passionate about it—despite the humidity and the disgusting pollution and the stench at that time—that was 1982. Is it strange to find yourself now doing the thing that transported you? I think about this so much. I think about that girl and I think about how hard, how challenging the road is to become a director, I think about that every single day. I’m never far from it–I feel very close to not making it. It’s so precarious, because there truly is no path. The path to director, each of us is creating our own path, we’re trailblazing our own, because no one’s getting there the exact same way. Particularly for women, it feels like it’s almost impossible to have opportunities. There’s more of us who are in a greater position of influence, but yeah, definitely, the ratio is not what it should be, that’s for sure. How did this project come to you? Is there some particular thing you look for in the plays you want to do? In this particular instance, Amy Herzog and I worked together on a play called Belleville a few years ago. I establish relationships with playwrights, so pretty much if someone like Amy Herzog—and Amy Herzog in particular, I would say—comes to me with a play, I’m pretty predisposed to say yes. She’s such an extraordinary writer and just an extraordinary human being. She’s a very sly writer, because it seems as though she’s a mainstream writer, but in fact she’s quite experimental. This play is extraordinary on so many levels: she’s playing with so many different levels of genre and consciousness and pursuit and text. She’s an astonishing thinker and writer. Honestly, I had no idea—I was like, “Okay, Amy, sure, let’s do this play, this is a difficult play, it’s a difficult emotional play.” And even I who know Amy very well can take her work at face value, when in fact it has nothing to do with face value. It all lives underneath. So I didn’t really know what I was in for. When we did this at Yale, we did the production that I thought was there, and we did it well. Revisiting it—it’s extraordinary when you know you’ll have another chance; to have that second chance, which we got with Belleville too—it flowered in a completely different way. My interaction with it and its profound effect on me—it opened up even more. You know, the high holidays were this past week, and I haven’t been to synagogue, it’s got to be 10 years. And this year, after working on Amy’s play and talking to a very particular rabbi about the Hasidic woman in the play, I was like, “I need to go to synagogue!” [Laughs] Because the play is actually in such complex pursuit of spirituality and what it is to become—who you were, who you are now, and what it is to become in your next iteration—it made me go to temple! I would get more meaning from the play than temple, but that’s just me. The combination of going back to synagogue and having a very particular experience there, and merging how I felt like our rehearsals were like a kind of philosophical rumination—combining what it felt like in the rehearsal room with these particular women talking about the stuff that we were talking about, in conjunction with temple—this is going to sound very crazy, but I actually figured out, finally, my interpretation of God. [After] many, many years of people being like, “Do you believe in God? Do you believe in God?” and [my saying], “There’s probably a higher power, I don’t know what it is,” but completely avoiding and avoiding and avoiding it, suddenly it was like, “Oh, that’s what it is!” And it’s very simple and very clear to me, and very reassuring. [Pause] If I tell Amy I found God going to temple because of the show, she’s going to laugh at me. I can see the play leading you to that conclusion. In essence it is a pure portrait of love and devotion. It’s so unwavering in its pursuit of what’s real, no matter how difficult; it looks it in the eye. One of the reasons Mary Jane is such a remarkable character is that she doesn’t flinch from anything. We’re accustomed to characters who are too cheerful in the face of horrors, we think of them as deluded, and Mary Jane is transcendent. She is fearless in everything she addresses, and naked in her emotions and honesty, and it leaves an indelible mark because it’s so powerful.  You just came off of directing Scott McPherson’s “Marvin’s Room” on Broadway. I remember seeing the original and thinking there were good things about it, but when I saw your production, I realized what a great play it is. I wasn’t prepared for how much I liked it, how both of your movie stars gave such beautiful performances, far beyond what I thought either was capable of. I didn’t even recognize the voices they were using, the lightness and the nuance—and of course the young man was remarkable. I know it probably did not do as well as it deserved to do. Did you feel a lot of pressure going into that production? Was it scary to go to Broadway? You know, it’s funny, it was not scary. It’s taken me a long time to get there. It’s also nonprofit Broadway, so it has a different kind of feel to it—I haven’t done commercial Broadway, so I don’t really know. But it felt like a very comfortable graduation. You know, I came to New York when Marvin’s Room was originally produced in New York—I like to think that both Scott and I made our move at the same time [laughs]. That genre of theatre, that’s what I was raised on, the kind of wacky sense of humor, with darkness. He’s not quite as strange as Harry Kondoleon, but I feel like he shares the absurdity. Grounded in emotion, addressing meaningful things. So I was very happy to do that. Of course, my tastes have changed, and my sensibility is different, but I love the idea that I’m someone who directs Amy Herzog’s play and brings that sensibility to a Scott McPherson play that was done in the ’90s—because that’s what that production was for me; I felt like I was exploring the more ruminatory aspects of it. Also, doing that play right before doing Mary Jane—actually, that play was sandwiched between the Yale production of Mary Jane and the New York Theatre Workshop production of Mary Jane, so I was sort of dumped into the deep end of caretaking, and women who are caretakers. Putting caretaking and disability at the center of a piece and looking right at it is something that we do not do in this country, and Scott McPherson, by gosh, he did that. He did. Laura Jellinek, who did the set for A Life and for Marvin’s Room and for Mary Jane, we were laughing, because we were working on two shows where a character who is ill is behind a wall. And what you experience are the reverberations of that human being who is so deeply loved by the people that we’re actually seeing roam around the stage. You see that person very much in the DNA of the people we’re looking at, but it’s not about that person, just like Mary Jane’s not about [her son] Alex, it’s about Mary Jane. If you could do anything at all, what would it be? I would like to revisit Spring Awakening, the actual play. The play is so much darker than the musical. It has everything that I love about the theater in it. Another thing I’m working on very passionately and diligently is to bring The Sign in Sidney Brustein’s Window, the Lorraine Hansberry play that I did in Chicago, to New York. It’s a beautiful play. I don’t know it at all. What’s your next adventure? I’m doing the next show at the New York Theatre Workshop, which is a theatrical concert called Hundred Days by the Bengsons, who are a husband-and-wife composing-musician team. And then we’re doing their next project at Ars Nova in the winter. They’re an extraordinary duo, and they make beautiful work. And it continues in the tradition of the darkness that I explore. The dark time we’re living in is so surreal. Each day somebody dies too young, I think, “Trump killed him/her,” because the added stress and aggravation and horror and anxiety, I just feel, is pressing down on all of us. Does it ever seem like doing art is a luxury we can’t afford in these dire times? I find that art is a pretty important part of the ecosystem of a society. I think of it as a necessity. I don’t think my work can change the world, but I think it’s a necessary part of the conversation. I said yesterday to a group of people: “I’m so lucky, because I’m not a policymaker, I don’t have to make policy, I don’t have to make decisions. But what I do do, what I’m committed to doing is presenting and reminding people of the complexities of who we are as human beings, so that when those policymakers are making those policies, that they remember, they look before they leap.” That is, I think, the role of art—to remember ourselves to us, and to complexify things that are so black-and-white. Certainly Trump is making things black-and-white. But in order to make a decision, things have to kind of come down to a black-and-white situation. Gradations of gray are a difficult thing, but they have to go into the decision-making. And that’s what I think art does. It remembers that."
ARTS & CULTURE,How AIM Became A Secular Confessional Box For A Generation Of Teens,"If you looked back at my AIM chat logs from before 2010, you’d find approximately a million chats that began exactly this way: Me: hiiiFriend: hiiiiiiMe: how’s it going?Friend: goooooodFriend: youMe: okayyyy Not that I didn’t mix it up. Sometimes there was this:  Friend: hiiiMe: hiFriend: what’s wrong? Or this: Friend: hiiiMe: heyFriend: how are you?Me: okFriend: just ok? There was nothing, on AIM, more important than whether I was doing better than okay, and you were doing better than okay. Signs that we weren’t doing better than okay: out-of-character punctuation, saying we were “ok,” setting a lyric from the Goo Goo Dolls as the away message. It was secular confessional booth, each of us waiting for permission from the other to bare our emotional wounds.  As my colleague Elise Foley put it: A fun thing on AIM was if someone said “how r u” you could just “ok” and without fail people would say “y just ok?” On today’s Internet, we no longer need AIM to talk to each other ― we have Twitter, Facebook, Slack, text, Whatsapp, Tinder, Musical.ly (probably). AIM will finally go offline in December, an announcement met with equal parts nostalgia and touching bafflement, among many, that it still existed at all.  AIM isn’t irreplaceable or unique, and many of the ways we communicate now are better, or at least equally good. But when I think back on the chat client, I’m specifically grateful for, and unsettled by, how it shaped me and others in my cohort. It offered us myriad secluded, empty spaces into which to pour our traumas, trivial grievances, heartbreaks and hopes; it gave us the opportunity and the safety to build emotional bonds with each other and learn how to hear each other. AIM was a place where you could open up for office hours, the subject being yourself. Or at least it was for me. When I was a young teenager, my brother helped me set up an AIM account. Not having gotten in on the wave of AOL chatroom trolling many of my peers enjoyed in their tweens, I had reached roughly high school age without grasping the thrill of having a digital alter-ego to chat with strangers. I wasn’t a popular kid, but had friends. I saw them at school and on weekends. Wasn’t that enough? The answer, of course, turned out to be “no.” Once that first account had been set up (periwinkle1492; a few years later I switched it to jammiriffic during a Lonely Island obsession), AIM consumed me. My family still had dial-up in those days, so I’d work through my 30-pound backpack of Algebra II and World History homework and wait for my dad and brothers to go to bed.  When I finally signed on, it was only to leave my AIM open and continue working; often I just wanted to experience that heart-in-mouth moment as my buddy list unfurled and I saw who was online. And then I was there, available, if perhaps my crush wanted to exchange soulful thoughts about Taking Back Sunday. Other nights I was swelling with hurt or irritation or self-doubt that needed to be lanced and drained into a friend’s chatbox, someone who would tell me how dumb my crush was to ignore me all day or how much everyone enjoyed my political rants.  Instead of rushed, restrained venting at our lockers, AIM helped us to debrief on the day of high school hell with luxurious privacy and expansive time. Instead of long phone calls, we could double and triple up on our personal conversations. AIM had a multiplying effect on intimacy. I could, and often did, have a long conversation with the guy I liked while simultaneously deconstructing it with a friend and chatting with another about her own drama.  AIM’s simultaneous private chats, incidentally, made three-way-calling obsolete. How simple, how foolproof to copy-paste chats from a crush into a chat with your friend. (Until, of course, you accidentally pasted it right back into that crush’s chat.) And then, oh, the hours of feverish analysis. He chatted you first! He typed “lol” when you made a joke!  Guys, AIM is shutting down! RIP the best typing class ever invented, aka chatting with your 7th grade crush for hours abt nothing. There was an availability to someone’s AIM chatbox that both opened up paths to intimacy and called for a careful etiquette. In a chat box, I might flirt with a guy I would be embarrassed to smile at in front of our classmates for fear of humiliating rejection. I might chat someone whom I’d never cold-call on the phone to shoot the breeze or send a long letter about my feelings, but if we sent each other the right signals ― “ok.” “just ok?” ― the next step was catharsis. The drive-by pleasantry of “how are you” meant something on AIM. What were we there for, if not to find out whether or not we were all doing okay? We were kids, and we were having a lot of hormonal feelings, and we knew we needed to talk about it. AIM just made it easy. I met the first person who I’d ever term, however briefly, my “boyfriend” on AIM, through mutual friends. He lived an hour away and we only hung out in person a few times, but we knew a vast sea of things about each other, the kind of secret and painful things too hard to share outside of a private little box. I also fell in love with my first real boyfriend on AIM; we developed a shorthand of spelling and punctuation tells so precise that a single period could immediately make it clear whether we were upset, and with whom. (We were learning how to be emotionally literate and supportive, but also, it turned out, emotionally reactive basketcases who could go into a tailspin over a typo.)  Once, in the midst of a break-up argument, we stopped talking. Tortured by the silence, I set a subtweet-y away message, then a series of them, all intended only for his comprehension. Somehow it never occurred to me that other people would also see them, and probably figure out what I was doing. In the world of AIM, even the self-evidently public felt private. AIM has been dying for a number of reasons, including the increasingly tragic uncoolness of my generation as we become corporate drone adults. For the AIM generation, chatting online has become deeply enmeshed with our work lives; we gossip in a Gchat window while anxiously keeping an eye on our email, and we list our employers in our Twitter bios. Twitter was inspired, to a degree, by the, ""away message"" in AIM. #RIPAIM But we also don’t need it in the same way. The duties of AIM have been diffused out through the landscape of communications technology. There are texts, group and non-group, for one-on-one cheerleading and emotional check-ins. There’s Twitter, or even Facebook, for the public or semi-public post meant to vaguely hint at angst or signal intellectual depth (or both). Twitter cofounder Biz Stone cited the AIM away message as a direct inspiration for his own startup. There’s Gchat and, increasingly, chat clients like Slack for professional and professional-adjacent conversation. By the time I found myself working for AOL, as a HuffPost editor and writer in my early 20s, I already found AIM embarrassingly passé.  All of the ways we talk to each other online now have been subject to tortured debate about whether they’re good for us or bad for us, and the answer is always both. Can a platform connect us to people who will listen to, encourage and support us? Well, it can also connect us to people who will mock, harass and torment us. Emotional power tends to work in both directions. (This, to be clear, does not excuse companies such as Twitter and Facebook from finding remedies for abuse on their sites.) AIM, too, offered access to secret friendships and secretive bullying ― though perpetrators could be blocked, at the very least. Even the fondest memories I have of AIM give me pause, in retrospect. I was a socially awkward girl, and my mother’s sudden death when I was 11 had left me in profound, suppressed grief. Those cozy, sheltered chat boxes offered me refuge and human closeness when I needed it. But they also offered me a crutch. I never had to be alone with my feelings, and one day, as an adult, I woke to realize that I didn’t know how. AIM had somehow convinced me that I’d always be surrounded by people asking me “how r u?” and carefully noting that I’d said, tellingly, “ok.” The conversation of adults IRL, I found, did not operate with such sympathetic detail; they don’t have the time or the will. The day finally came when no one was hanging around for hours each day to do nothing but engage with all my feelings about unemployment or the economy or even my new crush. That’s adolescence, after all. It’s a time for solipsism, for staring tirelessly at our own psyches and saying “what is that?” For millennials, AIM was the tangible embodiment of that coming-of-age phrase, and for that purpose, it was everything it needed to be ― and it also needed, eventually, to come to its end."
ARTS & CULTURE,Two Photographers On Bringing Local Stories To Our Nation's Attention,"Welcome to ”The Story We Share,” a series of Q&As that profile two people with similar identities ― but who live in very different places. As part of HuffPost’s Listen To America tour, we’re exploring how people’s lived experiences overlap and diverge depending on their zip codes. What is the “American Experience?” It depends where you look.  *** In August 2014, shortly after police officer Darren Wilson shot and killed an unarmed black man named Michael Brown, members of the St. Louis, Missouri, community took to the streets to protest police brutality and racial injustice in America. Three years later, in the same month, white supremacists and neo-Nazis marched on the streets of Charlottesville, Virginia, to protest the removal of a monument to Confederate general Robert E. Lee. When counter-protestors showed up, tensions escalated and turned violent, culminating in the death of an activist named Heather Heyer.  Both of these moments captured the attention of the nation. Photos of Black Lives Matter demonstrators alongside police in riot gear, as well as images of grieving UVA students juxtaposed with white supremacists bearing tiki torches, flooded social media. Despite not being physically present, people around the country got a sense of just how blistering, impassioned and significant these events were.  Eze Amos and Robert Cohen are both photographers who, in their own ways, have been telling the stories of their communities. Amos, born in Nigeria, lives in Charlottesville, where he works a day job as a wedding photographer. But his passion is street photography, specifically, capturing Charlottesville citizens in daily life. With his hashtag project #cvillepeopleeveryday, Amos hopes to balance the negative perception of Charlottesville that has lingered since the August rally by showing the love and unity that most residents believe in.  Cohen, who grew up in New Orleans, now lives in St. Louis, where he works as a photojournalist at the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Although his photos routinely depict community life ― from residents’ gardens to county fairs ― he is now known for capturing one of the defining images of the Ferguson protests. In the photograph a black man named Edward Crawford, wearing an American flag on his shirt, winds up to return a fiery tear gas canister to the police who threw it into the crowd. The canister sparkles and pops with golden flames that vanish into clouds of smoke. Cohen and the rest of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch photo staff were subsequently awarded the 2015 Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News Photography.  Below, Amos and Cohen discuss their lives and work, why they call their cities home and what it means to photograph their own communities.  Eze Amos (Charlottesville): I’m originally from Nigeria. I moved to Charlottesville nine years ago. It was a cultural shock, my first trip out of Nigeria. A lot of things were different, walking down the streets and not having people say hello to me. In Nigeria, if somebody looks like they’re older than you, you are almost obligated to greet them. Even random strangers will stop to greet you. If you do it here, people look at you. Now Charlottesville is home. It’s felt that way since I had my daughter. It’s a really beautiful place to raise a kid. Robert Cohen (St. Louis): I was born in Philadelphia, grew up in New Orleans. After school, I went to University of Texas, had a couple jobs in South Florida, then moved to Memphis, worked for the The Commercial Appeal for 10 years and came to St. Louis in 1999. My director of photography in Memphis took the same job in St. Louis and about a year later he encouraged me to come visit. I decided to give it a try.  Amos (Charlottesville): Charlottesville is a very happy place. People are really cool and kind and open. But I can’t disguise the fact that it’s the South. It’s Virginia. As a black person I can feel it. The downtown mall, it’s a beautiful place. I can walk up to anybody and strike up a conversation. But it’s not lost on me that I’m looking at everybody in the mall right now and I still haven’t seen a black person yet. It’s not any one person’s fault ― it’s how the city has evolved over time. But we need to try to put in more effort. I want to see more than the few black people I see here panhandling. So many black people are working three or four jobs somewhere like this with $12 lunches. It’s not designed for them. It’s a beautiful place but — it still has that. I feel very welcome here, I feel at home here. But I have had my own experiences with racism in this town. Cohen (St. Louis): It’s not the South, that’s for sure. St. Louis is a really nice place to raise a family. I wouldn’t describe it as the world’s friendliest place. It can be a difficult place to make friends. In the South, if you pass a stranger and don’t say hello, they look at you funny. Here, it’s not like that. Amos (Charlottesville): I used to work as a firefighter with the county. It was my first real experience face to face with racism; at that point, I didn’t even have a name for it. I got recruited with six or seven other people and, from the get-go, I noticed I was getting different treatment during the training. I tried to raise the issue with my supervisors, but they just kept telling me I should just do what I’m told. I was being drilled on stuff before I was trained on how to do it. Eventually they said, “You’ve been here for so long and you didn’t complete what we wanted you to.” This was back in 2012. I finally got the chance to speak with the fire chief and he expressed his regret and his disappointment at what happened to me. He asked me if I wanted to come back. I was the only black firefighter in the county. I didn’t know this, I was just two years into the states. I realized after I got fired, wow, I was treated different. That was my crash course. It opened my eyes. In a way I’m grateful that happened to me. It’s made me more aware. Amos (Charlottesville): I became interested in photography back in Nigeria. I grew up around storytelling. I grew up poor, we didn’t have power all the time. At night, without power, we’d just sit around a table and my dad would tell us stories and stuff. It started one day when I walked into the library, where I’d often work as a teenager as a lab technician. I walked in one day and saw a book of photography. There was this black-and-white photo of a dead dove lying on its back. It completely blew me away. I still pretty much only take photos in black and white because of that photo.  I used to draw, but I’d never held a camera in my hand before. I grew up in a very, very poor family. The idea of a camera was a luxury we couldn’t afford. I was lucky to find a friend whose dad’s old beat-up film camera was still in the garage. He dug it up for me and cleaned it off. I took my money and paid a repair man to fix it up and bought my first ever roll of film ― black and white. I couldn’t print the photos. I didn’t have the money, so I just kept collecting the negatives. When I came to the U.S. in 2007 with my rolls of film, the first job I got was at a camera shop. Finally, I digitized my film.  Cohen (St. Louis): I worked for our high school newspaper and, at the same time, I got a job at the local camera store in Metairie, Louisiana. There I was exposed to a lot of things. The guy who ran the photo lab there was the photographer for the New Orleans Saints. He would bring me to some of the games and let me shoot from the sidelines. It was my first taste that someone could make a living doing this. I decided to go to a college with a good student newspaper and journalism program. Cohen (St. Louis): I’ve dabbled in art photography here and there, but for me, it’s more about meeting people and telling their stories, documenting the world around us.  Amos (Charlottesville): The rap group Arrested Development has this song “People Everyday.” I’ve always loved that. I love how much story you can tell from people’s faces alone. If you take a photo of someone from a certain angle, with the light hitting a certain way, you can tell a million stories. It was scary at first ― walking up to random strangers and taking a photo. It’s one of the major things that keeps people away from street photography. It took me a while to be comfortable enough to stand right in front of someone, get on my knee, take a shot, stand up and go away. Cohen (St. Louis): Not really, no. Look, I love meeting people. I love telling stories about our community. You learn so much from just meeting anybody on the street. I’ve been working for a few days now on a story about a police officer and a social worker that teamed up to help the homeless. I guess what motivates them motivates me. You want to use your work to make a difference somewhere in somebody’s life. They want to help homeless people, provide them services and enroll them in programs. I want to have a similar impact in telling readers about our community.  Amos (Charlottesville): I’m a documentary wedding photographer. Charlottesville is a big wedding destination, so I take advantage of that. I try to do as little posed photos as possible. Most people don’t appreciate that until they see them. But they are paying for me to tell the story of their day. Cohen (St. Louis): This [working at the St. Louis Post-Dispatch] is a full-time thing. I don’t do a whole lot of freelance. We have seven photographers left at the Post-Dispatch. We’ll ride that last wave and keep going until we can’t. Cohen (St. Louis): We lose people constantly and it’s changed a lot in terms of the immediacy. With the website, we’re on a 24/7 news cycle and they want everything with more urgency. Back in the day, we’d be casually looking over images for the next day’s paper. Those days are gone. We are in the instant gratification news cycle. With breaking news, we sometimes send photos to our office straight out of the camera. With the new pace, I don’t see a whole lot positive change. You don’t get the time to get deeper and deeper into stories. We will still do projects, where we take an issue and spend a long time looking at it. We still do that kind of work. It’s just a little more rare than it used to be.  Amos (Charlottesville): I’ve always used social media. In the past year I began to focus on Instagram to showcase my street photography series #cvillepeopleeveryday. It’s encouraging to attract viewers from all over the world. I have been posting photos of local protests on Facebook for a few years and getting a lot of shares just across the local Charlottesville community. This was gratifying and made me feel like my work matters to my neighbors. After the terror attacks in Charlottesville, I used social media to push out my images of the resistance. It’s been amazing how some of these images have circulated all over the place, being shared through networks. The hashtag organizing tool has been huge. Cohen (St. Louis): Social media is huge. Part of my job is getting people to our site through any way possible. Twitter, which is the main social media I use ― I’m tweeting out photos, I’m tweeting out links. I’m trying to get people back to our website to use these stories.  Amos (Charlottesville): I’ve been following Jason Kessler since he started the whole push not to get the statue [of Confederate general Robert E. Lee] taken down a year and a half ago, or two years ago. It was a no-brainer for me. I was there for the KKK rally, which was something. It was awesome — in a bad way. I was scared. I didn’t know what to expect. I’ve never seen a KKK guy in his full robe before. When they finally came out, there was something about them that made them seem — eh. They had their robes and some of them were silky, flammable, like if somebody lit a cigarette they would catch fire. I was not impressed. The fear of standing in front of Klansmen was taken away from me when I actually saw them. I thought, oh, this is a bunch of scared, angry, white men. They were posing for cameras. They wanted to be on camera. Cohen (St. Louis): I’m always looking for people that are giving visual cues of their need to be heard, from Ferguson to what’s going on now. The protests are much more organized now. It can be kind of like Bill Murray’s “Groundhog Day,” where you see the same faces out there every day, marching on the same issues. It makes it challenging to find photos that haven’t been done before. Sometimes I’m looking for loud photos, sometimes I’m looking for quiet photos that might indicate these are the people who have been out here night after night after night. There were people arrested at the mall recently and protesters actually camped outside the county jail waiting for their release. We’re trying to cover it from as many sides as possible. There are still a lot of people that want to be heard in this community.  Amos (Charlottesville): The #cvillepeopleeveryday [project]. I’ve always been attracted to the documentary style and black-and-white photography. In my wedding and events business, I incorporate this style and seek out clients who want it, but the #cvillepeopleeveryday project is a place where I fully invested my passion for this work. I started this project before the attacks in Charlottesville, and I never expected it would actually turn into a space of healing for people. I’ve been sharing my images of ordinary life in downtown Charlottesville throughout the summer, alongside my images of hate and resistance. Now I’m having people reach out and thank me for capturing and reminding them of what they feel is the “real” Charlottesville ― not a whitewashed rebrand, but just ordinary people from all backgrounds living their lives day to day in a small city.  Cohen (St. Louis): For better or for worse, I am known in this industry for one specific image in Ferguson. That’s an image that everybody knows and everybody has some reaction to one way or another. The picture itself should have never been shot. We were all going home for the night and there was a turn of events and there it was. It happened. It’s kind of strange because it’s not really indicative of my work. I’m a community photojournalist and I’m much more likely to be seen at a July 4th parade or photographing plates of food for restaurant reviews. We’re doing much more community driven photojournalism and this looks like a war zone image. I don’t do that kind of work very often.  Amos (Charlottesville): Yes. My body of work this past summer has really resonated with people. I think it’s a lot of factors. It’s the fact that I’ve been documenting protest in Charlottesville for years, and protest locally has changed dramatically since the election. We used to be a town where you take your toddler to a small gathering of activists, gathering in solidarity with people being oppressed in other communities like Flint or Standing Rock or Ferguson, and speaking up to connect the dots with our local issues like gentrification or the lack of a living wage for university employees. Now we are ground zero for the national fight against neo-fascism. I’ve been able to live here through that transformation. I also think my style seems to resonate with people. I have a deep love of storytelling through portraiture, capturing the small details of facial and body expressions that reveal a person’s perspective and identity. Through practice, especially this summer, I’ve developed a very distinctive style, and I guess you could say I’ve found my voice. I’ve gained a lot of respect locally as a black immigrant photographer on the front lines. While that shouldn’t be the reason people attach to my images, the way I naturally see the world is offering a perspective that’s not always in the mix. Cohen (St. Louis): It’s changed a lot of things. I don’t know if it has changed my life, but it has definitely made me busier. A lot of people want to talk about it. It’s an important image a lot of people associate with the resistance. I’m happy to have been there in that moment.  People are still keyed in to issues of injustice. Even though we are talking about two different situations, with Michael Brown then and Jason Stockley now, people see it as the same story of racial injustice. The people that were marching in Ferguson in 2014, 80 percent are still out there today. I see the same faces every day I saw in Ferguson three years ago. It’s important for them to see we’re still out there covering this story. Whether we are out on the actual protest lines or doing stories on how the community has been impacted by the protests, we’ve gone in a lot of different directions. It’s amazing to me how much they’ve sustained this the whole time. I did a talk about Ferguson yesterday for the Federal Reserve Bank, and at the end of the talk I said, “If you’re interested in this subject, there is a protest forming right now outside of the building. It’s still going.” Amos (Charlottesville): Art can do a lot. I’ve always wanted to lend my voice in some way to fight racism, racial equality and economic inequality. I have not been able to find a way to do that. I am not someone who would want to be part of a rally carrying big signs. But I can be there to tell the story. I remember when Sandy Hausman from NPR asked me, before the KKK rally came to town, why I was thinking of risking my life going out there. I told her I want to be the one to tell the story of this community. A guy coming from D.C. or New York doesn’t know this city. They’re just like, oh, this small town. I know what this community has gone through. I would rather tell the story than let some random person do it. Cohen (St. Louis): I think I have always been fascinated by the captured moment in time. That, for me, is where still photography trumps all other visual sources. Knowing that people are going to remember these fleeting seconds. Amos (Charlottesville): Right now Charlottesville is filled with so much negativity. That is why I have been trying to push my #cvillepeopleeveryday project, to show average Charlottesville people. This city is full of normal, fun loving people and families. It’s just unfortunate these guys picked Charlottesville to push their agenda. Charlottesville is the base for them to push their message out. Cohen (St. Louis): I don’t think real deep about it. You want to have an impact on your community. You want people to have a new way to look at others ― at the homeless population, for instance. Everyone has a story. If readers see an image, maybe they’ll decide to go out and help. Or maybe when they see somebody on the street they won’t just pass them by. They’ll say hello and ask how they’re doing. I just don’t have any grandiose hopes of leaving any sort of legacy. I just like people to think about their fellow man a little more.  These interviews have been edited for length and clarity."

ARTS & CULTURE,Colin Kaepernick's Jersey Hangs In The Same Museum As 'Starry Night',"One of the most recent additions to the halls of New York’s Museum of Modern Art is a red San Francisco 49ers jersey. The same jersey worn by Colin Kaepernick between 2011 and 2016.  Kaepernick’s sports jersey hangs with four others featured in the ongoing MoMA exhibition “Items: Is Fashion Modern?”, which explores the impact of 111 carefully curated items of clothing and accessories on the 20th and 21st centuries.  The jersey is a unique item of clothing in that its uniform design conjures an almost immediate sense of power, promise and camaraderie. As MoMA curator Paola Antonelli and her curatorial team expressed in an email to HuffPost, “Children around the world look up to sports heroes as role models; for them, the jersey embodies a dream or aspiration.” Initially, jerseys were only worn by professional athletes, but in the 1970s, devoted fans began donning replicas of their favorite players’ uniforms. The trend eventually extended to the realm of streetwear, where jerseys became fashionable, independent of any specific athletic allegiance. Kaepernick’s jersey, the San Francisco 49ers’ number seven, became the best-selling jersey in the NFL’s official shop website in 2016 and remains one of the top selling items to this day. The stats are especially noteworthy seeing as Kaepernick no longer plays for the 49ers, or any other NFL team at present. The popularity of the uniform, then, illuminates the quarterback’s status not only as a star athlete but a contemporary icon of civil rights.  Kaepernick first sat down during the national anthem ahead a preseason game in August 2016, lowering himself in silent protest of the racial injustice plaguing the nation. “I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,” he told NFL Media of his decision. “To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.” In September 2016, Kaepernick took a knee instead of a seat, and has continued to do so ever since. The protest has been an unremitting source of inspiration, controversy and debate since its inception. Just last month, President Donald Trump criticized the gesture, while public figures including fellow NFL players, Stevie Wonder and former CIA director John Brennan expressed their unwavering support for Kaepernick and his demonstration.  After the 2016 season came to a close, Kaepernick opted out of his 49ers contract and has been a free agent ever since. Nonetheless, his red jersey continues to sell in massive quantities, a testament to the influence Kaepernick holds off the field as well as on it. His jersey embodies so much of the ongoing political conversation in this country today ― what America stands for, and what it kneels for.  “We hope that visitors to ’Items′ will see in these sports jerseys not only the blood, sweat and tears of their original wearers but also the complex synthesis of aesthetics, personal choice, collective style, politics, business, race, gender, marketing, labor and technology that are embodied by their reproductions,” Antonelli and her team wrote.  The other jerseys in the exhibition are Pelé’s 1958 FIFA World Cup Brazilian national soccer team jersey, Michael Jordan’s Chicago Bulls basketball jersey and the Black Ferns women’s rugby national team jersey. Athletic gear aside, the MoMA show will also feature garments including a little black dress, a keffiyeh, a pearl necklace and Levi’s 501 jeans.  “Items: Is Fashion Modern?” is on view until Jan. 28, 2018, at MoMA in New York.  Welcome to Battleground, where art and activism meet."
ARTS & CULTURE,Why I'm A Pittsburgh Street Photographer,"What’s the first thing you think of when you hear “Pittsburgh”? Passionate sports fans? Yinzers? Sandwiches with French fries? Style?  You may be skeptical of my last suggestion, and up until five years ago I would have been too. That’s before I decided to photograph and document the people of Pittsburgh on Keep Pittsburgh Dope, my Instagram page, which has since gained a following of over 19,000 people. Through this street photography, I became “woke” to all of the overlooked style and diversity that can be found roaming the Steel City. Our city is praised for welcoming driverless cars, cultivating a young new food scene and being one of the most livable places in the country. Yet we can’t seem to shake the stigma that our style isn’t keeping up (just ask GQ).  But I’ve learned, firsthand, that’s simply not the case. As a street style photographer in Pittsburgh, I have the freedom to capture the style I admire, and let me tell you, there’s plenty.  But unlike other cities, where style is so expected, in Pittsburgh we have to prove ourselves. We have to prove that as a city, we are more than just Antonio Brown jerseys and mismatched outfits, and that we really do take pride in our personal aesthetics. That’s why I feel a responsibility to showcase that style in a public way.  Of course we take pride in the things that have always defined our city, but it’s important for the new generation to know we have more to offer, so they too can take pride in PGH."
ARTS & CULTURE,How Arts And Culture Are Reshaping Charleston,"I appreciate HuffPost coming to Charleston, West Virginia in its exploration of life in communities throughout our country. While news coverage and a community forum focus on our biggest challenge (the opioid crisis that envelops so many communities), I’m grateful for the chance to share several of the great things about my hometown, West Virginia’s capital city. We are preparing for a brighter future in Charleston, with emphases on arts and culture, next generation innovators and creatives, tourism, recreation and hospitality. With an aging population and a regional economy that’s been based on extractive industries for a long time, I stress the need to base every decision we make on young people who hold the key to our economic and cultural future. Our goal each day is to make Charleston a more attractive place for people to live and visit, work and play, invest, innovate and create. We do that with a spirit of friendliness and a welcoming attitude: If you want to come and grow here, visit and explore here, create and produce here, you’re welcome in Charleston. We say that ― no matter what you look like, what you believe, whom you vote for and whom you love.  Our slogan, “Hip, Historic… Almost Heaven,” is about the aspirations of the creative class and is the brand promise that a visit to Charleston will be transformational. Soon after I became mayor in 2003, we intentionally increased the financial and human resources dedicated to arts, culture, special events and creativity.  FestivALL Charleston started in June 2005 as a weekend celebration of music, dance, drama and public art. Now FestivALL covers 10 days in June and several special events in every season of the year. Our artist community has been celebrated, empowered and strengthened as never before. Music provides the steady undertone of Charleston’s cultural progress. The founding executive director of FestivALL was Larry Groce, who has hosted Public Radio’s Mountain Stage from here since 1983.  The West Virginia Symphony Orchestra performs inside the state-of-the-art Clay Center for the Arts and Sciences and in outdoor concerts.  In addition, the Moses Auto Group Live on the Levee features free Friday evening concerts throughout the summer from the Schoenbaum Stage in Haddad Riverfront Park. We are blessed with dedicated citizens -– people working in our hospitality industry and folks involved in community organizations -– who follow their passions to promote a wide range of special events throughout the year and in every part of our city. For example, every October, about 1,000 classic cars fill our four-lane Kanawha Boulevard during the annual Rod Run & Doo Wop.  In August, West Virginia Games weekend features a Pro Watercross national jet skiing competition, EVP professional beach volleyball and several more sporting events in and next to the Kanawha River. The unique 15-mile Charleston Distance Run is one of dozens of races and walks that promote friendly competition and healthier living while promoting many different worthy causes. The West Virginia Power plays Class A professional baseball in Appalachian Power Park, which opened in 2005 and has hosted several hundred future Major Leaguers on the field. In addition to hosting concerts, sporting events and live theater, the Charleston Civic Center is undergoing a $100 million renovation project that will transform it into the top convention center in our state and region.  This major investment in our city’s top tourist destination followed nearly $100 million in private sector investments in the local hospitality industry, including new and renovated hotels, locally owned restaurants and the Charleston Town Center Mall. That’s pretty impressive for a city of our size! In addition to being a destination for visitors and tourists, Charleston is also a great place to start a wider adventure. Within an hour’s drive, adventure-seekers find world class whitewater rafting, zip lining, mountain biking and snow skiing.  That is why the national Boy Scouts developed the Summit Bechtel Reserve as the host for the National Boy Scout Jamboree every four years and the World Jamboree in 2019. As you can see, Charleston has a lot to offer people of every age who are looking for a special place to be and to enjoy. We also are fortunate to have key partners working with us to strengthen Charleston for the next generation with their unbounded sense of what’s possible. The University of Charleston opened its new Wehrle Innovation Center last December and recorded its largest enrollment in decades this fall. Following President Ed Welch’s vision, innovation is incorporated into every course of study within the university with emphasis on design thinking and promotion of entrepreneurship. A private institution, UC recognizes the value of innovation in an ever-changing, rapidly revolving and evolving world. This intentional focus on innovation introduces many of the best and brightest young minds from our region and far beyond to the university and our city. I could write much more about additional ways Charleston has become a more inviting and special place for people. But I’ll close with one final thing I love about our city: The progress I’ve highlighted has come because of tremendous bipartisan cooperation with our city council. We have a relatively large council, but we have never had a party-line vote in the 14+ years I have been mayor.  Our approach, to put Charleston first without regard to Ds, Rs or Is, could be a model for other levels of government, and that’s been a great blessing. I am grateful that you’ve taken time to read this and learn even more about Charleston.  If you chose to learn more in person, we will welcome you with our West Virginian warmth and hospitality anytime."
ARTS & CULTURE,Guggenheim Museum Pulls Controversial Animal-Related Art After Threats Of Violence,"New York City’s Guggenheim Museum announced on Monday night that three controversial artworks would be removed from the institution’s upcoming exhibition “Art and China after 1989: Theater of the World,” including the title piece of the show. The works, all by conceptual Chinese artists, came under fire last week when activists characterized them as “instances of unmistakable cruelty against animals in the name of art.” The criticism erupted after a measured preview of the show ran in The New York Times, titled “Where the Wild Things Are: China’s Art Dreamers at the Guggenheim.” The comments on the article, however, reflected the distress many experienced even before the show’s opening.  “I am beyond disappointed in the Guggenheim’s willingness to share the appalling treatment of animals,” one read. “These artists felt China was willing to toss them aside, but they are quite willing to throw animals aside. We are all in this life together, man and beast.” In the week since the article ran, a Change.org petition calling for the Guggenheim to remove the works on view attracted over 613,000 supporters, and protestors marched on museum grounds. Yet in a statement on Monday, the museum claimed that “explicit and repeated threats of violence” ultimately led to the works’ removal. A post shared by A R T C U B E (@artcube) on Sep 23, 2017 at 1:46pm PDT “Art and China After 1989” features avant-garde pieces from 150 Chinese artists working between the end of the Cold War and 2008. Themes of globalization, utopia, oppression, authority, violence, competition and control are prevalent throughout the show, with animals often symbolizing the debased human condition many endured during this transformative period in Chinese history.  One piece no longer included in the show is “Dogs That Cannot Touch Each Other,” originally staged in 2003 by married couple Peng Yu and Sun Yuan. In the performance, four pairs of pit bull-like dogs were strapped to non-motorized treadmills, facing each other. When the dogs attempted to run towards each other, they could not physically meet, mirroring a setup sometimes used to train dogs to fight. A seven-minute video of the 2003 performance was slated to be included in the Guggenheim’s exhibition. PETA president Ingrid Newkirk spoke out against the work. “People who find entertainment in watching animals try to fight each other are sick individuals whose twisted whims the Guggenheim should refuse to cater to,” she said. The American Kennel Club also released a statement, declaring, “Depictions of animal cruelty are not art.” Another contested work, the title piece of the show, is Huang Yong Ping’s 1993 “Theater of the World.” The work is a wood, steel and mesh dome equipped with heating lamps that can house hundreds of insects and reptiles inside, including locusts, crickets, beetles, centipedes, grasshoppers, geckos and cockroaches. The piece is arranged so that viewers gazing upon the work from above can watch as the creatures “devour” one another, as an initial press release from the museum outlined. A similar version of the work was also removed from view in Vancouver, British Columbia, in 2007, when the artist chose to pull the piece rather than comply with requests for him to remove scorpions and tarantulas from the mix.  “A lot of artists work with animals, and they have for a long time,” Alexandra Munroe, senior curator of Asian art at the Guggenheim, told Artnet. (She curated the “Art and China After 1989” exhibition alongside Philip Tinari and Hou Hanru.) “We are privileged to be in New York City, where we have the best of the best animal handlers. But these animals [in ‘Theater of the World’] were bred for pet consumption, and they are used to living in somewhat artificial environments.” A Guggenheim spokesperson previously reiterated to HuffPost that the museum staff worked closely with an entomologist, as well as reptile and insect care experts. “The insects were sourced in consultation with local experts; all are non-venomous,” she explained. “The reptiles have been selected and are cared for by trained professionals, including regular observation by a veterinarian.” The final piece on the chopping block is Xu Bing’s “A Case Study of Transference,” staged in Beijing in 1994. In the original piece, a live boar and sow had sex in front of an audience. The animals appeared covered in temporary tattoos comprised of nonsensical text in Roman lettering and invented Chinese characters. At the Guggenheim, the museum planned to omit the live performance element, and instead show a video of the Beijing performance.  In a statement released on Monday, the Guggenheim announced its intention to remove the three aforementioned works, not because of the content of the works themselves but “out of concern for the safety of its staff, visitors, and participating artists.” The institution expressed sadness that recurring threats of violence made the decision necessary. “As an arts institution committed to presenting a multiplicity of voices, we are dismayed that we must withhold works of art. Freedom of expression has always been and will remain a paramount value of the Guggenheim.” It’s unclear what the recurring threats of violence against the museum entailed, or who is behind them. Sarah Eaton, a Guggenheim spokesperson, declined to give specific details to The New York Times, noting only that “the tone in both the petition comments and the social media postings, calls and emails was markedly different from what we’ve seen before and required us to take the threats very seriously.” As a result, some art critics and gallerists have taken issue with the Guggenheim’s “undefined” statement. “It’s just surprising that there was no call to see the side of the artists,” Mohini Dutta, a transmedia designer at Syracuse University, told the Times. “It’s sad, but not surprising that a populist institution like the Guggenheim caved, instead of using it as an opportunity to have a larger dialogue about consent, living props and uncomfortable art.” Representatives for the Guggenheim did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. UPDATE: Sept. 28 ― The National Coalition Against Censorship released a statement condemning the Guggenheim’s decision to remove the works, as well as the violent threats that led to the decision. The statement reads in part: The Guggenheim’s alarming action continues a growing worldwide trend in which threats of violent protest are silencing artistic expression and posing a danger to free speech in general. Whether or not the provocations of artists are defensible or morally unacceptable, we need to take an uncompromising position against threats of violence. When cultural institutions cave in to such threats, others who are convinced of the moral rectitude of their cause are encouraged to embrace similar tactics. This time it is animal rights activists. Next time it could be religious or political extremists. Cultural institutions need to work with law enforcement to protect their staff, the public, and the works on view and to ensure that the right to protest does not override the right to free expression. Every time threats of violence succeed in silencing expression, fear’s stranglehold on the imagination tightens, stifling our ability to fully explore the world and our place in it."
ARTS & CULTURE,5 Reasons To Encourage Your Kid To Read Banned Books,"By Regan McMahon, Common Sense Media What do The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, The Catcher in the Rye, The Great Gatsby, Native Son, To Kill a Mockingbird, Fahrenheit 451, and The Adventures of Captain Underpants have in common? At one time or other, someone has tried to ban them from classrooms and public or school libraries. The American Library Association (ALA) ― champions of free access to books and information ― launched Banned Books Week in 1982 to celebrate the freedom to read. Libraries, bookstores, publishers and teachers across the country use the week ― this year it’s Sept. 24-30 ― to highlight great books that people have banned and to spark a discussion about censorship. At Common Sense Media, we think reading banned books offers families a chance to celebrate reading and promote open access to ideas, both of which are keys to raising a lifelong reader. Why do people ban books? Often it’s for religious or political reasons: An idea, a scene, or a character in the book offends their religion, sense of morality, or political view. Some folks feel they need to protect children from the cursing, morally offensive behavior, or racially insensitive language in a book. Or they think a book’s content is too violent or too sexual. The Civil War novel The Red Badge of Courage has been banned for its graphic depictions of war. The edgy teen best-seller The Perks of Being a Wallflower (Stephen Chbosky) has been banned for its descriptions of sexual behavior and alcohol and drug use. Profanity and an explicit scene featuring oral sex got Looking for Alaska (John Green) on the banned list. And Sherman Alexie’s The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian has been banned for religious irreverence, discussion of masturbation, and offensive language, including the N-word. Who’s challenging these books? Parents, school board members, individuals, groups ― yet what’s considered offensive may depend on the era or specific community. As the ALA argues, these challenges pose a threat to freedom of speech and choice ― freedoms that Americans hold dear and are worth standing up for. Here are five good reasons for kids to read banned books: 1. Today’s edgy is tomorrow’s classic. Original work pushes boundaries in topic, theme, plot and structure. What’s shocking today may be assigned in English class five or 10 years from now if it has true literary merit. The Great Gatsby is high school staple today, but was shocking when its gin-soaked pages were published in 1925. 2. There’s more to a book than the swear words in it. Many books have been banned for language that your kid has encountered before or will soon. Even potty humor (like in Captain Underpants) has caused people to call for a ban. A character’s language may add realism to the story, or it may seem gratuitous or distracting ― your kid can evaluate. 3. Kids crave relatable books. Banned books often deal with subjects that are realistic, timely and topical. Young people may find a character going through exactly what they are, which makes it a powerful reading experience and helps the reader sort out thorny issues like grief, divorce, sexual assault, bullying, prejudice and sexual identity. The compelling teen rebels story The Outsiders has been banned, yet many middle schoolers cite it as the book that turned them into a reader. 4. Controversial books are a type of virtual reality. Exploring complex topics like sexuality, violence, substance abuse, suicide and racism through well-drawn characters lets kids contemplate morality and vast aspects of the human condition, build empathy for people unlike themselves, and possibly discover a mirror of their own experience. Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry is an eye-opening story of an African-American family facing racism in 1930s Mississippi, yet it’s been banned for having racial slurs. 5. They’ll kick off a conversation. What did people find so disturbing in a book that they wanted to ban it, and to what extent was it a product of its time or did it defy social norms of its era? For example, Harry Potter was banned by people who felt it promoted magic. Reading a challenged book is a learning experience and can help your kids define their own values and opinions of its content.

ARTS & CULTURE,"NYC's Guggenheim Museum Under Fire For Show With Live Reptiles, Film Of Dogs Strapped To Treadmills","UPDATE: Aug. 26 ― The Guggenheim will not be showing the three animal-related works that have sparked protests, the museum announced Monday.  PREVIOUSLY: New York City’s Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, commonly called The Guggenheim, is facing accusations of animal cruelty over an upcoming show that includes an arena where live reptiles and insects will “devour each other” and a video of dogs strapped to treadmills. Those exhibits are slated to be part of the museum’s October show, “Art and China After 1989: Theater of the World.” The exhibit features more than 150 pieces of art by more than 70 artists, the vast majority of which are not sparking any backlash. However, three pieces in particular are attracting criticism from animal welfare activists. The piece that’s gotten the most negative press is “Dogs That Cannot Touch Each Other,” by controversial artist duo Sun Yuan and Peng Yu. When they first staged the piece in 2003, four pairs of pit bull-type dogs were brought to the Today Museum in Beijing and strapped onto non-motorized treadmills at close proximity, facing each other — similar to techniques sometimes used to train fighting dogs. A post shared by Sophie Gamand (@sophiegamand) on Sep 21, 2017 at 11:37am PDT The Guggenheim’s exhibit will not involve live dogs in the flesh — it’s a video of the 2003 performance, the museum emphasized in a statement. The Guggenheim described the piece as “an intentionally challenging and provocative artwork that seeks to examine and critique systems of power and control.” Peng has previously defended the piece, saying that the dogs were not being abused because they are “naturally pugnacious” — an oft-repeated stereotype about pit bulls. The New York Times article on the exhibit, however, describes the dogs tethered to the treadmills as being frustrated, getting “wearier and wearier, their muscles more and more prominent, and their mouths increasingly salivate.” Animal welfare activists say that the video itself is unethical because of how it was created, and the way it depicts pit bulls. “[The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals] opposes the use of animals in art if such practices produce pain, injury or distress to the animals,” said ASPCA president Matt Bershadker in a statement to Pix 11. “The video perpetuates the false stereotype that pit bulls are only purposeful as vicious dog fighting instruments, not as what they are at their core: affectionate and loyal animals who crave our attention and deserve safe and loving homes.” Two other exhibits under fire include a video featuring mating pigs covered in ink, and the show’s titular piece ― an installation involving live reptiles and insects, some of which will die during the show. The Guggenheim describes “Theater of the World” by artist Huang Yong Ping as “a caged arena shaped like a mythological tortoise, hundreds of live reptiles and insects devour each other over the course of the show.”  A Guggenheim spokeswoman told HuffPost that one section of the installation will house leopard geckos, Italian wall lizards, millipedes, crickets, cockroaches, grasshoppers, and two types of beetles. A second will contain corn snakes and sulcata tortoises. “The Museum staff worked closely with the artist as well as with an entomologist and reptile and insect care experts,” she said in an email. “The insects were sourced in consultation with local experts; all are non-venomous. The reptiles have been selected and are cared for by trained professionals, including regular observation by a veterinarian.” She added that lighting will be appropriate to help the animals acclimate to their environment, and that their feeding is managed by “trained experts.” It was not immediately clear what the museum’s initial press release meant when it said the reptiles and insects would “devour each other.” Versions of the piece have been shown all over the world, and it has sparked controversy multiple times, including when the Vancouver Art Gallery removed the installation in 2007 after Huang refused to let them make some alterations at the recommendation of a veterinarian. Huang argued in a 2015 interview that the installation isn’t cruel, saying it’s no different from pet stores selling bugs as food for other animals: I was trying to present a metaphor through these creatures, not to emphasize their cruelty. I was presenting a case in which the bugs represented different kinds of people who supposedly cannot exist together, and raising the question—what would it be like if they coexisted? Hence the metaphoric title Theater of the World. I believe that this artwork is about raising such meaningful questions, not illustrating so-called cruelty. An online petition calling for the removal of the exhibits involving animals had garnered more than 160,000 signatures as of Saturday afternoon. This article has been updated with comments from a Guggenheim spokeswoman."
ARTS & CULTURE,"Jay Duplass On Why Straight, Cis Men Need 'Transparent,' Too","Since its debut in 2014, “Transparent” has brought marginalized stories to the center ― most notably, stories of queerness, transness and gender fluidity. In a talk last week at The Paley Center, creator Jill Soloway, who identifies as gender nonbinary, reiterated her show’s standing goal of “centering otherness” and allowing “queer people, trans people, women and people of color” to be protagonists in their own narratives. Through Maura, Davina, Shea, Ali and Sarah, viewers get to know human beings who are trans, queer and questioning; who are strong, courageous and loving, but can be selfish, destructive and imperfect, too.  Yet with the character of Josh, played by Jay Duplass, “Transparent” also chips away at the monolithic idea of what straight, cisgender male sexuality is. And while Hollywood surely isn’t lacking in stories revolving around white men, nuanced representations of their uncertainty, vulnerability and trauma when it comes to sex are far more rare.  Duplass describes his character, the middle Pfefferman child, as a “playboy who cries his ass off.” Internet vernacular might dub him a fuckboy, or his more sensitive sidekick, the softboy. Yet Josh’s tangled knot of emotional needs and sexual desires indicate there’s more brewing within him than shallow portrayals of a flailing womanizer suggest. With Josh, “Transparent” refuses to frame heterosexuality as the standard, simple and straightforward foil to queerness’ other. Instead, the show provides each of its characters with a fluid and ever-evolving network of desires and fears. “I think men are taught that they’re supposed to have sex with as many people as they can,” Duplass told HuffPost over the phone. “He’s learning from society what a man should be and sort of flip-flopping around the typical narratives we’re supposed to buy into.” Warning: Spoilers below for viewers still watching “Transparent” Season 3! As Josh, Duplass hopes to show that although cis, white men hold immense privilege and power, their identities are not by default established or “normal.” “I want to help every single human being be more fully themselves,” Duplass said. “If boys are allowed to cry we’d probably have a lot less war in this world. Let your boys cry, please.” And this sentiment of de-centering the straight, cis experience extends beyond what viewers see on TV. “Transparent” is as trans-inclusive backstage as onscreen, with over 50 trans cast and crew members and additional trans extras. In a rare turn, white men like Duplass were a minority on the show’s set. “I didn’t realize for a while that I was in the minority as a straight, white, cis male on set,” he said. “But I never felt otherized because, although Jill is creating an environment where trans people are put at the center, they’re not doing it to the detriment of anyone else. Because of the scene that Jill sets, we all just feel like we’re humans there to unfold ourselves and see what comes about.” Josh grew up differently than many men in America, in part because, as a kid, he was surrounded by spirited and curious women. “At the root, Josh was raised in a house full of strong women,” Duplass said. “The one person in his house he thought was a man turned out to also be a woman. It all sort of begins with this question of — what does a man do, how does a man behave? And him not having a proper role model for it.”  Josh’s first sexual experience, and seemingly his most formative one, was an affair with his babysitter, Rita, which began when Josh was 14 and Rita was 20 and persisted for years in secret. At first, Duplass hypothesized, teenage Josh was thrilled to be hooking up with a hot older woman. “In his mind, it made him the coolest kid in school,” Duplass said. Only later did he come to question the power dynamics behind the relationship and whether it is even possible for a 14-year-old boy to give consent. Legally, it’s not. “This season Josh comes to realize he was pretty much owned by Rita on some level,” Duplass said. “It started out as the thing that made him cool and, 20 years later, it’s the thing that’s imprisoning him, even though she’s deceased.” (Rita jumped to her death in a shopping mall at the end of Season 3.) In response to his adolescent relationship’s crooked power dynamics, Duplass surmises, adult Josh seeks out sexual exchanges that he can control ― he pursues music groupies who unflinchingly adore him and young women who look up to him. “What it really comes down to for Josh is that there has always been a clear power structure in his relationships, whether he is on bottom or he is on top,” Duplass said. “The Rabbi is the first time he has an age-appropriate partner and a relationship that did not have a power dynamic immediately built in.”  In the first episode of Season 4, Josh attends a sex and love addiction meeting with his sisters Sarah and Ali. An unnamed man in the circle, wearing a baseball cap and dog tag necklace, shares his story. “I’ve been thinking about my past, all the people I’ve been with and all the sex I had when I was young,” he said. “And it was mainly because people wanted to have sex with me. I wasn’t even really wanting it, but I felt like obliged to do so. And it wasn’t that I didn’t know how to say no. I felt like if my body is responding, it means yes. The thing that just occurred to me, which is going to sound weird, but it feels like a revelation: that maybe an erection is not consent.”  The revelation is radical, especially to Josh. “That’s brilliant,” he immediately responds. Just as “Transparent” chips away at hackneyed understandings of queer sexuality, so too it overturns tired notions of masculinity. Regardless of how characters identify their gender and sexuality, their wants and needs are depicted as complicated, amorphous, unfinished and in flux. There is no “normal,” and there is no “different.” We’re all, basically, beautiful messes.  Josh’s main narrative arc in Season 4 probes his relationship with Rita, specifically the question of whether or not Josh was molested. Her memory haunts his subconscious and her image follows him throughout his daily life. “So now, you’re a victim,” her ghost taunts as Josh prepares to enter the addiction meeting. It’s all happening, of course, in Josh’s mind. “The word molested, it doesn’t sit right with him. I don’t think he felt coerced at any point to have sex,” Duplass explained. “To him, the word molested is a box to be checked. It’s part of our binary culture, the way we name things.” In his adult life, Josh struggles to maintain a healthy, vulnerable, romantic relationship, though, as Duplass sees it, he fiercely yearns for one. Josh’s experience as a straight, cis man is in no way comparable to the discrimination and oppression characters like Maura face on a daily basis. However, the forces that endanger and minimize Maura’s experience might benefit Josh superficially, but not emotionally.  “I think every element of our culture deserves the ‘Transparent’ treatment, which I see more broadly as destroying the binary ― a reductive, medical checkbox rendering of humanity,” Duplass said. “Essentially binary means either/or, black or white. It pits people against each other. I think we can all be more unified and celebrated in our own ways if we just let go of the boxes that need to be checked and celebrate the complexity of the human spectrum.”  “Transparent” is available for streaming on Amazon starting Sept. 22. "
ARTS & CULTURE,What Happens When A Big-Name Author Is Sued For Copyright Infringement,"It’s the ninth inning of a championship baseball game. Our hero steps up to the plate ― one runner on, two out. Strike one. Strike two. This is his moment: Can he make his mark on the field? Here comes the pitch.   This is the climactic moment of n+1 editor and writer Chad Harbach’s The Art of Fielding, a critically well-received 2011 novel that arrived on shelves after a splashy sale at auction for over $600,000 followed by a media blitz. Earlier this year, The Hollywood Reporter announced that IMG and Mandalay Sports Media are developing a film adaptation of the book.  A ninth-inning, last-strike clutch championship moment also comes at the climax of Bucky’s 9th, an unpublished novel and screenplay by Dallas restaurateur Charles C. Green. Though this may seem like an unremarkable coincidence, born of baseball narrative clichés, Green is now alleging in a lawsuit that the works contain substantial similarities beyond those genre tropes that show Harbach lifted concepts from Green’s unpublished manuscript while revising The Art of Fielding into a literary darling. For example, take what happens once the conventional ninth-inning spotlight is turned on the protagonist. In both novels, the lawsuit claims, the baseball prodigy leans into a risky close pitch and gets whacked, a less-than-triumphant moment but sufficient to get the go-ahead runner on base. Filing a copyright infringement lawsuit against a well-known author is bound to draw attention, but what are the suit’s odds of success? Many in the literary world were immediately skeptical of an unpublished author claiming that his manuscript had been pillaged for plot points by a more successful novelist. There are, after all, millions of books, most unpublished, and some are bound to have similarities ― even remarkable ones.  Jess Taylor, an editor and former agent who worked with Green on Bucky’s beginning in 2004, told HuffPost in a phone conversation that he worked with authors in the past who’d gotten “all up in arms because she or he was sure that something had been misappropriated. And every single time I would look at it or my colleagues would look at it, we would come pretty quickly to the conclusion: No, this is what genre does.” The case of Bucky’s seemed different to him. “The books as they proceed become more alike rather than less alike,” he argued, saying that past books he’d read with shared premises diverged over the course of the narrative rather than converging.  The suit’s extensive and detailed list of alleged coincidences has raised doubts among observers already. “Reading the list of accusations feels fairly damning,” Silvia Killingsworth wrote in The Awl. Still, she added, “who in their right mind would lift elements from an unsuccessful manuscript in order to magically [...] make a successful one?” After Bucky’s 9th had been sent out to numerous publishers in the mid-aughts, none of them bit. The Art of Fielding, which was sold a couple years later, sparked a bidding war and ended up a bestseller. Critics praised the depth of the characters and the compelling prose while noting that the plot closely adheres to sports-novel clichés. Taylor told HuffPost that he and Green have shown their material to many neutral third parties. They spent several months in 2012 compiling a side-by-side analysis of the books’ similarities, Green says. “Everybody arrived at the same conclusion, which is not ‘aha, caught red-handed,’ it’s rather, there’s something very curious here,” Taylor said. “It becomes increasingly statistically unlikely, the way the patterns are replicated.” Harbach’s agent and publisher have maintained in statements to BuzzFeed that nothing nefarious took place. “Little, Brown and Company believes there is no merit whatsoever in the lawsuit against Chad Harbach over his book The Art of Fielding,” read the statement from his publisher. “Themes of coming age, sports and the college experience are hardly unique, and it is curious to us that this claim is being asserted now, six years after publication of Mr. Harbach’s book.”  From a copyright law standpoint, said Andres Sawicki, an associate professor at the University of Miami School of Law who specializes in intellectual property law’s effect on creativity in the arts and sciences, the case looks to be a mixed bag, even in a legal environment that’s been increasingly friendly to claims like Green’s in recent years. “I’d be really surprised if the plaintiff here won,” he told HuffPost in a phone conversation. But that doesn’t necessarily mean the case will be going away quickly. “My sense is that there’s probably enough here to get through” pretrial stages, like document exchanges and depositions, he said ― and possibly even to trial, if a settlement isn’t reached.  As the lawsuit moves forward, Green’s team has to prove more than a suspicious level of similarity between the books. A copyright infringement case like this one, Sawicki explained, requires the plaintiff to prove that their work has been copied, by showing that the defendant had access to the original and that substantial similarities between the two works exist.  “You have to have actually had access to the original work in order to have copied from it,” Sawicki said. “If I’ve never read your novel, there’s no way I could have copied it.” Green’s lawsuit claims that Harbach would have had access to his unpublished manuscript, since his agent sent Bucky’s 9th out to major publishers between 2006 and 2008. Harbach, the lawsuit argues, “had a wealth of contacts in the literary world,” and one of his co-editors at the literary magazine n+1 was a fiction editor at a publisher to which Green’s novel had been submitted. “I think that’s where this case is ultimately going to fall apart,” Sawicki said. ”[Green] has this challenge of showing Harbach actually read the book. It’s easy when it’s published. You can draw inferences.” But Bucky’s 9th was not published. “This is what we call weak evidence of access,” he said. Still, Sawicki explained, the more similarities found between the two works, the less evidence of access is necessary to make a case. If two works share a huge, convincing amount of plot points or details, access could be assumed based on the sheer impossibility of such coincidence.  In addition to detailing how Harbach might have encountered Bucky’s 9th, the lawsuit lists dozens of similarities in plot points, character details, relationships, and themes, some, to a layperson, eyebrow-raising (such as the climactic beaning) and some eye-roll-worthy (such as a female lead wearing lilac).  But that’s not all, said Sawicki. The plaintiff will also need to prove improper appropriation; basically, that the defendant lifted original, creative components of the original work. “If all the similarities are the generic, stock parts of that kind of work, it doesn’t matter,” he said. Both books, as baseball novels (and, indeed, stories in general) tend to do, rely heavily on stock characters, tropes and well-worn plot lines. For example, both climactic moments taking place in the ninth inning wouldn’t support a claim of improper appropriation. “The big thing happens in the ninth inning?” said Sawicki. “That’s every baseball book, ever. That’s the inning where something happens.” The improper appropriation case will need to rest on shared narrative turns or other details that are not part of the standard set of tropes found in baseball novels ― or the other genres both books share, like the campus novel. According to Harbach’s team, the suit’s allegations will be easily rebutted. His agent, Chris Parris-Lamb, told BuzzFeed in a statement, “[Harbach] has dozens of time-stamped files of the novel from the years he worked on it, which will show that the ‘uncanny parallelisms’ Mr. Green cites were in place as early as 2004, many from its very conception in 2000, and numerous classmates, professors and writing group peers can attest to this fact.” Parris-Lamb declined to comment further to HuffPost.  In a 2016 Medium post on the situation, Green alleges that a third party viewed a 2004 iteration of The Art of Fielding ― his University of Virginia M.F.A. thesis, which is available at the university library ― and found that the version didn’t contain “the salient shared material.”  Green maintains that all he really wants is to be able to publish his long-gestated novel, even by self-publishing, without inviting suspicion of plagiarism due to the close parallels between his and Harbach’s books. He is represented by Pieter Van Tol, an attorney specializing in insurance law at Hogan Lovells. Van Tol is also a former high school classmate of Green’s. “My objective throughout has simply been to get the cloud removed from my book, for my book not to appear derivative of his,” Green told HuffPost in a phone conversation. If Harbach has evidence that he simply came up with the same ideas independently, Green says, he wants to see it. “If he were to have been cooperative a few years ago and produced drafts that were verifiable that showed that this is just one big coincidence [...] then I would be able to tell people, agents, publishers, ‘Look at this crazy coincidence.’ That’s an OK solution for me,” he said. “Another OK solution is, he doesn’t, and something nefarious took place.” UPDATE: July 13 ― On July 9, 2018, a Manhattan federal judge dismissed Green’s suit against Harbach, writing in his decision that “the works are not substantially similar.” Green told Vulture that he intends to appeal."
ARTS & CULTURE,"Merriam-Webster Isn't Trolling You, It's Just Redefining What That Means","Language is a living, evolving thing ― and when our society moves in ugly directions, so must our language. Merriam-Webster just added hundreds of words to its online dictionary, including an online-harassment definition of “troll” and several others that remind us of America’s sorry state. “Troll” had a life before 4chan and Reddit: It used to be a whimsical term for a folkloric monster, or even a verb for searching or fishing. Now, the first action it suggests, at least to Internet users, is, as Merriam-Webster puts it, “to antagonize (others) online by deliberately posting inflammatory, irrelevant, or offensive comments or other disruptive content,” or “to harass, criticize, or antagonize (someone) especially by provocatively disparaging or mocking public statements, postings, or acts.” Trolling has become such a pervasive issue online that it’s inarguably spilled into the real world ― take the racist Pepe the Frog memes and other far-right online trolling, which helped spread white supremacist sentiments that ultimately bolstered Donald Trump’s presidential campaign. That leads us to another word just added to Merriam-Webster.com: “alt-right.” The newly dictionary-approved term doesn’t mince words in its definition, which calls it “a right-wing, primarily online political movement [...] whose members reject mainstream conservative politics and espouse extremist beliefs and policies typically centered on ideas of white nationalism.” It’s a vague-sounding term, and is alternately denied and embraced by its purported leaders, like Milo Yiannopoulos. When we think about rightwing trolling and Pepe the Frog memes, we’re usually thinking of the “alt-right,” basically a white supremacist movement gestated on message boards and propagated through deliberately inflammatory memes.  The political definition of “dog whistle” also made the cut at last, though it’s perhaps less relevant than it’s been in a while. Merriam-Webster defines it as “an expression or statement that has a secondary meaning intended to be understood only by a particular group of people.” Often, the secondary meaning is derogatory or damaging toward a marginalized group, while the apparent surface meaning of the statement provides political cover against charges of racism or sexism. For example, politicians might rail against food stamps ― while their real mission is to gin up outrage among white listeners that poor, non-white Americans are eating up tax dollars.  In the era of the “alt-right,” which often flaunts its racist messages, dog whistles might no longer be the only way to insert bigoted ideas into the mainstream political discourse, though they’re still frequently deployed.  That’s not to say that all the new Merriam-Webster words are grim reminders of our current political swamp. We also welcome “sriracha” and “pregaming” ― what could be more fun than that?"
ARTS & CULTURE,Canoe Found After Hurricane Irma Eyed As Piece Of Florida History,"Hurricane Irma left a lot of destruction in its wake, but it may have also unearthed a piece of history. A wooden canoe that scientists say could be hundreds of years old has reportedly emerged from the bottom of the Indian River along Florida’s eastern coast following last week’s powerful storm, leading some to speculate that it could have once belonged to Native Americans. Local Cocoa photographer and self-proclaimed history buff Randy Lathrop said he was riding his bike along the river earlier this week when he came across the unusual piece of wood washed up near the shore. “As soon as I saw it, I knew exactly what it was,” he told ABC News. The narrow piece of wood resembles a dugout canoe, which are made of hollowed out cypress trees and long used by Florida’s Seminole Indians, among other tribes, according to the University of Florida. Though some have been found dating back to ancient times, others have been used and recreated in recent years. With a truck picking up storm debris nearby, Lathrop said he quickly went to work to protect the item from being thrown out by calling the Florida Bureau of Archaeological Research, which sent an archaeologist over to examine the find on Thursday. But it will take time before more information can be gleaned about the canoe’s age, with carbon dating results expected to take weeks, the Florida Division of Historical Resources reported on Facebook. “It is maximum several hundred years old and minimum probably several decades old,” the government office stated in a post that described the boat as 15-feet long, several hundred pounds and with paint markings and square-cut iron nails. Sarah Revell, a spokeswoman for the office, noted the significance of the nails. “Cut nails were first in production in the early 19th century so that helps to indicate it is a historic canoe,” she told ABC News. Lathrop described the paint’s colors to the Pensacola News Journal as red and white, which he noted are colors used by the Seminole tribe. Though it has several uncommon features ― including compartments, its square shape, what appears to be a seat, and its nails ― it’s not especially unique. That’s partially because of the high number of dugout canoes found in the state, the office said. “Florida has the highest concentration of archaeological dugouts in the world with more than 400 from the state,” the office said. “Wooden artifacts like canoes are only preserved in constantly wet environments or constantly dry environments. Because Florida is so wet, it has an environment conducive to preservation of wood.” In order to preserve the item, it has been placed back in a wet environment. “If it is determined to be historic, the canoe will be stabilized, preserved and hopefully it will ultimately be displayed locally for the public to enjoy and learn from,” the office said. That end result is one Lathrop said he looks forward to. “History saved, for the public,” he exclaimed on Facebook. "
ARTS & CULTURE,Twitter Calls Out Museum Curator For Saying Asian Names Are 'Confusing',"A social media campaign to get people interacting with museum curators has revealed one museum curator’s bias against Asian culture and history. And those who noticed the tweet are calling the museum out. The British Museum is getting dragged for saying Asian names can be ""confusing."" pic.twitter.com/q9qJ2r47FN The British Museum on Wednesday participated in #AskACurator, a Twitter hashtag generated to let people submit questions to exhibit curators about their work. Using the hashtag, the Maas Museum in Sydney, Australia, asked the London-based museum how it makes labels for exhibits “accessible to a wider range of people?” A curator identified as “Jane, Keeper of Asia” responded by saying their curators write labels based on the topics they specialize in, which are then edited by an Interpretation department. The British Museum aims “to be understandable by 16 year olds,” Jane explained. Then she provided “confusing” Asian names as an example ― a move that made a lot of Asian people uncomfortable. “Sometimes Asian names can be confusing, so we have to be careful about using too many,” Jane wrote. “We are limited by the lengths of labels. Dynasties & gods have different names in various Asian languages,” she continued. “We want to focus on the stories.”  Jane, Keeper of Asia: Curators write the labels based on their specialist knowledge and they are edited by our Interpretation department ... https://t.co/b1nP0CQ0fS ... We aim to be understandable by 16 year olds. Sometimes Asian names can be confusing, so we have to be careful about using too many. We are limited by the length of labels. Dynasties & gods have different names in various Asian languages. We want to focus on the stories Many people were concerned with the British Museum’s response and called the curators out for limiting the number of Asian names they use just because they thought Asian names were confusing. you: Asian names are hardyou: I love the music of Tchaikovskyyou: Schwarzenegger movies are greatyou: my fav Targaryen is Daenerys Jesus. Confusing to whom, your white patrons? Haven't you stolen enough history? It wasn't confusing enough for you to colonise Asia, but it's too confusing for you to write Asian names. Okay, British Museum. https://t.co/NkKrNS0e76 Shockingly the British Museum inadvertently reveals it is run by white people from a former colonial power https://t.co/ZLgeuEtZr4 ""Sometimes European names can be confusing, so we have to be careful about using too many"" #SaidNoMuseum #Anywhere #Ever If they can pronounce names like Tchaikovsky or Pavarotti, they can pronounce Asian names. Lololol. Classic Imperialist right there. You go ahead and stay on brand, England. ""Take everything, use what I want, & throw out the rest."" Yeah might as well just erase our whole confusing histories for an easy life eh https://t.co/VfbCZVufOe The museum later apologized for the initial response and clarified Jane’s point by saying she was speaking only to objects that have multiple Asian names. But the reasoning she used for doing so is a bit problematic. While that practice of using the least-confusing Asian name might make the curators’ jobs more convenient, it holds Asian history back from reaching wider audiences. This is especially concerning when done in a place dedicated for people to learn about the world’s diverse history. Moreover, the assumption that Asian words would turn off young people prevents young people from learning about Asian culture ― and it shows that the museum’s main target audience is likely non-Asian or non-minority groups. The practice also reinforces a norm that already exists in many western societies: Asian culture is exotic, abnormal and not worth learning if it’s too difficult to comprehend. Despite the backlash, some people defended the museum’s handling of Asian names, arguing that the space restrictions are difficult to work around. The amount of people jumping all over an admittedly poorly worded/expressed Tweet is as hilarious as it is pathetic. Especially when... ... they haven't the faintest idea about the wider issue of making labels accessible, clear and straight to the point. The amount of... ... info visitors can take in from labels and text panels is very limited. I know. I've written and edited text for exhibitions and ..... ... its a constant trade-off. Supplemental resources and tech are the only way this can be achieved. Responding to the outrage from Jane the curator’s tweet, the British Museum issued an apology in a series of statements that further explained the point Jane was trying to make. The museum clarified Jane’s initial response by saying she was talking specifically about “label-writing” ― which has limited space for letters ― and including “multiple names” for a single feature. “The challenge with label-writing is not about whether people are able to understand or pronounce unfamiliar names, it is a question of whether we give multiple names to the same place/period/person in one label,” the museum said. In another statement, the British Museum maintained that their labels tell the “object’s story” and “essential information” about it. “We are not always able to reflect the complexity of different names [for example] periods, rulers, gods in different languages and cultures on labels,” the museum wrote, adding that in-depth information is provided in other museum programs and digital content. Apologies, we would just like to add some further clarification here: pic.twitter.com/t9xnJ8rJ3S In response to some of your questions today, we feel it's important to address a few final points about object labels: pic.twitter.com/ArrSEROGFr The debate over the British Museum’s labeling practices continues to wage on over Twitter. But amid all the outrage and arguing, one thing is for certain: The tweet has sparked a much-needed discussion about how museum curators — the gatekeepers of history — treat the histories of minority groups."
ARTS & CULTURE,Here Are The Y.A. Novels And Children's Books Longlisted For A National Book Award,"The kids are doing all right, at least when it comes to brilliant and politically relevant reading material. The National Book Foundation released the longlist for its 2017 Award for Young People’s Literature on Tuesday, unveiling a lineup of ten books that feature a panoply of diverse characters and stories. The smash hit The Hate U Give, a Y.A. novel by debut author Angie Thomas inspired by Black Lives Matter, appears on the list, as well as the latest novel by Coretta Scott King Honor recipient Jason Reynolds. Several of the listed books explore immigrant experiences, including I Am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter by Erika L. Sánchez. Here’s the entire 2017 Longlist for the National Book Award for Young People’s Literature (descriptions via the National Book Foundation):   “Told from a young age that love is not unconditional, [Nina] must come to her own conclusions when, despite her utter devotion, her boyfriend breaks up with her in this unflinching coming-of-age story.” (Carolrhoda Lab / Lerner Publishing Group) “A young woman adopted at birth goes in search of her biological siblings. Raised as an only child, she discovers that life as the middle of three will challenge her conceptions of family bonds.” (HarperTeen / HarperCollins Publishers ) “Two teenage laborers [...] learn that even the purest love is not without consequences.” (Algonquin Young Readers / Workman Publishing Company ) “Two Bengali sisters struggle to adjust to life in the U.S., with their search for identity spanning three generations of family women.” (Farrar, Straus and Giroux Books for Young Readers / Macmillan Publishers) “A young man contemplates revenge for his brother’s murder on a 60-second elevator ride that becomes increasingly crowded with ghosts from the past.” (Atheneum / Caitlyn Dlouhy Books / Simon & Schuster) “Julia, the daughter of immigrant parents, attempts to chart her own path for her life despite her parents’ suffocating expectations and the lingering shadow of the sister she has recently lost.” (Alfred A. Knopf Books for Young Readers / Penguin Random House) “Nine orphans on an idyllic island [...] must decide if the unwritten rules of their home should take precedence over their individual desires.” (Walden Pond Press / HarperCollins Publishers) “Sixteen-year-old Starr Carter[’s ...] two worlds — her poor black neighborhood and her affluent suburban prep school — are thrown into confusion when she witnesses the killing of her childhood best friend by a police officer.” (Balzer + Bray / HarperCollins Publishers) “A young boy who runs away from home to search for the music that was lost after the unexpected death of the grandfather he idolizes.” (Amistad / HarperCollins Publishers) “Young Fabiola Toussaint must navigate a costly freedom in Detroit after her mother is detained by immigration during their move to the United States.” (Balzer + Bray / HarperCollins Publishers)   The shortlist will be announced on October 4, and the winner will be revealed at the National Book Awards on November 15. But for now, it’s safe to say, these are 10 titles every children’s book fan should check out."
ARTS & CULTURE,Previously Unpublished Kurt Vonnegut Stories Arrive In The Nick Of Time,"“This collection pulses with relevance,” Dave Eggers writes in the foreword to Complete Stories, a soon-to-be-released collection of Kurt Vonnegut’s short fiction that’s set to include five never-before-published stories by the Slaughterhouse Five author. The eagerly anticipated book, edited by longtime Vonnegut associates Jerome Klinkowitz and Dan Wakefield, hits shelves on Sept. 26. Arriving a decade after the prolific writer’s death, the historic survey of Vonnegut’s work brings his affecting cultural criticism ― and empathetic storytelling ― back into the spotlight. Having lived through the politics of World War II and the ensuing Cold War, the contentious U.S. interventions in the late 20th century, the rise in xenophobia and religious intolerance following 9/11, and an alarming surge in climate change denial throughout, Vonnegut’s writing explodes with disquieting warnings and lessons that continue to ring true for contemporary readers. His “moral stories,” Eggers adds, “tell us what’s right and what’s wrong” about the way we choose to live. “The satisfaction we draw from seeing some moral clarity, some linear order brought to a knotted world, is impossible to overstate.” All in all, Complete Stories consists of 97 short stories written over the course of his career spanning 1941 and 2007 ― five of which were only recently unearthed. “As a longtime Vonnegut scholar, Jerome knew there were some unpublished stories,” Wakefield told HuffPost. Heeding Klinkowitz’s advice, Wakefield went to the Vonnegut Archive at The Lilly Library in Bloomington, Indiana, last summer, and found several versions of a story called “The Drone King,” among other rarely seen and unfinished works. “Most all of Vonnegut’s stories were published in the 1950s and all but a very few were written in that decade, as well as the early ’60s,” Wakefield explained. Famous Vonnegut tales like “Welcome to the Monkey House” (1968) and “Harrison Bergeron” (1961) spin off the horrors of pharmaceutical dystopia and governmental egalitarianism gone wrong. “The Drone King,” recently teased in The Atlantic, is less fantastical, but appropriately reminiscent of Vonnegut’s ability to infuse delightfully bizarre scenarios with a dose of societal relevancy.  “Some of the later stories in the early ’60s reflected cultural changes,” Wakefield said. “One story published in 1963 in Redbook magazine told of a woman whose life changed when she read a new book called Woman, The Wasted Sex, which was modeled on Betty Friedan’s The Feminine Mystique, which was published that year.” Complete Stories stands as the first comprehensive gathering of Vonnegut’s far-reaching body of short fiction. Like Eggers, Wakefield agrees that there’s a certain power to the works being released today. “I think the same basic ethical questions exist today as they always have ― honesty, loyalty, betrayal, fame and fortune versus your own standards,” he qualified. But one thing in particular has changed dramatically since Vonnegut’s short story-writing heyday: the overwhelming income gap between the rich and poor.  “Kurt was always for the underdog, for the downtrodden, and his favorite quotes were from ‘The Sermon on the Mount’ and the words of his fellow Hoosier, Eugene V. Debs: ‘As long as there is a lower class, I am in it; as long as there is a criminal class, I am of it; as long as there is a soul in prison, I am not free,’” Wakefield said. “It would be nice for people today to be reminded of the ethics those words are based on,” Wakefield concluded. “Young people have always appreciated Vonnegut, and find in his words new ways of looking at the world, and these stories will continue to awaken their curiosity and their sense of possibility.” Complete Stories by Kurt Vonnegut will be available on Sept. 26 courtesy of Seven Stories Press."
ARTS & CULTURE,How The Hell Do You Appraise A Crappy Drawing By Donald Trump?,"In July, a cursory sketch of the Manhattan skyline sold at auction for nearly $30,000. Why? Because Donald Trump made it.  Trump created the Sharpie-style drawing in 2005 for a charity auction benefitting global literacy. It depicts ― rather crudely ― the New York City skyline with a single, telling adjustment. In reality, Trump Tower is the 64th tallest skyscraper in Manhattan, but in Trump’s artistic interpretation, it dominates the view. Last month, the drawing was auctioned off by the Los Angeles company Nate D. Sanders. It sold to an anonymous bidder for over three times its starting price of $9,000. Since the sale, the owner of a rather similar drawing, also signed by Donald Trump, submitted the piece to Barnebys, an auction search and evaluation service, to see whether any auction houses would be interested in selling the drawing and what, approximately, it was worth. The answer to the first question was a resounding “yes.” The second was a bit more complicated.  Barnebys describes itself as the “Google of the art world.” People can use its database to search through works for sale at over 2,000 auction houses worldwide. They can also use the site’s resources to determine or estimate the value of certain works before they hit the auction block. As you might imagine, it is particularly difficult to appraise the value of a drawing like Trump’s.  “These kinds of things are hard to put a value on,” Pontus Silfverstolpe, co-founder of Barnebys, told HuffPost on the phone. “It’s not like Trump is Picasso.” Sure, Trump lacks Picasso’s artistic acumen. But more practically, he lacks a rich historical oeuvre which could help give context to the valuation of his work. When appraising a piece by an artist like Picasso, Silfverstolpe and his colleagues can base its price on the success of his other works, as well as with the prices of artworks made in a similar movement, era or set of conditions.  For Trump’s artistic endeavors, however, there is hardly any frame of reference whatsoever, which leaves a looming question mark. “It’s hard to know before the auction,” Silfverstolpe said. “It can be a wild guess.” The only real comparison, he explained, is that other Trump drawing, which sold for $29,184. That’s the general ballpark Silfverstolpe imagines the sketch in question will sell for, although it could go for far more.  This is not to say that Trump is on the same creative level as other emerging and established contemporary artists whose work sells in the $30,000 range. “It’s not about the quality of the painting, but the person who made it,” Silfverstolpe said. “If it was made by someone else, it would cost, best case, not even a hundred dollars. To be honest, the quality is not that good.”  However aesthetically unexceptional it may be, though, the drawing was made by one of the most powerful men in the world. And its subject matter, a city that is intimately connected with Trump’s persona and narrative, bodes well for the work’s value. “If he would have painted an apple, there wouldn’t be the same interest,” Silfverstolpe said. “It wouldn’t be so him.” Trump is far from the first politician to dabble in the fine arts. Former President George W. Bush painted portraits of 98 wounded veterans of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars for his book Portraits of Courage.  According to Barnebys, a painted called “Butterflies” by former President Jimmy Carter sold for $525,000 at auction earlier this summer. In 2016, a similar Carter painting depicting crabapple blossoms sold for $750,000, a record for the 39th commander-in-chief.  Similarly, a signed painting by Sir Winston Churchill, titled “A View From Marrakech,” sold at Christie’s in 2008 for $752,000. The work was estimated to sell for between $556,000 and $834,000. Another Churchill piece, titled “Villa on the Nivelle,” went for $702,000 three years later.  Trump’s black-and-white sketches are significantly less involved than the oil paintings of his political predecessors. In fact, Silfverstolpe specified that Trump’s drawings align more so with the collectible market than the art market, comparing the image to a baseball signed by Joe DiMaggio. “It’s interesting to see how much we’re willing to pay to get a glimpse into that celebrity life,” he said. Although Silfverstolpe guesses the piece will sell for around $30,000, if not more, the high price tag doesn’t suggest that Trump should pursue a future in the arts by any means. In the art expert’s professional opinion: “It’s not that good.”"
ARTS & CULTURE,Amazon Exec Suggests Publishers Could Promote Books By Slashing Prices,"Want people to buy your books? Try selling them for a song. That was Amazon’s advice this week to U.K. book publishers. According to The Daily Mail, and relayed by The Bookseller, the online retailer’s head of publishing, David Naggar, told publishers that they could see success by mimicking the low sales prices offered by self-published authors on the platform.  “What self-published authors will do is they will publish a book and sell it for 99p right out of the gate,” he said. “Publishers [with new authors] could much more afford to do that than self-published authors.” But why would publishers slash their own prices so dramatically? While book publishers might pour resources into a debut author’s book tour, free review copies and even ad campaigns, Naggar suggested they could make those books more appealing by simply lowering the consumer’s barrier to entry.   “I look at price as a tool for visibility,” he explained. “You can either spend a lot of money on marketing or you can invest it in a super-low price until they get the flywheel going of the recommendation engines ― and this is just for Amazon.” Readers, he said, would be more likely to pick up a book from an unknown author if it were cheaper, and these early readers might generate enough buzz to goose sales of the book. An Amazon spokesperson told HuffPost, “The comments in question were used very much out of context and were made to illustrate an example of Kindle Direct Publishing authors’ tactics to drive discovery. The conversation was about how to maximize sales for unknown authors.” The tactic might sound simple, but there’s an obvious downside for publishers: Using books as loss-leaders for themselves can degrade customer expectations of what books are worth ― and though Amazon, with its iron-stomached investors, can afford to keep cutting prices and losing money on its business, most branches of the publishing industry cannot. Publishers don’t simply create books out of the ether, but invest significant resources in them, and prices are calculated to allow publishers, as well as booksellers, to recoup their business costs. In addition to authors, publishers must pay editors, designers and production workers who collaborate to turn out a product, as well as sales and publicity staff. More than one or two dollars’ worth of labor goes into producing a new hardcover, or even a new ebook ― and by selling brand new books to consumers at that rock-bottom price, publishers would risk creating the expectation that books will sell for that unsustainable price in perpetuity. This has already effectively happened with ebooks, which publishers initially tried to sell for similar prices to hardcovers; Amazon undercut prices radically, and it’s now expected that ebooks will cost between $10 and $15. Once again lowering prices to tempt readers would seem likely to have the same result. It may not even help with promotion, as Naggar suggested. An anonymous indie book publisher told The Bookseller that “price alone doesn’t make much of a difference to sales,” unless it’s combined with good promotion. “But Amazon decides what ebooks to promote ― not publishers ― which is a bit of a problem,” the publisher said. Naggar’s reported statements don’t indicate that Amazon plans to pressure book publishers to lower their prices; the strategy is presented as an option that might help publishers garner attention for little-known debut authors. But if publishers are skittish about such suggestions from the online retailing giant, they have reason.  Amazon does have the power to put book publishers in the impossible situation of sacrificing their profits on book sales or sacrificing their sales altogether: According to MarketWatch, the online retailer controlled 93 percent of e-commerce for books in 2015. And Amazon has a history of wielding that power ― for example, during its famous dispute with Hachette over ebook pricing, when the online retailer removed Hachette titles from pre-order and two-day shipping availability and even made books harder to find in search results. Economists and anti-trust experts have warned that Amazon has been given a pass by regulators because they use their immense market power to lower prices ― but its growing clout in the market still positions it to harm producers and interfere with future innovations that might disrupt its business model. In June, Lina Khan critiqued Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods in The New York Times, noting, “Reports chronicle how executives tinker with recommendation formulas that determine whether customers see certain goods, turning algorithms on and off as retailers watch sales flow and dry up, Amazon’s hand on the spigot.” Since the Hachette debacle of 2014, Amazon seems to have backed off and achieved a tenuous truce with the major U.S. publishers. But the company still holds a lot of cards, not to mention the power to stack the deck. As long as that’s the case, publishers will continue to watch Amazon’s book-selling strategy like hawks."
ARTS & CULTURE,"Tina Fey's 'Mean Girls' Musical Has Its Plastics, And An Official Release Date","Get ready to soak up the awesomeness that is Tina Fey’s “Mean Girls” musical, because it officially has a release date.  Broadway’s “Mean Girls” will open Sunday, April 8, at the August Wilson Theater in Midtown Manhattan, with previews beginning March 12. American Express presale begins Sept. 10; tickets go on sale to the general public Tuesday, Oct. 3 (get it?).  A pre-Broadway run will start at the National Theatre in Washington, D.C., on Oct. 31 through Dec. 3.  Fey, who announced that the sought-after musical was finally going to become a reality back in March, co-wrote the show, and Lorne Michaels, Stuart Thompson and Paramount Pictures are behind the production.  Entertainment Weekly shared a first look at the actresses portraying the infamous Plastics ―Taylor Louderman (Regina George), Kate Rockwell (Karen Smith) and Ashley Park (Gretchen Wieners) ― and the ladies do not disappoint. “It’s similar to the experience I had with the movie, where you watch someone like Rachel McAdams and you think, ‘Oh, she made this. She’s such a great talent that she’s actually making this more than is on the page,’” Fey told EW. “When you have great actors, like we do now with these young women, they bring more to it than you even imagined.”  “There are lots of things you can do better in a musical,” Michaels told The New York Times. “The characters are fuller.” A press release description lets fans know that the show will stay true to the hit 2004 high school comedy starring Lindsay Lohan and Rachel McAdams.  Cady Heron may have grown up on an African savanna, but nothing prepared her for the wild and vicious ways of her strange new home: Illinois. How will this naïve newbie rise to the top of the popularity pecking order? By taking on The Plastics, a trio of lionized frenemies led by the charming but ruthless Regina George. But, when Cady devises a plan to end Regina’s reign, she learns the hard way that you can’t cross a Queen Bee without getting stung. We are so ready. "
ARTS & CULTURE,Two Millennials Recreated 'Annie Hall' With A Cast Of Senior Actors,"This summer, a cast entirely comprised of senior actors starred in an adaptation of the 1977 bittersweet romcom “Annie Hall.” “With all due respect to Woody Allen’s creative and comic writing genius,” Shula Chernick, who plays the titular Annie in the film, told HuffPost. “I think our version is much funnier.”  New York-based artists Ellie Sachs and Matt Starr conceived of the project, dreaming up the possibility of creating a movie with an elderly cast on their first date. Starr, who is 28, had already developed a ritual of reenacting classic films with his grandmother Maxine, who has Alzheimer’s. The practice began when Starr realized that, as Maxine got older, their conversations started running in circles, returning again and again to the same simple questions. “I realized we probably weren’t going to have a normal relationship anymore,” Starr confessed.  Yet when Starr and Maxine sat down together to watch “Casablanca,” she began murmuring Ingrid Bergman’s lines from the film under her breath. Starr chimed in as Humphrey Bogart and the two fell into a happy rapport. Starr relayed the experience to Sachs on their date, adding, “I’d love to do this on a larger scale.” She was just the woman to make it happen.  Sachs’ background is in theater. Having worked at prisons, community centers, settlement houses and schools around the country, she was confident they could find a venue to give their idea, of working with seniors to interpret and reenact classic films, a shot.  “We were met with a lot of resistance,” Sachs recalled. “A lot of elderly centers didn’t think their populations could handle it.” Eventually, however, they found a home for their brainchild: Lenox Hill Neighborhood House, located in Manhattan’s Upper East Side.   In March, Sachs and Starr began teaching an Interpretive Cinema class at Lenox Hill. They watched and discussed scenes from films including “Annie Hall,” “Manhattan,” “Casablanca,” “Rear Window,” and “Singin’ in the Rain.” They invited those in the class to vote on which one they’d like to appear in. The class selected “Annie Hall,” which follows the romance between Alvy Singer, an overanxious comedian, and Annie Hall, a breezy and capricious nightclub singer. The more Sachs and Starr mulled over the fragmented framework of the film, the more it seemed to mirror some of the issues their actors grappled with during the aging process. “It’s a memory movie,” Sachs explained. “It tells a story in a nonlinear fashion. It comes down to the question of: What do we remember and why do we remember it? It’s a beautiful comparison to what some of our students might be experiencing.” Many of the actors are dealing, in various ways, with the reality of their minds changing and memories fading. “What could be a more perfect film to work out these issues of memory and talk through them?” Starr said.  Then came casting, a difficult task when working with a class full of outgoing personalities eager for screen time. But the directors agreed that Harry B. Miller, an Emmy-winning set designer who already looks and dresses like Woody Allen, would play Alvy. And Chernick, a self-proclaimed “gypsy,” world traveler and Diane Keaton lookalike, was the perfect Annie.  Initially, Sachs and Starr expected the film to be executed DIY-style, filmed on iPhones with little to no budget. But after seeing the caliber of talent ― and general ebullience ― of the people involved, they decided to think bigger. They’ve now raised almost $7,000 on IndieGogo to help fund the costs of pre- and post-production, including the necessary equipment, location and transportation fees.  Filming had its challenges, but most were logistical rather than personal. “A lot of [the actors] don’t have cell phones,” Starr said. “So we have to call them at 7 in the morning or at 8 at night. Some have email, but are only checking once or twice a day. The communication was difficult.” Another hurdle was the summer heat, brutal for New Yorkers of any age. “Our first day of shooting, we had a 94-year-old in 94-degree heat,” Starr said. “I took it upon myself to have one of those water bottle fans and spray him the entire time.”  Throughout the filming process, Sachs and Starr became best friends with their lead actors. “We go on lots of double dates,” Starr joked. The experience not only strengthened the quality of their collaborative artwork, the directors believe, but illuminated a kind of intergenerational relationship that’s not often experienced.  “I’ve never had friends over 40 years old,” said Starr. “I was only aware of one type of relationship, the one I have with my grandparents.” “You might have one or two older people in your life but you don’t frequently have older people that are friends,” Sachs added. “Because of that, we don’t have access to what it means to be old. Instead we have these pervasive ideas about what it means to be old.” Meeting Miller and Chernick made Sachs and Starr cast their preconceived notions about life post-retirement aside. “Our actors are a lot more active than most of our friends,” Starr said, noting that Miller tap dances, swims and takes Zumba classes regularly.  “I’ve totally decontextualized what it means to age in my head,” Sachs said. “I think it doesn’t have to be such a scary thing. Life can be full of art and love and sex. The people in our class were all dating or had romantic relationships. Just because they’re a certain age, why does that matter? They’re people.” Check out the “My Annie Hall” project on IndieGogo. "
ARTS & CULTURE,Pulitzer-Prize-Winning Poet John Ashbery Dead At 90,"Pulitzer Prize-winning American poet John Ashbery, who published more than 20 books of poetry and was known for the complexity of his style, died Sunday at age 90, U.S. media reports said. Ashbery died at his home in Hudson, New York, the New York Times and ABC News reported, citing his husband David Kermani. The cause of death was not disclosed. Ashbery, who was first associated with the New York school of poetry in the 1950s and 1960s, won the Pulitzer Prize for “Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror” in 1976. The collection won the National Book Award and the National Book Circle Critics Award the same year. Ashbery was deeply influenced by abstract expressionist art and early in his career was an art critic. He tried to capture the experience of disorder in his poems, with experience slipping away from the process of understanding. “I would like to please the reader, and I think that surprise has to be an element of this, and that may necessitate a certain amount of teasing,” he said in a 1983 Paris Review interview. Ashbery was born in Rochester, New York, the son of a biology teacher and a farmer, and wrote his first poem at 8. He graduated from Harvard University and went to France as a Fulbright Scholar in the 1950s. He was awarded the National Humanities Medal in 2011 by President Barack Obama, who praised him for profoundly influencing generations of writers."
ARTS & CULTURE,Miranda July's New Art Project Is An Interfaith Charity Store,"“I’ve been working on a secret art project for more than a year now,” Miranda July posted on Instagram Thursday morning. The writer, filmmaker and conceptual artist then announced the surprise venture: a pop-up, interfaith charity shop housed within Selfridges, London’s largest luxury department store. The American July was inspired by the U.K.’s plentiful charity shops, or secondhand stores comprised of donated goods whose proceeds benefit certain causes. “Every faith, every disability, every cause has a charity shop and that just doesn’t exist anywhere else in the world,” July told The Guardian. “There’s something that feels very hopeful about them.” Yet, instead of selecting one religious charity for the shop to assist, July chose four. She worked with the Norwood Jewish Charity Shop, the London Buddhist Centre Charity Shop, the Spitalfields Crypt Trust Charity Shop (which assists people who are homeless, impoverished and struggling with addiction) as well as the Islamic Relief Charity Shop to create what is billed as the U.K.’s first interfaith charity store. July was particularly intrigued by the idea of benefiting an Islamic Relief organization. Although she began formulating the idea for the shop before Donald Trump announced his executive order banning people from certain Muslim-majority nations from entering her native United States, July was conscious of Islamophobia in American society. She speculated that an Islamic Relief charity store could not even exist in the U.S. because “it would just be seen as too scary.” Employees from the four charity organizations will staff July’s pop-up, splitting the proceeds evenly. Each group will also donate 2.5 percent of their share to another charity of their choosing.  July and her team have been collecting secondhand goods to sell over the course of the past year, storing clothing, shoes and tchotchkes in a warehouse while setting up the store. Most items are priced affordably ― below £20 ($26) ― a stark contrast to the pricey merchandise at Selfridges, where price tags feature one or two additional zeros. The juxtaposition of thrift and luxury appealed to July, who often tweaks everyday exercises to make room for intimacy and contemplation. “What’s nice is that it is inherently participatory,” she told The Guardian. “You apply your taste, you choose things, sometimes you take off all your clothes and put on strangers’ clothes in this case, and there’s a transaction when you buy something. So that’s seductive, because it means all different kinds of people feel comfortable.” July’s shop, commissioned by Artangel, is open until Oct. 22 and located at the Selfridges on 400 Oxford Street in London."
ARTS & CULTURE,This Is How Museums In And Around Houston Prepared For Tropical Storm Harvey,"Over the past five days, Tropical Storm Harvey, the worst storm to hit the Houston, Texas, region in 50 years, has devastated the country’s fourth-largest city.  Along with being home to one of the most diverse populations in America, Houston and its surrounding areas also house a stunning accumulation of modern, contemporary and community-based art. How did museums throughout Houston and its surrounding area prepare for the Category 4 hurricane and the catastrophic flooding in its wake? And how are they dealing with, or preparing to deal with, its effects? HuffPost reached out to a variety of art institutions in the area, who graciously took the time to describe how they readied themselves for Harvey and what they plan to do after the storm subsides.  “We have a wonderful crew who prepared the museum and continued to monitor it during the storm,” Christina Brungardt, the deputy director of the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston, wrote to HuffPost in an email. “The building was braced for flooding with water barriers and sandbags. In addition, our registrar’s team de-installed our downstairs exhibition and moved it to the upstairs space.”  As of Wednesday, Brungardt reported that the museum does not appear to have experienced any flooding, though a crew is currently investigating the potential for any structural damage. The museum has experienced damage as a result of natural disaster in the past; a 1976 storm left nine feet of flooding in the museum’s lower level.  “Community support was immediate, as was the NEA emergency fund grant,” Brungardt said. “A fund drive for flood relief was held in 1977 to assist with damages and to upgrade our facilities for flood control, including adding a concrete water barrier at the top of one of our loading ramps and gas powered pumps to pull the water out.” In 2001, Tropical Storm Allison similarly left three feet of water in the museum’s lower level. The facility was able to recover thanks to community support and emergency grants. In the storm’s aftermath, the museum invested in movable water barriers for targeted flood control. The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston underwent a similar protocol for storm protection. “Our hurricane-preparedness team implemented all of our storm-planning measures to secure the buildings,” Mary Haus, the head of marketing and communications at the museum said.  “These are protocols we have long had in place, including sandbags, stationing emergency water pumps, floodgate activation for the buildings and the stationing of a 24/7 emergency team on site at the main campus to monitor everything for the duration of the storm. That team includes engineers, art handlers, IT and other staff. As part of advance planning, works of art that were in a potentially vulnerable location, such as by a window or under a skylight, were moved as needed.” To Haus’ knowledge, there has been no damage to any artworks in any of the collections as of yet. That, thankfully, includes a temporary exhibition by Swiss multimedia artist Pipilotti Rist, which viewers experience while resting on beds inside the museum space.  The Galveston Arts Center, a space for contemporary art and educational programming located on the Gulf Coast, is also safe from major damage.  “We were preparing for an opening on Saturday, Aug. 26, featuring three Houston based artists ― Bradley Kerl, Angel Oloshove and Christopher Cascio,” Reese Darby, who does marketing for the center, wrote to HuffPost. “The decision had been made on Wednesday, Aug. 23, to start packing the art and moving it into storage upstairs. “The building was originally a bank built in 1886, and we still retain three bank vaults which we use for storage. Items from ArtWorks, the museum store, were also stored in the vaults for safekeeping.”  At 131 years old, the GAC building has braced for floods in the past, including the 1900 Galveston hurricane, the deadliest natural disaster in U.S. history. And 2008′s Hurricane Ike, which brought around 13 feet of rain to the surrounding streets, left the GAC’s bottom floor ― and the Helen Altman exhibition displayed in it ― completely ruined. Subsequently, the space was renovated to better handle situations like Harvey.  “Bryan Garcia, our head of operations, and our current Board President Doug McClean also have systems in place to board up the windows and building, and secure and package exhibiting artworks, in case a hurricane touches down on the Island,” Darby said. “We are a small staff of five, plus our Board President, who are all dedicated to the the security, safety and future of our organization.” As of Monday, Darby was happy to report the space was “high and dry.” In emails to HuffPost, representatives from Project Row Houses, the Rothko Chapel and The Menil Collection all reported no damage resulting from the flood.  “Since Friday, the Menil has maintained an around-the-clock security and maintenance presence at the museum making regular checks on our basements in the main building and Menil Drawing Institute construction site, and on the skylights in the main building and at the Cy Twombly Gallery,” Tommy Napier, assistant director of communications at the Menil, explained.  “Periodic checks are being made at our other buildings, which include the Dan Flavin Installation at Richmond Hall and the Byzantine Fresco Chapel. We have done preventative sandbagging at buildings that require it. At this time, and thankfully, our buildings have not been impacted by the storm. Our director, conservation and registration departments, which include art handling services, are receiving regular updates about building status.” The Menil is currently celebrating its 30th anniversary with the exhibition “Thirty Works for Thirty Years,” featuring a selection of standout works culled from the approximately 10,000 works in the permanent collection.  For the most part, museums throughout Houston were lucky enough to withstand major harm as a result of the storm. However, in a Facebook message, Luis Purón, the executive director of the Rockport Center for the Arts, located near Corpus Christi, shared it had suffered severe damage.  “From images I have been provided and third party accounts, it appears the building has sustained serious external damage,” Purón wrote. “One image demonstrates that the front porch is completely gone and a roof structure in the front of the building is exposed and thus compromised. It is entirely possible that additional damage to the roof exists, yet only an onsite inspection will reveal that. We are working on obtaining that information.” The Rockport Center for the Arts is currently exhibiting an array of miniature paintings, drawings and found art assemblages by artist Tim Olson. The Center also offers art classes for children and families and hosts a variety of culturally-minded events throughout the year.  “The building is still standing as it has since 1983 a few feet from Aransas Bay,” Purón continued. “It remains unclear if all the sculptures in the Sculpture Garden collection survived the 130 miles-per-hour winds of Harvey’s category 4 direct impact to Rockport. We won’t know about internal damage until we are able to re-enter and inspect the building. The timeline for that is uncertain.” Representatives for the Rockport Center have yet to respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. The arts institutions in contact with HuffPost all emphasized the supreme safety of their staff and community during this harrowing natural disaster. Many also expressed their hope that, after the flooding lets up, the museums and art centers can provide spaces for reflection, comfort and healing following the trauma of the storm.  As Alison Pruitt, director of operations at the Rothko Chapel, said, “The Chapel will reopen its doors as soon as it is safe for our staff and visitors, so that those in need of solace can gather and come together during the road to recovery ahead.” See how you can help the victims of Hurricane Harvey here. "
ARTS & CULTURE,'Alt-Right' Children's Book Shelved For Blatantly Copying Pepe The Frog,"Writing children’s books with hateful, xenophobic messages may not be against the law, but copyright infringement is. Matt Furie, the artist behind the viral amphibian Pepe the Frog, brought copyright infringement charges against a former Texas assistant principal whose self-published picture book revolved around a racist frog named Pepe. As reported by Motherboard’s Matthew Gault, The Adventures of Pepe and Pede author Eric Hauser admitted to copying Furie’s image, and the lawsuit was settled in a few days. All sales of the book will come to a close and the entirety of its profits will go toward a Muslim civil rights advocacy organization.  For those familiar with Pepe the Frog, the resemblance between Pepe and Pepe is, well, nearly exact. Comic artist Furie created the original Pepe ― a mellow bro of a frog ― in 2005, as part of the zine “Boy’s Club.” The character consisted of a pizza-loving slacker who spent his days smoking weed, farting and roasting his fellow 20-something roommates.  Three years after the small zine was released, an image of Pepe went viral on the online message board 4chan. Before long, permutations of Pepe began popping up on Reddit, Instagram and other corners of the internet, having fully ascended to meme status. There was Angry Pepe, Feels Bad Man Pepe, Nu Pepe and Poo Poo Pee Pee, some of which were enjoyed by famed internet users like Katy Perry and Nicki Minaj.  Pepe’s story took a turn in 2015, however, when white supremacists hijacked the image, which they adapted to resemble figures like Adolf Hitler and Donald Trump. Events came to a head when the Anti-Defamation League declared Pepe a hate symbol in 2016. It was a strange internet journey that led Furie to declare the frog officially dead earlier this year in hopes of moving on from the well-meaning frog that accidentally yet inextricably became associated with racism, xenophobia and hate.  And dead Pepe remained dead, at least until Hauser’s children’s book emerged on the scene. “Pepe the Frog and his best friend Centipede unite as one to restore law and order, and bring freedom back to Wishington Farm!” the book’s tagline reads. Along with Pepe’s associations with the so-called “alt-right,” Trump supporters often refer to themselves as centipedes on the Reddit thread /r/TheDonald.  The book follows Pepe and Pede as they take down a bearded alligator called Alkah, whose name clearly resembles Allah. The frog and bug, by throwing buds from the honesty tree, defeat Alkah and his mud-covered minions, quite literally draining the swamp. “With law and order now restored, this land was great again,” it ends. And everyone lives not-so-politically-correctly ever after? After the book caused controversy in Hauser’s hometown of Dallas, he was removed from his post as middle school assistant principal and reassigned to another position in the district. Hauser resigned as a result. “The book was worse than I thought,” Chad Withers, a teacher in Hauser’s district, told Motherboard. “The story itself is despicable, racist, and xenophobic. I was disgusted by it. I’ve never seen anything before that was so obviously targeted propaganda to children.” Hauser himself, however, maintained the book did not promote the “alt-right,” nor themes of bigotry and hate. Rather he told the Dallas Observer Pepe and Pede was meant to “break down the barriers of political correctness and embrace truth.” Ukrainian freelance artist Nina Khalova was hired to illustrate the book. As Gault uncovered, Hauser specifically requested that Khalova create the alligator’s minions based off cartoons of women in burqas. Because she lived in the Ukraine, Khalova was unaware of the dark political implications of the project. At the end of the day, Hauser’s fatal mistake was asking Khalova to create the character of Pepe by directly copying an image of Pepe the frog. “I want the frog to look very similar to this frog,” Hauser directed, attaching a picture of Furie’s Pepe.  This made intellectual property lawyers Louis Tompros and Don Steinberg’s job pretty simple. Hauser admitted to copying Furie’s work nearly immediately and sales of the book were brought to a halt. The $1,521.54 profit earned so far was redirected to benefit the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR). “It’s important for everyone to stand up against hate, whenever and wherever they can,” Tompros, who took on the case pro bono, told HuffPost. “Matt Furie was willing to do that by fighting back against the alt-right’s efforts to claim Pepe as a symbol of hate. We knew that we had the ability as intellectual property lawyers to help in that fight, so we did.” Pepe and Pede was slated to be published in hardcover this November by Post Hill Press, the independent publisher, distributed by Simon & Schuster, behind gems like Go the F**K to Jail: An Adult Coloring Book of the Clinton Scandals.  For Tompros, the Pepe case offered a rare opportunity to make the world a little less hateful. “Lawyers in areas like immigration and constitutional law get to use their day job skills to make the world a better place all the time,” he said. “It’s considerably less common for intellectual property law to be the right tool in the fight for social justice. But when it was, we wanted to make sure we were there to do our part.” It seems The Adventures of Pepe and Pede have officially come to an end. We hope Matt Furie’s chill, stoner frog will finally get some well-deserved rest and, you know, not be appropriated by bigoted middle school assistant principals into xenophobic propaganda again anytime soon.  CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article stated that Post Hill Press is an imprint of Simon & Schuster. In fact it is an the independent publisher distributed by Simon & Schuster. This article also stated Hauser was fired as a result of his book; rather, he was reassigned to another position, then resigned. "
ARTS & CULTURE,The Married Couple Behind Summer's Darkest And Weirdest Comedy,"Janicza Bravo’s film “Lemon” begins with a black woman’s face on a television screen. “They come in the night, always at night. You don’t hear them coming,” the woman says. “They took my family. They burned my village. They didn’t take me. I don’t know why.”  The camera then pans slowly through a Los Angeles apartment and lands upon a sleeping man named Isaac, played by Brett Gelman, whose crotch is soaked with urine. He wakes up, rubs the pee-stained spot with his hands and sniffs them before jumping up from the couch and frantically attempting to remove his pants without waking his girlfriend. This introduction aptly summarizes who Isaac is. He’s lame, pathetic, grotesque; a failure by most standards. And yet, as a white guy, he’s removed from any real possibility of danger or harm. The worst fate that could befall him is the banal shame of wetting himself.  “There is this genre of white guy comedy where a 30-something guy is floundering,” Bravo told HuffPost. “But he has a solid group of friends, a really strong family, a romantic partner who supports him, and things generally just work out for him in the end.” Bravo’s film explores what happens when things don’t magically come together for the protagonist, and what being stuck in a plateau of white male mediocrity looks like. Isaac’s stagnant, cinematic journey takes place over a brief period of time throughout which not much changes. He teaches a drama class, his girlfriend dumps him, he attends Passover dinner with his family and goes on a few dates with a stylist he meets on a set. Isaac starts the film narcissistic, unstable, violent and uncomfortable. He ends up, more or less, the same.  The film is a dark ― very dark ― comedy, full of anxiety and dread. “It’s about facing the dark aspects of who you are,” Gelman said. He and Bravo, who are married, wrote the script together over the past six years. Gelman is white and Jewish; Bravo, who is black, was born in the U.S. and grew up in Panama. They met on the set of a commercial ― Bravo was a stylist, Gelman an actor ― an encounter they reenact, to a degree, in the film.  Despite the one parallel, however, Bravo identifies more with Isaac than with Cleo (Nia Long), the black stylist he meets and eventually dates. “When we were writing the piece we were working through our own big fears,” Bravo said. “One was that we’d wake up 10 years from now and not have a sense of how we got there. Our life would be in a plateau.” Gelman added: “We hope that in facing the pain we will exorcize those feelings.” “Lemon” is theatrical, absurd and surreal. As Bravo, who has a background in theater, put it, “It does not exist on the plane that we’re existing on.” Aesthetically, it has a 1970s vibe, emphatic choreography and a strange sense that the whole film, like Isaac’s pajamas, have been stained with urine. It rings “indie” ― a genre that, for the most part, has been resoundingly white.  Bravo uses Isaac to explore issues of race and gender from the vantage point of a white man. She regards whiteness as a race with biases, stereotypes and habits ― not just a neutral palette. “If Isaac were a person of color, he would be destroyed,” Gelman said. “He would not be able to exist on that plateau of mediocrity. He’s the darkness America was founded upon.” And yet Bravo and Gelman approach Isaac without judgement. His weaknesses, after all, are projections of their own, whether real or imagined. “Hopefully the film makes people feel less alone in their own flaws,” Gelman said. “Our hope is that people laugh at the dread that you might be this person. As Joan Rivers said: ‘Laugh at the dragon.’” Isaac has quite a few dragons. At the beginning of the film, Isaac is with his partner Ramona, played by Judy Greer, who is blind. She seems disinterested in Isaac from the beginning and eventually decides to end their relationship of ten years.  “I could hit you,” he says, after she says she wants out. “I could suffocate you. I could strangle you. I could cut you up and bag you up and throw you away in the woods in a hole where no one could find you. Do you know how many men have killed their girlfriends and wives? Millions.” Seconds later he breaks down and begs her to stay, and the breakup talk continues.  “There’s a permission for men to behave and go as they please and the women kind of accept it,” Bravo explained. “We’ve created this environment where men can do whatever then ask for an apology and have an out. A swimmer rapes a woman and sort of apologizes for it and it’s like, he has so much promise and should be let off. Isaac is not socialized; he’s like a kid. He hasn’t been told he isn’t allowed to behave that way.” Isaac’s misogyny also manifests in the acting class he teaches, where he criticizes a student named Tracy (Gillian Jacobs) in a wildly creative and abusive manner, and in the same breath treats his prized student, Alex (Michael Cera), like a god on earth. There’s a running bit where, after class, Jacobs’ character asks Isaac and Alex for help dealing with various car troubles. They never respond, and at one point, the scene cuts Jacobs off mid-sentence. “In a lot of comedies women play this accessory role,” Bravo explained. “They might as well be called girl, wife, pussy. If a movie does have women talk it’s billed as being ’by girls, for girls!′ and it’s a whole thing. We were also commenting on that.” After Isaac’s breakup with Ramona, he begins dating stylist Cleo. During their first conversation, upon learning she has a son, Isaac says, “My sister has a black son.” Cleo’s taken aback but not quite appalled. On their third date, she begrudgingly agrees to bring Isaac to a barbecue with her Caribbean family. While smoking a joint with a group of Cleo’s cousins, Isaac says, apropos of nothing, “More welfare are on white people than black people. They make you think it’s the opposite. This is where the resentment in the white community comes from.” Isaac’s awkwardness is often taken to surreal heights in the film. But his strained interactions with people of color, Bravo said, are all based in reality. “People have said those things to me many times,” she said. “They’ve made weird comments about black women’s hair, about welfare, government and poverty. They’re not exaggerations, because I have lived them.” “They pour out of him because he’s aware that he’s not in the majority,” she continued. “He’s aware that he is not black in a space that is all black. When that’s happened to me, white people say ‘I have read Coates’ and ‘I have read James Baldwin.’ I’m like, I don’t need that, I’m actually really uncomfortable now. There is a great discomfort about race; people are trying to relate and sometimes they don’t have the tools to.”  “He doesn’t have the tools because he never had to,” Gelman adds. “You don’t need to think of the other in order to thrive in the world, in our country. White is top because white is invisible.” Bravo finished his thought: “White people think: ‘I am the norm, the other is the strange thing.’ We don’t talk about white culture. Isaac grew up in a world where he hasn’t had to think about who people of color are, what their feelings are. He’s nervous, it feels foreign to him.” The majority of films ― especially indie comedies ― operate from this perspective, where whiteness is the default and therefore remains unexamined, taken for granted. With “Lemon,” Bravo and Gelman deconstruct whiteness and masculinity without leniency, but still, without judgment.  It’s a similar tactic Bravo takes to calling out Gelman’s occasional missteps in real life ― though his are worlds away from Isaac’s. At a point in our conversation, when discussing discrimination women face in America, Bravo reminded him that 53 percent of white women voted for Trump. Gelman changed his wording and thanked her. “Here you go, white guy,” Bravo joked, “you have to admit when you’re wrong and you have to apologize and learn from it.” With “Lemon,” Bravo and Gelman hope that laughter begets thinking, coping and change, even ― or perhaps especially ― when confronting subject matter that is stressful or ugly. “We are working very much from a place of our feelings,” Bravo said. “They are anxious and a little bit bleak, sort of like nightmares. But we both laugh a lot. I think it’s a coping mechanism; if you’re not laughing, you’re going to start crying. If you sit with it for too long it becomes a weight on your chest that feels impossible to surmount.” And that’s how you find yourself in a plateau. “Lemon” is now in theaters, On Demand, on Amazon Video and on iTunes."
ARTS & CULTURE,A Sci-Fi Magazine Created Entirely By Writers And Editors With Disabilities Is Coming,"“I’m partially deafblind, and I’ve never seen anyone like me in fiction of any type,” writer and activist Elsa Sjunneson-Henry told HuffPost. As an editor of the upcoming magazine “Disabled People Destroy Science Fiction,” that is about to change. Historically, science fiction has been good at opening up space for creatives to imagine possible futures. By speculating about tomorrow, writers, artists and filmmakers can freely grapple with the obstacles, fears, injustices and looming questions pertinent today. However, despite displaying immense creative flexibility when visualizing future technologies, modes of transportation and alien invasion techniques, human populations in the sci-fi genre remain ― with some notable exceptions ― resoundingly cisgendered, white and able-bodied. An upcoming magazine called “Disabled People Destroy Science Fiction” hopes to “put disabled voices at the center of the narrative,” as Sjunneson-Henry put it, and make normative imagining of the future a thing of the past.  “I want to make it so that able-bodied readers can’t look away from, or explain away ableism,” she continued. “I hope that we can give authors hope, who felt their narratives weren’t welcome. I hope we can give people a glimpse into our lives. But most importantly, I hope we give our disabled community stories they’ve longed for. To me, that’s the most important piece. That we give everyone as much of an opportunity to see themselves as possible.” For the past three years, the so-called “Destroy” series has worked to diversify the sci-fi landscape by publishing anthologies highlighting voices traditionally marginalized in the genre ― thus “destroying” sci-fi’s whitewashed and patriarchal history. The first three editions of “Destroy,” published by Lightspeed Magazine, are “Women Destroy Science Fiction,” “Queers Destroy Science Fiction” and “People of Colo(u)r Destroy Science Fiction.” Each disrupts a specific vision of the future that’s decidedly outdated. Through generating new and gripping stories from unrepresented perspectives, the magazines hoped to inflect readers’ understandings of the present through vivid visions of the future.  For the fourth edition of “Destroy,” which is currently fundraising on Kickstarter, the people at Lightspeed Magazine recruited Lynne M. Thomas and Michael Damian Thomas of Uncanny Magazine ― a science fiction and fantasy mag ― to take over as editors, in part because of their familiarity with the disabled community.  “Our daughter has a rare congenital syndrome called Aicardi syndrome,” Lynne explained to HuffPost. “And Michael (who is also disabled) has been a disability advocate for 13 years, including chairing our city’s disability advisory commission.” Because of their intimate involvement with disability activism ― and their longtime devotion to science fiction ― the Lynne and Michael were in an ideal position to take over the “Destroy” legacy.  But they couldn’t do it alone. To help with “Disabled People Destroy Science Fiction,” they recruited a guest editing staff comprised entirely of people with disabilities ― living with conditions including chronic pain and spastic cerebral palsy. Instead of incorporating select, token voices from minority communities, who then operate within a structural framework that wasn’t made with them in mind, “Destroy” builds a team who can address disability issues with familiarity and nuance.  As Sjunneson-Henry explained, the editorial roster not only affects the quality of the final product, it also makes the day-to-day process of creating the publication far more comfortable and productive. “We’re collaborating on a level you don’t see very often,” she said. “I’ll speak specifically to my working relationship with Dominik [Parisien], my co-editor-in-chief who is responsible for fiction. He and I check in with each other near daily, not just because we are working together, but because some days I might be ill or need someone to carry more of the weight during the process of developing submissions guidelines, or maybe he’s having a more difficult day.” Along with the editing team, the writers contributing to the issue will also represent a wide range of individuals from across the disability spectrum. “Disabled People Destroy” features fiction, nonfiction, poetry and personal essays. Writers including Rachel Swirsky, Fran Wilde, Alice Wong, Bogi Takács and Khairani Barokka are already on board, but the magazine is still looking for submissions in all writing categories.  Sjunneson-Henry is editor of the nonfiction works. “My vision for the issue is pretty simple,” she explained. “I want to give disabled authors the ability in the nonfiction section to share truths. Whether it’s ugly truth about the way they’ve been represented in our genre, or the truth of what it’s like to be a disabled author, or how you feel about writing your disability, I’m looking for my authors to share, if not a full window into their lives, a peek through the doorway.” “Disabled People Destroy” has already surpassed its Kickstarter goal of $22,000 by almost $20,000 at the time of this article’s publication. The money raised will go toward both the “Destroy” special issue and the next edition of “Uncanny Magazine.” Even though the “Destroy” team has already surpassed their goal, sci-fi readers interested in new and different stories are still encouraged to contribute, and thus support a burgeoning publication devoted to imaginative, distinct stories that cannot be found anywhere else. Backers will receive a patch that says “Space Unicorn Ranger Corps,” so there’s also that. "
ARTS & CULTURE,This Prairie City Deserves Your Travel Dollars. Here’s Why.,"Canada, once again, does it better. Not only is our neighbor to the North able to offer free healthcare and create a tolerant atmosphere towards diversity, but it also has tricks up its sleeves when it comes to its smaller cities. I’ve had a chance to visit Winnipeg, Manitoba on a recent visit to Canada. This trip has reminded me that great discoveries and amazing experiences can be found anywhere—if only we are willing to look. “Your assumptions are your windows on the world. Scrub them off every once in a while, or the light won’t come in.” - Isaac Asimov Tucked away in the southeast corner of the vast Manitoba province, Winnipeg is an easy two and a half hour flight from Chicago. Upon landing, a laid back, traffic jam-free version of Chicago awaits. Indeed, Winnipeg has been called “Chicago of the North” during its boom of the late nineteenth—early twentieth century. People have lived here for millennia, attracted to the favorable location on the intersection of the Red and Assiniboine rivers. The battle ground for the fierce fur trading battles of the Hudson Bay Company fame, Winnipeg became Canada’s third-largest city and a major railway transportation center by the turn of the century. As railways slowly lost importance in the twentieth century, the glory of Winnipeg disappeared with them. Today, a quiet resurgence of a different kind is brewing. In the last year alone, half a dozen new breweries have opened in the city of seven hundred thousand residents. Indeed, Winnipeg is one of the latest places to undergo the craft beer revolution as its laws have turned in favor of craft producers in 2016. Now, it is entirely within reach to stop by a brewery such as Little Brown Jug while strolling through downtown Winnipeg. The open concept craft brewer welcomes customers to come in and enjoy a pint or two while observing the end-to-end beer making process. This creative upsurge is sweeping across the city. A sure win for the Winnipeg’s creative community, recently launched Design Quarter is a curated destination experience and a collective of local businesses that aims to promote authentic retail and design focused culture. Created and led by Johanna Hurme, a Finnish-born architect who now calls Winnipeg home, the Design Quarter makes it easier for visitors to find unique food, design, and shopping opportunities that are sure to inspire.  One of the spots on the Design Quarter map is Forth. A cafe, a craft cocktail bar, a rooftop music venue, and a community meeting space, Forth is a great example of what Winnipeg’s creative spirit stands for: supporting each other is at the forefront of the city’s creative community. Another spot on the Design District map that shouldn’t be missed is the Lennard Taylor Design Studio, loved locally and recognized globally for its fashion-forward, detail-oriented pieces that don’t fit a particular mold. Pop in the open concept studio at any given moment and you’re sure to see the soccer-hopeful turned fashion designer and artist himself sitting behind his sewing machine or putting finishing touches on his latest painting, always with a smile.  Fashion designers, jewelry artists, coffee roasters, painters, book purveyors, fine leather craftsmen, and more—this is Winnipeg. If a tight-knit community is one way to describe it, open concept would be another. As if borrowing from the vast swaths of prairies that surround the city, Winnipeggers exchange ideas as easily as they share food on their table, welcome people, and converge on a common goal of growing their city together.  If encountering a passionate community of creative minds isn’t compelling enough, there is an opportunity to experience Winnipeg—and with it, a glimpse of humanity—in a different way. The Canadian Museum of Human Rights is a first museum of its kind dedicated to a concept, not artifacts. Thought-provoking exhibitions about the Holocaust, the plight of the First Nations, the Ukrainian Holodomor, and more educate and invite reflection on human nature and on what it means to have a shared future. It’s a delicate balance to present such difficult topics with dignity, poignancy and compassion. The museum maintains it expertly.  The thoughtful design of the museum was conceived by Antoine Predock. The New Mexico-based architect aims to show, through structures, how human beings can interact spiritually with a building, with technology, with the natural environment and with each other. The architecture with odd angles and contradicting lines continues to stun throughout the visit and represents the idea that the path to equal human rights is not straightforward. Winnipeg may have been called Chicago of the North in the past, but today the city is coming into its own. Because of places like the unassuming Clementine Cafe (you’ll discover a whole new world by trying its yogurt panna cotta with nectarines), Winnipeg easily competes with such culinary heavyweights  as Chicago and New York, while award-winning architects, musicians, artists, and fashion designers choose to create here, with passion.  This spirit is contagious.

ARTS & CULTURE,"Instead Of Focusing On Yesterday's Monuments, Artists Are Building Tomorrow's","Thousands of white supremacists and neo-Nazis marched on the streets of Charlottesville, Virginia, last week. Their rally ― which turned deadly when a man rammed his car into a crowd of counter-protesters ― centered around a monument to Confederate General Robert E. Lee. The local city council voted to remove the statue earlier this year, but white supremacists from around the country, some armed with military-grade weapons, were seeking to defend it. Within days of the violence, politicians in Baltimore, Maryland; Jacksonville, Florida; Memphis, Tennessee and Lexington, Kentucky, began taking the necessary steps toward removing Confederate statues. Questions about monuments ― the people they serve and histories they preserve ― flooded the news and social media. Five years earlier, curators Paul Farber and Ken Lum led a course at the University of Pennsylvania called “Memory, Monuments and Urban Space.” Together, the professors and students in attendance discussed the meaning of monuments in this contemporary age. “A monument is a statement of power and presence in a city,” Farber told HuffPost over the phone. “It’s a way to make history public and enduring, reflecting not just interpretations of the past but the power dynamics of the present.” Farber’s class explored how artists and activists use monuments to challenge the status quo, especially with regards to race, gender and sexuality. Students imagined future monuments that don’t yet exist; monuments that could calcify the stories often pushed to the margins of history. They also brainstormed ways to impact and subvert existing monuments by remixing, critiquing or simply standing next to them and making their presence known. These structures, Farber expressed, are not just reminders of the past. They are unique in their ability to bring past, present and future together in a single object. “I think the monument is traditionally understood as a way to freeze time, to carry it forward,” Farber said. “But what we found, more so, is that monuments are a way to talk about how history is carried into the present.” In 2015, Farber and Lum built a temporary monument outside of Philadelphia’s City Hall and installed what they call a Learning Lab. There, they posed a single question to passersby: What is an appropriate monument for the current city of Philadelphia? “We wanted people to chew on that question,” Farber said. “What values and visions have we inherited from past monuments? What monuments would we build to reflect our values as a city ― a nourishing site for democracy?” Hundreds of people submitted proposals and those ideas became the creative data that pushed Farber and Lum to envision their project on a grander scale. They could sense that these conversations about monuments, power, authority and history were bubbling to the surface with increasing urgency.  The result of the years-long project, a public art project titled “Monument Lab,″ will take over the city of Philadelphia this fall. Twenty artists of various ages, races, gender identities and artistic backgrounds will erect monuments in 10 public spaces spread throughout the city. Farber is interested in conventionally weighty statues, sure, but also in monuments made of light and video and sound, through activations and occupations of space. Artist Marisa Williamson, for example, plans to orchestrate an interactive scavenger hunt app meant to uncover overlooked sites of African American history in the Washington Square area. Video and sound performances will lead participants to new locations which will tell hushed American stories.  In Rittenhouse Square, artist Sharon Hayes will mount a temporary monument “to the absence of monuments to women in Philadelphia.” Titled “If They Should Ask,” the sculptures will resemble the bases of the statues currently honoring men and their accomplishments, inscribed with the names of civically-engaged women throughout Philadelphia’s history.  Other contemporary monuments will take shape as musical performances, neon installations, epic poems and augmented reality works, in forms equally as diverse as the women and men responsible for them. They will honor not just white, male politicians and military heroes but students, immigrant families, Native Americans and public space itself. This is largely what differentiates the monuments of tomorrow from those of yesterday, Farber said.  For centuries, power in this country was possessed only by a select few. “Since antiquity, monuments have been expressions of power,” Farber explained. “It’s important to note our monuments we’ve inherited from the past do not tell our full histories.”  Through Monument Lab, Farber hopes to consider the countless marginalized artists and activists who have fought “not only for equal representation but any representation at all.” Today, public art offers the opportunity to remediate the injustices of the past and collaborate on visions for the future.  On Tuesday, President Donald Trump tweeted, “Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments.” The remarks underscore a widespread opinion amongst some Americans who believe that historic statues possess an inherent value, simply because they are monuments. “By virtue of their materials, height and size, a certain gravitas is given to them,” Farber explained. “There is a value system that is bestowed to monuments, but, of course, the story is often more complicated.” “Often the monuments built to tell stories of the past are actually reflections of their present moment,” he continued. “The debates around current monuments that are tied to legacies of racial injustice, these are not merely indexing a past of repression. They very much are connected to the ways issues of racial justice carry into our current moment. Monuments are symbols, they are icons, they reflect power as it’s perpetuated in society. That is why artists and students and activists turn to monuments as platforms to make their voices heard.” Personally, Farber firmly believes that Confederate monuments should be removed in order to honor commitments to social justice, but Monument Lab itself is focused more on the future than the past. “We want to emphasize all the histories that aren’t solidified in marble and bronze,” he said. “Our project is designed to unearth all the monuments that could be.” Monument Lab, co-produced by Mural Arts Philadelphia and curators Paul Farber and Ken Lum, will run from Sept. 16 until Nov. 19 at various sites throughout Philadelphia. "
ARTS & CULTURE,Reclaiming Presidential Moral Leadership,"In a previous blog we spoke about the indebtedness we had as a nation to what I called our children of August. This was shorthand symbolism for the lives of some of Our Children murdered in August 1964 in Philadelphia, Mississippi, and the recent murder of Heather Heyer in Charlottesville, Virginia We spoke hopefully about the possibility that events in Charlottesville August 2017 might provide a bridge for our nation to finally “crossover” from the shame of our legacy of slavery to 21st century commitment to the principles and precepts enshrined in our Declaration of Independence. We acknowledged the pain and deep-seated antagonism that persist among the descendants of slaves and former slaveholders currently exemplified over the retention or removal of monuments and statutes commemorating leaders of the slave owning states of the Confederacy defeated in our earlier Civil War. Presumably, those persons most passionate and active in their opposition to removal of monuments honoring the leaders of the Confederacy forgot or did not know the poignant powerful words of President Lincoln spoken November 19th, 1963, at a blood-soaked battlefield in Gettysburg, PA. Lincoln sought to reset the moral compass of the nation following our Civil War: “Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.  Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.  But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate ― we can not consecrate ― we can not hallow ― this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us ― that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion ― that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain ― that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom ― and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.” Had any of those persons in Charlottesville, Virginia, demonstrating to prevent removal the statue of Robert Lee ever read or heard about Lincoln’s Gettysburg address? Did president Trump reflect on this before his ’moral equivalency” remarks in the lobby of Trump Tower Tuesday in New York? When we say “moral equivalency” we suggest that when President Trump equated the protests of those who support the retention of Confederate monuments as being as “morally right,” he abdicated and besmirched his moral leadership as president of these United States of America. Are persons who supported the institution of slavery “morally equivalent” to those who opposed it? Is the institution of slavery simply a matter of opinion? Some people can agree with it, other people can disagree, but both opinions must be respected?  Are the opinions and views of those who believed it was okay for slave traders to transport millions of the ancestors of the current generation of African-Americans in slave ships to be slaves in our country to be given the same respect and veneration as the opinions of those whose ancestors who were slaves? Are the views of those persons in Charlottesville who are not offended that 6 million Jews were killed during the Holocaust under Adolf Hitler morally equivalent to the opinions of those whose grandparents were murdered under the Nazi’s regime? The reason a compass has been historically used by Mariners is that it gave them a sense of “true North” on the sea. It enabled persons to chart their direction from some commonly agreed terrestrial point. The compass has a universally accepted direction of North in contrast to South, East or West. There is no “equivalency”. Legend has it that some of our past great leaders in Congress would often carry with them a pocket-size version of our U.S. Constitution. We recommend that President Trump keep with him at all times the text of the speech that Rabbi Joachim Prinz, President of the American Jewish Congress, delivered August 28th, 1963, at the March On Washington For Jobs and Freedom. Speaking before an estimated crowd in excess of 250,000, 25 percent of whom were white, gathered at the foot of the Lincoln Memorial, he said: “When I was the rabbi of the Jewish community in Berlin under the Hitler regime, I learned many things. The most important thing that I learned under those tragic circumstances was that bigotry and hatred are not ’.the most urgent problem. The most urgent, the most disgraceful, the most shameful and the most tragic problem is silence.”  “A great people which had created a great civilization had become a nation of silent onlookers. They remained silent in the face of hate, in the face of brutality and in the face of mass murder.”  “America must not become a nation of onlookers. America must not remain silent. Not merely black America , but all of America . It must speak up and act,. from the President, down to the humblest of us, and not for the sake of the Negro, not for the sake of the black community but for the sake of the image, the idea and the aspiration of America itself”."
ARTS & CULTURE,Godwin's Law Creator Supports Calling Racist Demonstrators 'Nazis',"Following a tragic weekend of political violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, that left three dead, you may be tempted to say the white supremacist demonstrators who fomented the violence are Nazis.  Go ahead: Godwin himself wouldn’t stop you. Mike Godwin, an attorney and author, coined something called Godwin’s law in 1990, when internet discussion boards were first proliferating. Godwin’s law famously posits, “As an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Hitler approaches 1.” (In other words, if an online discussion persists long enough, someone will eventually compare a person or thing to Hitler or his ideology.) In the years since he introduced the law, it has become a mainstay of internet discussion boards. And as it has proliferated, the general understanding of the law has grown less precise; though Godwin’s law is not intended to be used to penalize people for invoking Hitler, it’s often invoked now to claim that debaters who compare each other to Hitler have “violated” Godwin’s law. The penalty: The person who referenced Hitler or Nazis automatically loses the argument. A gentler version holds that once Hitler comes up in a debate, the conversation has outlived its usefulness. Godwin sees his law a bit differently, however. On Sunday, he tweeted about the events in Charlottesville, and he didn’t mince words:  By all means, compare these shitheads to Nazis. Again and again. I'm with you. This isn’t the first time he’s encouraged people to use the Hitler comparison, provided that they’re deploying it thoughtfully and with an understanding of the historical context. In June, Godwin assured a journalist who had insinuated that prominent white nationalist Richard Spencer was a Nazi that his law did not preclude the comparison. Time magazine interviewed him following the exchange, and he suggested, “If you think the comparison is valid, and you’ve given it some thought, do it ... We have to keep the magnitude of those events in mind, and not be glib.” Godwin has always maintained that his famous law was intended not to invalidate any comparison to Hitler. In fact, it wasn’t really a “law” that could be “violated” at all. Rather, he has argued, it was crafted as a counter-meme, a viral idea that would push back on the still-more viral idea of Nazism as the ultimate weapon in an online argument. It was meant to describe, in a pseudoscientific form, the lazy and predictable internet habit of invoking Hitler. By putting a name to this kneejerk habit, Godwin hoped to encourage us all to think twice before cavalierly calling our opponent a Nazi, and to give us an opportunity to choose a more apt and effective tactic. “The best way to prevent future holocausts, I believe, is not to forbear from Holocaust comparisons,” he wrote in The Washington Post in 2015, amid the rise of Trump. “[I]nstead, it’s to make sure that those comparisons are meaningful and substantive.” Though some have used Godwin’s law to push back on comparisons between white nationalists and Nazis, the law was originally intended to preserve the strength of those Nazi comparisons for times when they are genuinely merited ― for example, when an “alt-right” gathering openly associates itself with Nazi ideology and insignia.  Godwin’s denunciation of the Charlottesville demonstrators as “Nazis” stands in sharp contradistinction to President Donald Trump’s milquetoast reaction. In his initial response to the unrest, President Trump earned lacerating criticism from mainstream onlookers, and plaudits from white nationalists and neo-Nazis, by failing to explicitly denounce the rightwing extremist groups behind the violence. “Racism is evil,” Trump eventually said in a statement on Monday, “and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, Neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to what we hold dear as Americans.” Administration officials defended Trump’s earlier comments, which condemned “hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides.” Tom Bossert, Trump’s homeland security adviser, explained that the president had refused to “dignify” these movements by naming them.  If Godwin’s law proves anything, however, it’s that accurately naming what we’re up against holds tremendous power."
ARTS & CULTURE,J.K Rowling Burns Trump And Fox With The Power Of Her Tweets (Again),"J.K. Rowling will let nothing deter her from delivering some brutal honesty. The “Harry Potter” author delivered two harsh blows to Fox News and President Donald Trump on Tuesday night after the president made an anxiety-inducing comment about North Korea. “North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States. They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen,” Trump said earlier on Tuesday. Rowling’s first blow was sent straight to Fox News and White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller after the network tweeted a clip showing Miller calling Trump “the most gifted politician of our time.” “On the eve of war, tributes are paid to the Dear Leader’s silver tongue and godlike wisdom,” Rowling responded. “Wonder what’s happening in North Korea.” On the eve of war, tributes are paid to the Dear Leader's silver tongue and godlike wisdom.Wonder what's happening in North Korea. https://t.co/5qrFXr3qL1 Harsh.  The next tweet came a few hours later, highlighting an old tweet of Trump’s, from 2012. In his post, Trump quotes Ralph Waldo Emerson: “What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us.”  Whether those words came from Emerson or former Supreme Court justice Oliver Wendell Holmes is debated, but that question is irrelevant to the burn Rowling delivered: “And here you are, lying right in front of us.” And here you are, lying right in front of us. https://t.co/mOVomAfPpP Rowling has demonstrated little patience for anyone who uses their platform to spread lies, hate or violence. She’s consistently used her tweets to take down not only Trump, but also public figures such as Tomi Lahren and Piers Morgan. She even rivals Chrissy Teigen in her ability to disarm internet trolls. Remember, words are powerful weapons."
ARTS & CULTURE,Activist Artist Lights Up Trump Hotel With 'Message' From Putin,"On Monday night, the Trump Soho Hotel in New York City was illuminated with a message attributed to Vladimir Putin.  In reality, the message was from Robin Bell, a Washington, D.C.-based artist and activist who has repeatedly projected graphics condemning the Trump administration onto high-profile buildings associated with the president.  The most recent graphic intervention read “Happy to help, bro.” The phrase, featured alongside a black-and-white image of Putin set against a Russian flag, is likely a nod to the ongoing probe into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia during the 2016 presidential election. A second projection, also written across a Russian flag, read “Follow the money,” alluding to the U.S. special counsel’s current investigation into money laundering that may have occurred during the Trump Hotel’s development. Both messages flashed in both English and Russian, and, as Bell explained on Twitter, came just in time for #nationaldollarday.  Protestors dressed in Russian military uniforms also participated in the art happening by standing in front of the hotel and waving Russian flags. The intervention went on for around 15 minutes, but thanks to iPhone cameras and a little thing called Twitter, the piece lives on online. Earlier this year, Bell, known for using art to call out what he sees as the White House’s corrupt and unjust practices, projected an image of Jeff Sessions dressed as a Klansman outside the Department of Justice. He also projected the phrases “Pay Trump bribes here” and “Emoluments welcome” onto the exterior of Trump International Hotel. Another piece read, quite simply: “Experts agree: Trump is a pig.” “We really want the focus to be on the Trump administration and the people around him who are breaking the law,” Bell explained to artnet News. “Last night was a very sight specific projection on the Trump Soho because this is where we believe that some of the money that was laundered via the Russian government [was invested] and where some of the investors of that hotel came from.” Hi @realDonaldTrump, I'm projecting #followthemoney on the SoHo Trump hotel. On  #nationaldollarday of all days. https://t.co/5neeXq57kx Welcome to Battleground, where art and activism meet."
ARTS & CULTURE,10-Year-Old Kindly Alerts Museum To Mislabeled Dinosaur Exhibit,"Turns out the Museum of Natural History could learn a thing or two from one very precocious 10-year-old dinosaur lover. Charlie Edwards was visiting the London museum for an overnight sleepover with his family when he noticed something peculiar ― a sign picturing the silhouette of a Protoceratops was mislabelled as an Oviraptor. (While Protoceratops were four-legged creatures, Oviraptors were bipedal and walked on their hind legs ― obviously.) Charlie told his mom he suspected the exhibit was incorrect and she was understandably dubious. As she told The Telegraph, “I said to him ’this is the Natural History Museum ― I know you’re really good with your dinosaur information but I’m not sure if you’re right.’” Yet Charlie ― who’s wanted to be a paleontologist since he was 3 ― was adamant, assuring his mother, “I’m telling you, I’m right.” He insisted on alerting a member of the museum staff, and it’s a good thing he did.   A few weeks after his visit, Charlie received a letter from the museum telling him that he was absolutely correct; the Oviraptor label was wrongly classified after all. The institution pledged to amend the description and commended Charlie for his remarkable paleontological chops.  “The Museum was recently made aware of a mistake in one of our dinosaur galleries,” the Museum explained in a statement. “This has now been raised with our exhibitions team, and we will change this as soon as possible.” “Scientific research and our understanding of the natural world are constantly changing and the Dinosaurs gallery has been refurbished several times to reflect this,” the institution continued. “Unfortunately, in the process an error has been made. We are very impressed with Charlie’s knowledge and hope his passion for paleontology continues.” We, too, are supremely impressed, but probably not quite as floored as Charlie’s mother.  “I am really really proud of him,” his mother told The Telegraph. “Charlie has Aspergers [sic] syndrome and tends to find a subject he loves and tries to learn so much about it, so it’s really nice that he’s been able to show what he’s learnt and that knowledge base.”"
ARTS & CULTURE,"Alan Peckolick, Revolutionary Typographer, Dead At 76","Alan Peckolick, the revolutionary typographer and “graphic expressionist” painter who developed typefaces for brands like New York University and Revlon, died on Friday after suffering a severe fall in his Connecticut home. He was 76 years old.  Although he was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease 15 years ago, Peckolick was able to do the things that brought him joy ― namely, traveling, designing and painting ― through the final days of his life. “Our mantra was ‘life is not a dress rehearsal,’” his wife Jessica Weber told HuffPost on Monday. “We really packed in and were blessed with a rich, full life. His disease never got so bad that he wasn’t able to do what he loved.” Peckolick was born in 1940 in the Bronx to what he described as a “blue-collar family.” His father was a letter carrier, his mother a housekeeper. As a kid, he wasn’t exposed to many cultural institutions, but he did love to draw. In an earlier interview with HuffPost, he recalled doodling on the bags of groceries he’d pick up at his mother’s request.  “He was the most originally creative person I ever met,” Weber said. “He was a kid from the Bronx. No one could have predicted he had this enormous talent within him.” Peckolick’s mother eventually realized her son’s knack for drawing and suggested he apply to art school. After submitting a portfolio scribbled on various scraps and surfaces, he was accepted to Pratt Institute on a trial basis. However, three months into his tryout with the illustration department, Peckolick was asked to leave the program when he fell behind.  The departure led Peckolick to discover graphic design, a field that interested him in part because drawing skills weren’t a necessity. So, still at Pratt, he switched his area of study and immersed himself in the language of typography, learning about the shapes that make up letters and words and their visual effect on the reader.  Peckolick quickly fell in love with typography’s peculiar logic. “If a word was a beautiful word,” he told HuffPost, “it wasn’t the sound of the word that intrigued me but the look of the word. I saw each letterform as a piece of design. Cat is not ‘cat,’ it’s c-a-t [...] Letterforms themselves can support the visual idea of what the message is.” After graduating from Pratt in 1964, Peckolick entertained a brief stint in advertising before becoming an assistant to legendary designer Herb Lubalin, who would become his mentor and lifelong friend. Through Lubalin, Peckolick was introduced to typography’s preeminent pioneers: Saul Bass, Lou Dorfsman, George Lois, all of whom he befriended and learned from with zeal. “I got lucky,” Peckolick said. “Through a bunch of icons you meet a bunch of icons, and if you’re not careful you’ll become an icon yourself.” And so he did. At the time, lettering was traditionally understood as being subservient to graphics ― the caption beneath the image ― but Peckolick embraced the visual nature of the letters themselves, allowing them to speak up and talk back. Inspired by graffiti, hand-painted signs and text from other languages around the world, Peckolick crafted conceptual fonts without precedent, always imbued with style and a sense of humor.  Weber met Peckolick at a meeting of the art director’s club. They were both married to other people at the time. A few years later, they weren’t, and so they reconnected. “We were best friends first,” Weber said. At six-feet-four-inches, Peckolick had an imposing presence that sometimes intimidated strangers upon first meeting. But his personality, Weber said, was incredibly modest and even shy. “His looks belied the softness and the sweetness of him,” she said. “There was a little boy inside that frame.” The two wed in 1984 and celebrated their 33rd wedding anniversary in Dublin last month. “Every year we’d buy each other a tree or a plant, something that was forever,” Weber said. “I have all these trees that remind us of our time together. Alan was’t the kind of guy you bought sweaters for.” Later in life, Peckolick transitioned from graphic design to fine art, incorporating his love of letters into large-scale paintings that combined text with texture, color and composition. His work was exhibited at institutions like the Atlantic Gallery and the University of Baltimore in Maryland.  “He always had creative balls in the air,” Weber said. “When he didn’t have a project going, he would surprise me with an 18-foot fresco in our apartment. Frankly, it was challenging living with someone as talented as he was because there was always paint all over the house. It was like living in Jackson Pollock’s studio. He was a creative force, a hurricane in my midst.” In the last few years, Peckolick’s physical shaking increased as a result of his Parkinson’s, and, as a result, he moved away from painting the fine details of type. Still, he worked constantly. When he died, he was in the middle of working on a children’s book and a poster celebrating the 100th anniversary of Herb Lubalin’s birth. In his interview with HuffPost, Peckolick addressed his illness with humor and strength. “It’s a hard disease,” he said, “but I always say to people, if it really gets bad I can become an abstract painter.” Following Peckolick’s death, many have reached out to Weber, some of whom knew Peckolick personally, others who were inspired by his work from afar. “The incredibly creative way that he used type will hopefully inspire generations of designers to come,” she said. “I think he was one of the great typographic designers, there is no doubt about it. That’s his legacy.” Peckolick, described by his wife as “a delicious ice cream soda of stuff,” was a brilliant mind, a tireless creative spirit and a warm, generous person. He will be missed. "
ARTS & CULTURE,Julia Haft Candell Confounds The Infinite At Parrasch Heijnen Gallery,"After seeing its fabulous Peter Alexander sculpture retrospective last Summer, Parrasch Heijnen Gallery is on my “must visit” gallery list. The current solo exhibition Julia Haft-Candell: The Infinite is an example of the virtuosity that this gallery maintains. An exhibition comprised of new ceramic work, the show is divided into three neat sections beginning with a stunning take on the infinite. Alone in the first gallery and dramatically viewed from an elevated platform at the gallery’s entrance, one descends to approach Wall Infinity: Weave where spectacle meets reverence. What starts off as a reductive symbol slowly transforms into something more complex, stretching indeed toward the infinite. An assemblage of small porcelain plates forms the sign for infinity, but underglazed onto the symbol is a meandering weave pattern that neither begins nor finishes on the object. Infinity indeed. Much of what the artist is attempting in this show is to create forms that assert ambiguity (a paradox in itself, really). The infinity symbol contains lines that come and go, it is assembled (impressively) as a series of separate small plates, roughly matching at each edge to continue the form. Avoiding that holy grail quest for perfection that slays so many reductive artists, Haft-Candell gives everything she makes a textured, handled touch. In the second room, a larger space at Parrasch Heijnen, the artist presents two quite different bodies of work. On the North wall are twenty-four shelves containing a rather loopy array of black & white ceramic constructions. Each harkens to one of a few simple, primal shapes, imperfectly repeated here. An accompanying newsprint zine assembled by the artist goes through the litany of these forms and the details behind each of their glyph-like patterning. Each of these sculptures are masterpieces of the unresolved, functionless vessels with symbology and form merged on surface and in essence. One has to summon the poetic to deal with the absurd, and the rhythms of these undulating pieces inspire more than prose. Contrasting to the evidence of their all-too-human formation is the clean presentation from Parrasch Heijnen, installing individual precise trapezoidal shelves to accommodate the artist’s visionary impulses. Part three of the exhibit features a large platform holding five sculptures each titled Weight. These mounds of clay sitting as primary forces have vague splashes of chroma in the otherwise black & white show. And yet the color simply neutralizes the earthen tones of the clay, a subtle delivery of the message of nuance which resonates throughout this show. An association of these works with Peter Voulkos is inevitable, while her twenty four works against the wall seem formal heirs to Ken Price. It is no accident then that Haft-Candell is showing with Parrasch Heijnen whose website lists the late Price and Voulkos as their gallery artists. Both of these giants have had well-received shows at the Los Angeles space despite it having been open less than two years. Considering the presence of these two masters of the clay medium, Haft-Candell holds her own. In one modest exhibition she has a few major accomplishments: First, she establishes a wild pictographic language (applied with underglazing on black clay); she works to consistently make the enigmatic tangible in all her finished pieces, which finally makes even the reductive dichotomy of black & white into something more cryptic. Julia Haft-Candell is among the leading ceramic artists of her generation - this exhibit is the right art in the right place at the right time. The show runs thru September 2."
ARTS & CULTURE,West Bank Street Art Mural Trolls Donald Trump Over Mexico Border Wall,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s promised wall along the Mexican border may be a tall order, but at least he has left his mark on the Israeli security barrier that he has promoted as a model. On the concrete barricades erected by Israel around parts of Bethlehem, in the occupied West Bank, giant spray-painted images of Trump have given constricted Palestinians some comic relief. “I’m going to build you a brother,” the U.S. leader tells the wall in one mural. In another, he hugs an Israeli army watch-tower, with heart-shaped emojis added alongside paint splashes and soot stains left by Palestinian demonstrations. The artist, who goes by the alias @LushSux and who Australian media have said comes from Melbourne, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. On Thursday, the Washington Post published a transcript of a conversation in which Trump pressured Mexico not to publicly oppose his plan to have it pay for a border wall that he says is needed to stop illegal immigration to the United States. “You know, you look at Israel – Israel has a wall and everyone said do not build a wall, walls do not work — 99.9 percent of people trying to come across that wall cannot get across and more,“Trump told Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, according to the transcript of the phone call in January. A post shared by lushsux (@lushsux) on Aug 4, 2017 at 12:00am PDT “Bibi Netanyahu told me the wall works,” he added, using Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s nickname. The Bethlehem wall has become a showcase of protest art voicing Palestinians’ fears that Israel’sWest Bank fence-and-concrete barrier is a land grab that may deny them a state. Israelis deem the project a bulwark against Palestinian attack. (Writing by Dan Williams; Editing by Angus MacSwan)"
ARTS & CULTURE,"At Creativity Explored, Adults With Disabilities Express Their Own Sexuality","“Everybody has a sexual nature to them,” curator Amy Auerbach explained during a phone conversation. “Just because someone has a developmental disability doesn’t mean that sense of sexuality is non-existent.” Auerbach works at Creativity Explored, a San Francisco-based nonprofit art gallery and professional working studio designed specifically for adult artists with developmental disabilities. The space, founded in 1983 by Florence Ludins-Katz and Elias Katz, encourages artists struggling with physical and mental conditions to hone a daily artistic practice and pursue careers as profitable visual artists.  “Some people think they are like children,” Auerbach continued. “The artists here aren’t. They have adult concepts and this is one of them.” Every couple of months, Creativity Explored puts on a new thematic exhibition featuring work from some of the approximately 130 artists in their roster. The current exhibition, “Exposed,” revolves around nudity, sexuality and the human body. While the female nude has been a recurring image throughout art history, the Creativity Explored artists offer unorthodox imaginings of the human body, which is privileged not for its adherence to Western beauty ideals but for its smells, flavors, mysteries and desires.  The show features work by six artists, men and women, working in drawing, painting and sculpture. For some artists, like 36-year-old Antonio Benjamin, the naked human body isn’t necessarily equated with sex. Benjamin draws boxy bodies like paper dolls, which he describes as chocolate, vanilla and strawberry, all existing in what he dubs a Neapolitan world. “When I’m drawing a naked body, it’s not sexual,” Benjamin told his visual arts instructor Judith LaRosa. “Mmm! Not about sex!” When LaRosa asked, in response, if the drawings were about what’s natural, Benjamin responded with an enthusiastic “yes.” “Sometimes I like to draw people that look like me,” he added. “Brown like me.” For other artists, however, the works do possess a certain erotic power. Like, for example, Camille Holvoet, whose pastel depictions of sugary treats and naked bodies bubble over with feeling of mouthwatering hunger. One of my favorite Holvoet pieces features two decadent slices of layered cake, topped with birthday candles. “I love you so much” is written on the first slice, “I like to hold your hand,” on the second.  For “Exposed,” Holvoet created colored pencil, ink and felt pen drawings on wood, depicting cross-eyed nudes with curly cue hair and drunken smiles. One, which she describes as a “fat goddess,” is a self-portrait.  “Drawing naked people reminds me of the dryer vent feelings,” Holvoet told Creativity Explored’s Ellen Dahlke, who relayed the comments. “It reminds me that I want to play with others. Go in their rooms if they leave the door unlocked and play with them, naked people.”  Holvoet went on to explain the intense reaction she experiences from smelling a laundry dryer, of feeling its heat. “I accidentally smelled it. I was too close. I smelled it, and then I went to Napa [State Hospital] again to get medicine,” she recalled. “It’s something connected to my brain with the laundry smell. A lot of people have connections like that between smell and sex.” For the 65-year-old artist, who is often suffused with feelings and urges she is unable to control or consummate, art provides the opportunity to exercise some of this energy. Making work that explores sexuality, Holvoet explained, “makes me feel more relaxed, more like it’s the present instead of the past. Let’s make some more [wooden sculptures of] body parts so I can get this dream of mine from last night out of my head!” “Let me put it this way, if there was no sex, there wouldn’t be nobody alive!” artist Thomas Pringle said. The 76-year-old, who has worked with Creativity Explored since 2006, uses expressive and imperfect lines to create drawings that provide insight into the full journey of their creation, missteps and all. Pringle’s watercolor figures often drop off mid-form, leaving an arm or leg unfinished like a spool of yarn unraveling. “When I make something, like a painting of a woman, it’s about sex. I use pictures, and I try to make it as a real body. I look for one that’s good-looking,” he said.  For artists like Pringle, the physical act of intercourse is an impossibility, yet the feelings of erotic desire and curiosity reman. Creative expression provides an alternate outlet for lust to crescendo and subside. “I got news for you, there’s sex already happening,” he said. “With my disability, for instance, I don’t know how [to have sex], but I got it in my mind. I’m still having sex, but in a different way.”  “Exposed” features work by Antonio Benjamin, Andrew Bixler, Camille Holvoet, Jose Nunez, Thomas Pringle and Kate Thompson. Curated by Amy Auerbach and Stephanie Rudd. The exhibition is on view until Sept. 28 at Creativity Explored in San Francisco. The work above is available for purchase on Artsy. "
ARTS & CULTURE,J. K. Rowling Wrongly Blamed Donald Trump For Snubbing A Boy In A Wheelchair,"J. K. Rowling has apologized for erroneously accusing President Donald Trump of refusing to shake hands with a boy who uses a wheelchair. The Harry Potter writer criticized the president after viewing this footage of Trump seemingly refusing to shake the outstretched hand of 3-year-old Montgomery Weer after a speech on health care in the White House on July 24.  “How stunning, and how horrible, that Trump cannot bring himself to shake the hand of a small boy who only wanted to touch the president,” Rowling wrote in a series of blistering tweets on Friday. “My mother used a wheelchair. I witnessed people uncomfortable around her disability, but if they had a shred of decency they got over it,” she added. “So, yes, that clip of Trump looking deliberately over a disabled child’s head, ignoring his outstretched hand, has touched me on the raw.” But on Monday, the acclaimed author backtracked and admitted she’d actually only seen an edited version of the clip ― and had commented on it without knowing the full facts. The full version of the video, below, shows how Trump actually greeted the youngster, who has spina bifida, shortly after entering the room: After deleting her first set of tweets, Rowling posted a series of four messages in which she apologized to Weer and his family. “I very clearly projected my own sensitivities around the issue of disabled people being overlooked or ignored onto the images I saw and if that caused any distress to that boy or his family, I apologise unreservedly,” she wrote. She notably did not apologize to Trump himself, however ― who has previously caught heat for appearing to mock a reporter with disabilities. Check out the tweets here: Re: my tweets about the small boy in a wheelchair whose proferred hand the president appeared to ignore in press footage, multiple /1 sources have informed me that that was not a full or accurate representation of their interaction. I very clearly projected my own /2 sensitivities around the issue of disabled people being overlooked or ignored onto the images I saw and if that caused any distress /3 to that boy or his family, I apologise unreservedly. These tweets will remain, but I will delete the previous ones on the subject. /4x Rowling, who has 11.4 million Twitter followers, often uses the microblogging service to blast Trump. Most recently, she called the president out on his sexist tweets, his blocking of celebrities, his climate change policies and for tweeting in the third person."
ARTS & CULTURE,Meet The 18-Year-Old Artist Now Showing In The Museum Of Sex,"Warning: This article contains nudity and may not be appropriate for work environments.  I met artist Taira Rice when she was speaking on a panel about the all-women erotic art exhibition on view at New York’s Museum of Sex, “NSFW: Female Gaze,” which includes her work. Rice makes ink and watercolor portraits of naked women whose bodies often go unvisualized in mainstream culture: women of color, women with body hair, women with round bellies and strong thighs and big areolas. During the panel, she spoke openly and passionately about taking to her sketchbook upon hitting puberty, drawing the beautiful women she didn’t find in magazines or television screens. I was floored when, during the talk, Rice disclosed that she was only 18 years old. I called the Harlem-based artist the following week, eager to learn more about her life, practice and plans for the future.  What are some of your early memories of making art?  My earliest memories of drawing are when I was in kindergarten. My parents tell me I used to make very detailed drawings of people looking back at themselves at the mirror. And what about viewing or experiencing artwork? Was that an important aspect of your upbringing?  I remember going to museums and seeing art all the time. There are lots of murals around my neighborhood. I have to shout out my mom and give her credit for exposing me to art. Both my parents are architects and draw very well. My mom draws naked figures a lot and she would take classes and force me to take them with her. I remember when I turned 11 she told me I was going to have to start taking nude figure drawing classes. She was like, you need to know about the body. I saw her work all the time around the house. Instead of sitting down and talking to me about the birds and the bees she just showed it to me through art. So you’ve been drawing nudes since you were around 11? When I went to middle school I started to draw mostly naked people. I had no idea why. I was growing into this new type of body, I didn’t understand it that well. I saw my older sister and was like, “She has boobs. I don’t.” I drew what I didn’t understand. What sort of insecurities were you dealing with at this (objectively miserable) time in your life?  I got taunted at school. Kids thought I was gross, they called me a lesbian. I never really questioned it. I didn’t change. How, if at all, did drawing affect the way you saw yourself? A lot of my drawings are based a lot off my body. It helps me be okay with my own body to draw it and put it out there on the internet. I’m not just doing it to hear the positive response and be like, “Oh, they like my body!” It’s for myself and for me to work on my own insecurities. It’s mostly an unconscious thing. Your work seems to have a similar effect on a lot of young women who see it, who also have mixed feelings about their own bodies. It definitely has to do with my ideas about black female sexuality and how it isn’t shown in mainstream media. They ignore women in general but black women especially because we’re seen as “less than” in may ways. I grew up with many strong black women who I looked up to. I wanted to show people like that.  Did you continue taking art classes as you got older? I did not take well to art classes at all. I felt like they were forcing their own styles and opinions down my throat. I was interested in shading and drawing light and proportional figures, not in someone telling me how to draw. Has your work changed a lot over the past seven years? Yes, when I started to actually understand what I was doing. In 8th grade I had gotten rejected from the major arts high schools in the city and I felt really discouraged. I took a hiatus and stopped drawing for three years. In 11th grade I got back on it and, to apply to college, I had to whip out a portfolio as soon as possible. I started drawing like a crazy person. I drew in a sketchbook every day. I realized the things I once had interest in had evolved. The style changed, I started thinking more conceptually. I’m doing a lot of watercolor and right now I’m starting to draw in this weird cartoon style. I’m chalking it up to me being very young and just exploring. What do you mean by thinking more conceptually? I’ve been drawing women’s bodies since middle school. Back then I’d see a picture of a naked lady and just start drawing it. It was really mindless. There really wasn’t a concept there. Now, even though I try not to think super hard about what I’m doing and just with the flow, I’ve learned the difference between nudity and nakedness. Nudity is me putting myself on display for a spectator to take pleasure in. Nakedness is just me being myself with no clothes on. I want to focus more on nakedness. The woman I’m drawing is not naked because she wants to attract the spectator and be sexual. She simply has no clothes on and is being herself. The concept started evolving around the end of 2016. I’m still kind of figuring it out. And who exactly are these women? I know some of your drawings are based on your own body, but what about the others? I pull from many different areas, looking women with breasts and hips and vaginas. If I see someone on the street and her body is interesting I think: “If she was in a pose like this, that would be interesting.” I pull from strangers and friends and family to create this type of woman who is different but relatable. I want people to look at and be like, “Oh, that kind of looks like my body. My stomach is that big, too.” The viewer feels comfortable with this woman and identifies with her and can feel good about herself through her. When you see a woman who inspires you, do you take a photo or draw from memory?  I study them for as long as I can and remember when I get home. Everything is a mixture of imagination and memory. I’ve never taken a picture and drawn it. Sometimes I go on Google and look up porn stars and use their poses for inspiration. Everything else is from imagination. You share a lot of your work on Instagram. Do a lot of strangers reach out to you with feedback? I get DMs every now and then. People send me things, like opportunities to send my work to magazines. People just message me sometimes and tell me they really love my art. I feel a lot of love and I really appreciate everyone who is helping me out and supporting me even though they don’t even know me. It’s really moving and beautiful and crazy. Do you remember how you felt when you were invited to exhibit your work in the Museum of Sex?  It was a normal day and I was going through my emails. I was expecting an email from Seamless! I saw I had a new email and that said URGENT. It’s from Marina from Vice [Ed. Note: Vice Media’s Creators co-curated the Museum of Sex exhibit] and she had this whole explanation of the show and said she wanted me in it. I was in a state of shock for so long. It’s super surreal. I never thought I would make it this far in general and to know it’s happening while I’m 18 is even crazier. It is crazy! Given how much you’ve already accomplished, what does success look like to you in the future?  I honestly don’t even know. I definitely love drawing. If I could draw every day and make money that would be amazing.  How do you feel being 18 years old, about to start art school, with a museum exhibition under your belt? I always feel weird because I’m young and doing a lot with my art. When I was young I was so antisocial. I didn’t want attention and I guess I still don’t. I know plenty of artists that are my age and are amazing and should be in museums too. But it makes me realize that, for girls like myself, there is no limit. Whatever your needs are ― your pleasures, your desires, your dreams. They can all happen. They’re all real. "
ARTS & CULTURE,The Most Jaw-Dropping Street Art From Bristol's Upfest 2017,"Bristol in southwest England was treated to a riotous explosion of color over the weekend. Buildings, boards and store shutters across its Bedminster neighborhood were covered in eye-catching and thought-provoking murals, stencils and paintings as more than 350 street artists descended on the area for “Upfest,” Europe’s largest live street art event. A post shared by Urban Paint Festival (@upfest) on Jul 28, 2017 at 9:58am PDT Renowned artists including Jody Thomas, Cheo, Buff Monster, Pahnl and Kobra were watched on by thousands of visitors as they braved rain showers to meticulously paint over last year’s works. The festival is now almost a decade old, having evolved from its humble beginnings as just a small gathering of friends in 2008. Check out HuffPost’s live-stream from the festival on Sunday, above, and a selection of the pieces below:"
ARTS & CULTURE,Download These Illustrations To Protest Discrimination Against Trans Community,"President Donald Trump tweeted Wednesday that transgender people will no longer be allowed to serve in the U.S. military, directly discriminating against thousands of individuals currently serving their country.  Trump’s message was quickly denounced by many as “shameful,” “bigoted” and “cowardly.” Some even pointed out that it was hypocritical for a man who /www.nytimes.com/2016/08/02/us/politics/donald-trump-draft-record.html?_r=0""}}"" data-beacon-parsed=""true"">deferred being drafted five times to prohibit citizens eager to fight for America from doing so.  New Yorker cartoonist Tom Toro made his opinion clear, tweeting a drawing of Trump looking aghast at a gender-neutral bathroom sign that appears to be giving him the middle finger.  Yeah, pretty much.

Readers are invited and encouraged to print them out and hang them on any and every bathroom door.  The image is also a reminder of Trump’s decision earlier this year to rescind Obama-era protections for transgender students that allowed them to use a bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity. Toro often uses Trump’s scandals, tweets and injustices as inspiration for his timely political cartoons. “I think all of us have a social responsibility to resist Trump’s destructive agenda in every way we can,” he said in an earlier interview with HuffPost. “Artists and comedians might get a lot of attention because we have a ready-made platform to express our views, but the creativity and humor of the spontaneous protests happening all across our country are far more powerful.” “It’s been so inspiring to see the witty, withering signs that people draw up, the eviscerating Twitter quips that get circulated, the imaginative forms of resistance people use to block the Republican bulldozer,” he added. “I’m just trying to do my small part.” Head to Toro’s website to download and print his images. "
ARTS & CULTURE,"A Sketch By Donald Trump Is Headed To Auction, Really","A sketch by Donald Trump is on the auction block this week. Yes, you read that correctly.  In 2005, Trump created a sketch of the New York City skyline for a charity auction benefiting global literacy. The style is, well, understated, featuring boxy buildings with triangle roofs arranged in a row atop an enigmatic double swoosh. The medium is some kind of Sharpie-esque marker and the signature, of course, is scrawled in gold.  Yet, the amateur artist did take one creative risk in his rendering, altering the Manhattan landscape so that Trump Tower dominates the view. In the real world, Trump’s skyscraper is the 64th-tallest skyscraper, but thanks to the power of art the building is front and center.  Trump has a contentious relationship with the art world, to say the least. Since the president’s inauguration, many have used creative means to call out Trump’s potentially troublesome business ties with foreign governments, his “abusive” health care plan, his disgusting comments toward women and his relentless tweeting. We doubt this sketch will do much for his paltry reputation in the art world, but, in all fairness, the frame is nice.  While six months in, Trump has the lowest job-approval rating of any modern president at this point, we sure hope he doesn’t pivot to art anytime soon.  The framed sketch is currently up for auction online at Nate and Sanders. The bidding ends July 27 at 5 p.m. PST. The starting price is $9,000."
ARTS & CULTURE,Street Artist Shows 'Courage Has No Gender' With Powerful Stencils Of Famous Faces,"Los Angeles street artist Meg Zany is using the faces of celebrated people to help break down gender stereotypes, with her new Kickstarter-funded project. Zany plans to paint the portraits of 10 famous people who have each shattered gender norms on commissioned walls across the U.S. for her “Courage Has No Gender” campaign. She wants to produce stencilled homages to Amelia Earhart, Ellen DeGeneres, RuPaul, Malala Yousafzai, Serena Williams, Becca Longo, Rain Dove, Danica Patrick, Laverne Cox and Taylor Swift in at least 12 different cities. Zany hopes the murals will “inspire and motivate” people who are experiencing tough times due to their gender, and also serve as a reminder “that we all need to take action and display our courageous sides.” “To be prominent, we must be active,” she added. The campaign, for which Zany is seeking $30,000 in funding via Kickstarter, has already raised more than $2,800. It ends on Aug. 15. Zany, who quit her corporate job to paint thought-provoking and politically charged street art full-time in 2016, told HuffPost the inspiration for the project came after she produced this piece of acclaimed aviator Amelia Earthart, who was the first woman to fly a plane solo across the Atlantic Ocean: A post shared by MegZany (@megzany) on Apr 29, 2017 at 8:20am PDT “The more I thought about it, the idea to start celebrating the people of today who are doing things outside of gender norms seemed like a natural progression,” she said. After drawing up a long list of potential candidates that she could paint, Zany whittled it down to just 10. “The people I chose are pushing the extremes of doing things outside of gender norms,” she added. Check out each of Zany’s proposed murals below, and visit her Kickstarter page here."
ARTS & CULTURE,Pulitzer Prize Winner Tony Kushner Is Writing A Play About Trump,"Tony Kushner is known for many things: He wrote the deeply resonant play “Angels in America,” a seven-hour, Pulitzer Prize-winning production about the AIDS epidemic under President Ronald Reagan. He co-authored the screenplay for the Oscar-nominated film “Munich” and penned the entirety of the screenplay for the Oscar-winning film “Lincoln.” His next project: A play about President Donald Trump. In an interview with The Daily Beast, Kushner explained that he’s in the beginning stages of developing a theater work geared around the “nightmare” that is Trump’s ascendance to the White House. He recognizes that it’s early to be crafting a play that addresses a man who’s been in office for only half a year ― “It certainly feels like folly that I or anyone else has a definitive understanding or comprehensive understanding of what going on.” ― but nonetheless, he’s writing it.  Here’s what we know: The play won’t necessarily center on President Trump; rather, it will take place in the two years before he was elected. And its pre-White House character won’t be symbolic like the Public Theater’s “Julius Caesar” figure, dressed to appear like Trump but not actually be Trump. Kushner’s Trump will unequivocally be Trump. So what does Kushner think of the man in charge? He’s the kind of person, as a writer, I tend to avoid as I think he is borderline psychotic. I definitely think that incoherence lends itself well to drama, but he really is very boring. It’s terrifying because he has all the power, but without the mental faculties he ought to have. I think he is seriously mentally ill, and the fact that he is in the White House is very frightening. “He is precisely the kind of person who you would not want to be stuck next to at a party,” he added, before affirming that comparisons between Trump and Hitler are not misplaced. “You can’t get away from how grotesque [Trump] is. Reagan was really disgusting too, but not as venal.” Kushner’s play might not be finished by the end of Trump’s first term. (“I find writing difficult,” Kushner said, giving budding playwrights everywhere some sense of hope.) In the meantime, those interested in reading a few other famous writers’ takes on the Trump era can check out Howard Jacobson’s Pussy, Naomi Klein’s No Is Not Enough, or stay tuned for Salman Rushdie’s The Golden House, out this September."
ARTS & CULTURE,"Musicals (Yes, Musicals) Are About To Shake Up Podcasting","By Charley Locke for WIRED.  True-crime investigations, fictional radio shows set in small towns, long-form obsessive pursuits of a reclusive fitness gurus — the biggest hits in podcasting in recent years have taken a lot of varied forms. But the latest one trying to jolt the industry is doing it using an even more unlikely genre than most: musical theater. On the surface, 36 Questions, which stars Hamilton alum Jonathan Groff, is a narrative podcast about a couple working out their marital issues through song. But for producers Zack Akers and Skip Bronkie, who produced the 2013 fiction podcast Limetown, it’s the first step towards a podcast channel built around experimentation. It’s the start of a master plan to lure listeners away from long podcast series and into a sprawling ecosystem of audio aimed at evolving what podcasts can be. “There’s an unlimited amount of ways to go right now, because the podcast form is so young and so pliable,” says Akers. “How can you mix up the form, how do you mess with the audience in an interesting way?” Akers and Bronkie first worked together as college roommates, studying film and TV at Tisch School of the Arts at New York University. After graduating, they went their separate ways: Bronkie worked as a creative director at Facebook and Pinterest; Akers produced sports documentaries. But 10 years later, in 2013, Akers came to Bronkie with an idea for a way to do the kind of work they’d pursued as undergrads without having to secure a Hollywood budget. “Standing on my train going to work, everyone on my subway car has headphones in: This is an audience,” says Akers. “So I called Skip and said we should do a fictional podcast and treat it like a film.” Bronkie, who had just read World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War, was game. His suggestion: An oral history podcast. RELATED: MISSING RICHARD SIMMONS IS GRIPPING. AND ALSO KINDA ICKY The team spent the next year writing and producing Limetown, a six-episode story about a town where all 327 inhabitants disappeared. Today, there are dozens of fiction podcasts: Homecoming, The Bright Sessions, four shows from the Night Vale Presents network alone. But when Limetown launched in July 2015, a reporter or researcher hunting through found footage wasn’t yet a trope. The show quickly developed a devoted following, making it to No. 1 on the iTunes charts. While producing Limetown, Bronkie quit his day job at Pinterest and decided to pursue their company, Two-Up Productions, full-time. For filmmakers, the cost of audio fiction — voice actors, studio space, sound engineers — seemed like a bargain. “It’s less costly than producing a television series or film,” says Bronkie. “Without the visual aspect, you can go into the studio for a single day and come out with a half-hour episode.” His tech background came in handy, too: Thanks to his time working at lucrative tech companies, the two were able to self-finance the $90,000 season of Limetown, recouping the costs afterwards through ads, a prequel novel, and optioning the TV rights to IMG. From Mimicking Movies to Mimicking Musicals After the success of Limetown, the pair went looking for something to create the same impact. Their solution? A musical. “When Skip suggested it, I laughed — why would we ever do a musical?” says Akers. “But I knew because I was scared and it was so different that it was what we needed to do as a company.” For a storyline, they landed on a couple using “The Experimental Generation of Interpersonal Closeness,” a list of 36 questions popularized by a 2015 “Modern Love” column, as a last-ditch effort to save their marriage. And because Limetown owed so much of its success to Akers and Bronkie’s experience as filmmakers, they turned to experts for 36 Questions’ musical aspects, bringing on composers Ellen Winter and Chris Littler, who spent the next 18 months writing it. READ MORE: APPLE’S NEW TRANSPARENCY IS HUGE FOR PODCASTS EVERYWHERE Writing a podcast musical was a unique challenge — even for Winter and Littler, who play together in Chamber Band, a project Littler describes as creating “story-oriented songs in established universes”. (Previous albums include Deities, where songs take place in Dungeons & Dragons, and Careers, set in the world of The Hunger Games.) An audio-only musical posed limitations: They had to cut a narrator role and an ensemble; they decided not to feature more than two voices in a scene, so listeners can track dialogue; they integrated orchestration into the action. (At one point, Groff’s character asks his wife to turn off a record player, thereby letting the audience know the couple doesn’t just have a string section playing live in their living room.) But the podcast format also had benefits. A typical Broadway cast recording sounds as it would from an orchestra seat: like the actors are singing 30 feet away. In a podcast, it sounds like you’re in the room with the actors. With exposition and dialogue interspersed with the songs, 36 Questions sounds like a little bit of both. “It’s very immersive — your ears are in the space with the characters,” says Winter. “It’s as if you’re on stage with the actors, surrounded by them,” adds Littler. Playing to the Base The journey of 36 Questions will end on July 24, after a three-episode run. That’s a short series by podcast standards, but Akers and Bronkie hope it’s enough to lure listeners in — and keep them around. To that end, they’re not releasing the episodes on a separate 36 Questions feed in iTunes, but rather on Two-Up’s podcast channel. That way listeners who subscribe to Two-Up for 36 Questions will automatically get whatever the company works on next. “Doing everything on one channel means we can keep a loyal fanbase,” says Bronkie. “You now have a home for these riskier, weirder ideas.” RELATED: TRUE CRIME PODCASTS BRING CLOSURE—AND MAYBE EVEN REFORM Podcast producers usually don’t pursue one-episode projects; one-offs make it hard to build a following and climb the iTunes popularity charts. When producers have successfully made shorter seasons, it’s often as part of a broader series with existing name recognition, like The Heart’s four-episode mini-series on sexual abuse. What Two-Up is doing is different. Akers and Bronkie want their feed to use a variety-channel approach, retaining listeners who like their style while experimenting with genres that don’t fit into the serialized mold. Two-Up’s next project, for example, is a 75-minute “audio film” about weather vane thieves, ham radios, and “flawed characters making bad choices in 1979 rural Maine,” out at the end of 2017. And because of the relative cheapness of podcast production, they can try a lot of things and draw in new ears along the way. “The entry point of indie filmmaking is so high — it’s so hard to reach an audience of significance,” says Akers. “Podcasting, with this channel, cuts through a lot of that, and gets to a bigger audience very quickly.” They’re cagey about future podcast ideas beyond the feature-length project, but committed to experimentation — and to maintaining a filmmaker’s perspective. “We want to make something that sounds like a movie for your ears, cinematic and rich,” says Bronkie. To find out what that sounds like beyond musicals and found footage mysteries, you’ll just have to re-up Two-Up.

ARTS & CULTURE,"Gallery-Goer Loses Balance, Knocks Over So Many Pedestals Of Art","A visitor to 14th Factory art gallery in Los Angeles lost her balance while posing for a photo, accidentally initiating one the more costly games of dominoes to ever exist.  Watch in the video below as a row of artworks by Hong Kong-based artist Simon Birch go toppling to the ground, one after another. It’s both cringeworthy and mesmerizing. According to Hyperallergic, the damage added up to approximately $200,000. Be careful out there, art lovers. And don’t do this. Or this. UPDATE: Since the video has been making the rounds online, publications including The Guardian have speculated that perhaps the video is some sort of stunt. The video was posted to YouTube Thursday by a mate of Birch's who goes by ""Party Pooper,"" along with a caption urging viewers to check out the exhibit ""before it closes end of July (or before a few more pieces break)."" A representative for 14th Factory told CNET the gallery was not responsible for sharing the video, but it is notable just how perfectly the blunder was captured on tape.

ARTS & CULTURE,"In Good News, The Metropolitan Museum Of Art Set A New Attendance Record","We’d like to take a brief hiatus from the seemingly endless onslaught of daunting news about the future of our nation ― er, and human civilization ― with a sunnier report. The Metropolitan Museum of Art set a new attendance record this year with 7 million visitors, up from last year’s count of 6.7 million. It seems that, despite all the garbage going on in America, or perhaps because of it, people are turning to art for comfort and stimulation. America loves art! Woo!  The museum released the figures yesterday, which, as reported by Hyperallergic, encompass the institution’s fiscal year that ended on June 30. The attendance count combines attendees of the Met Fifth Avenue along with the Met Cloisters and the Met Breuer. The Breuer, which exhibits modern and contemporary art, opened in March 2016. That museum, housed in the former Whitney Museum building, drew 505,590 visitors with its inaugural shows last year ― including an exhibition of unfinished artworks and a stellar retrospective of Kerry James Marshall.  The majority of The Met’s guests, however, paid a visit to its Fifth Avenue location. The most popular show, “Age of Empires,” featured a massive trove of ancient Chinese archaeological finds. The second most frequented offered a glimpse into the dreamlike closet of avant-garde Japanese designer Rei Kawakubo. (Note: If Rihanna wears a work of art, people will flock to see it IRL.) It’s been a turbulent year for the arts, with the current presidential administration threatening to gut what little arts funding there is. The Met has had its fair share of controversy as well, with its former director Thomas P. Campbell resigning in February. So it’s heartening to know that, despite the struggle, The Met continues to draw New Yorkers and visitors from all over the world to its hallowed halls.  Congratulations, dear Metropolitan Museum of Art. You earned it! "

ARTS & CULTURE,'1984:' Even Scarier Than Real Life,"Sometimes we all need a good slap upside the head -- a slap that stings the eyes but clarifies our vision for an instant, a slap that hurts. A wake up, eye-opening, smack. The new Broadway production of George Orwell’s decisive dystopian novel, Nineteen Eighty-Four, delivers such a slap. You may find your eyes watering but you won’t be weeping. I believe George Orwell would have appreciated the impact of this production. It is no fun and neither was Orwell, from what I have read. The issues he grappled with were simply too serious for Orwell to be otherwise. Yet, the author of Nineteen Eighty-Four and Animal Farm was hardly humorless.  By the time he penned his defining final works of emphatic totalitarian dissection, in 1949 and 1945, respectively, Orwell – who died in 1950 – had figured out how to edify, unsettle and entertain a reader simultaneously. The Broadway iteration that opened as 1984 last week at the Hudson Theatre, adapted and directed as it was in its original London incarnation by West End wunderkinds Robert Icke and Duncan Macmillan, seems determined to similarly shake us up and down. Since many, if not most, of us are arriving at the Hudson Theatre already pretty shaken by the events and personalities of our day, this theatrical objective might seem redundant. In the end, however, it just feels cathartic. Broadway’s stage 1984 works as Orwell’s novel does: with disrupted language, with “doublethink” and “thoughtcrime” and “memory holes” here made horrifyingly, tangibly visual and audible via a high-tech arsenal of shock and awe lighting, sound design, video projections and, yes, with blood. There is a whole mess of blood by the time the curtain comes down. Yet, the pain inflicted by this 1984 is far more grippingly sensory than it is gratuitously gory. The attack is by no means perfect. When dramatizing the actual narrative of the novel, 1984 is most effective. When deploying a rather over-elaborate framing device, which I will not divulge here, the distance gained on the novel seemed to me inconsequential, if not downright condescending. Chalk it up, I would wager, to a perceived, yet utterly unnecessary, need to remedially boost up ticket buyers entering with little or no knowledge of Orwell’s original. Toss it out, I suspect, and no-one would be the wiser. The performances are terrific. As Winston Smith, the neo-heroic protagonist (quite likely named by Orwell, I must point out, for Winston Churchill), Tom Sturridge is far more dazed and confused than I would have imagined from reading the book, but there is something in the shaping of this performance by Mr. Sturridge and his directors that invites the audience in while, ultimately, leaving no way out. It’s creepy and, at times, rather frustrating. But it works. Olivia Wilde, as Winston Smith’s conspiratorial inamorata, Julia, is altogether inscrutable, which also works. At times I yearned for an emotional expression I could absolutely grasp to my heart but that is not what this 1984 is after. Virtually every gesture in the show is open to interpretation and designed to leave the audience reeling and wondering. “Orwellian,” in other words. My dear friend Reed Birney seems to deliver a new pinnacle career performance with every new production that he graces. His work in 1984 as Big Brother’s torture-wielding master operative, O’Brien, is truly terrifying entirely because of Reed’s restraint. How does an actor walk the line between calm and vicious action so precisely that we feel the tension until it almost becomes unbearable? Reed demonstrates this exquisitely.  1984 did provide me with one tangential wisp of reassurance. O’Brien may be all-seeing, serenely all-knowing and dangerous as a snake, but he is fictional. Even as 1984 delivered its fearful wake-up slap, I found myself thinking that not every real-life authoritarian demagogue is as smart, capable and effective as a George Orwell character. This was, for me, a tiny, wishful, saving grace. "
ARTS & CULTURE,Chicago Artist Carefully Placed 'Real Fake' Sculpture Outside Trump Tower,"Those who paid a visit to Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago this week likely noticed a newly installed statue just outside President Donald Trump’s namesake building.  The sculpture, the work of Chicago-based artist Scott Reeder, simply reads “REAL FAKE” in metallic gold, uppercase letters. The artwork delivers a not-so-subtle dig at number 45, who has been frequently described as a “charlatan,” a “scam artist” and a “duplicitous demagogue.” Reeder’s piece was installed on Monday night by the Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events (DCASE), as reported by The Chicago Tribune, as part of the city’s Year of Public Art program. Just one day after the piece was installed, Trump was exposed for hanging fake Time Magazine covers with his face on the cover on the walls of his golf clubs around the world. It also references Trump’s ongoing assault on “fake news” media ― a designation he often slings at publications attempting to hold him accountable.  A post shared by Art Handler (@arthandlermag) on Jun 28, 2017 at 9:10am PDT The six-foot-tall artwork was first displayed at Art Basel in 2013, so, regardless of how fitting the Trump associations may be, the piece was made long before Trump was even a presidential candidate.  And yet the dig is more than evident. As Chicago city spokeswoman “coyly” told The Chicago Tribune, “what’s wonderful about art is that it is completely open to interpretation.” Reeder’s piece is not the only work of protest art scheduled to invade Trump Tower this summer. Chicago-based architectural firm New World Design Ltd. has plans to erect golden flying pigs that would obscure Trump’s logo from view.  Jeff Roberts, who is leading the firm, explained the motivation behind the work in a statement: “The references are many, from flying pigs and Miss Piggy comments to a taste for gold embellished interiors. Ultimately, this is a very rational design and is in direct contrast to the chaotic nature and bizarre antics of our current leadership.” A post shared by Jillian (@julianmantooth) on Jun 28, 2017 at 4:29pm PDT A post shared by brandon (@brandonbbbbbbb) on Jun 28, 2017 at 7:31pm PDT"

ARTS & CULTURE,12 Great New Books To Bring To The Beach This Summer,"A good beach read might be as ubiquitous a summer staple as sunscreen, but what makes a book a beach read is harder to define. Should it be fast-paced? High energy? Physically light? (Never mind emotionally ― tears are just salt water, anyway!) True, the label can be used as condescendingly as “chick lit,” but what’s wrong with beach reading? The fact is, we’re all just looking for the right book to keep us turning pages instead of drowsing off on the sand this summer, and that’s a perfectly valid quest. In practice, it means something a little different for everyone, whether it’s a thriller, a romantic comedy, or a family saga, so we’ve come up with a range of new books that might make the perfect companion for your next day trip to the shore. Bon voyage! As the title hints, Basu’s debut hinges on a sudden burst of good luck; a middle-class East Delhi couple suddenly comes into a fortune. Meanwhile, their son has headed to New York for business school, where he’s fallen into a romantic entanglement he fears his parents can’t accept. As the family attempt to navigate their status as nouveau-riche Indians in a globalizing world, they find their life more destabilized than improved by their newfound riches. ― Claire Fallon Buy it on Amazon or at your local indie bookstore. Aside from his regular, intense nightmares, rare-book seller Apollo lives a charmed life with his wife Emma and their newborn son.

ARTS & CULTURE,"Immigrants, They Get The Job Done In Amazing New 'Hamilton Mixtape' Video","Lin-Manuel Miranda premiered the music video for “Immigrants (We Get The Job Done),” a song off “The Hamilton Mixtape,” on Wednesday. While the mixtape features an all-star roster of rappers and pop stars covering and reinterpreting songs from Miranda’s hit Broadway musical “Hamilton,” this is the first video to drop. The song features verses by some of Miranda’s favorite rappers from around the world: K’naan is Somali-Canadian and Residente is Puerto Rican. Riz MC is British-Pakistani and Snow Tha Product is Mexican-American. The song’s title references one of the most repeated lines from the song “Yorktown (The World Turned Upside Down)” ― and probably from the entire musical.  Just days after the Supreme Court approved a tempered version of President Trump’s “muslim ban,” the video’s message rings loud and clear. Its lyrics and visuals powerfully describe the dire conditions facing refugees attempting to immigrate to, and make lives in, America today. It also highlights the immeasurable contributions immigrants have made to a country that continues to dehumanize them. One verse, translated from its original Spanish, reads: “We packed our entire house in one suitcase / With a pick, a shovel / And a rake / We built you a castle.”  A full translation of the Spanish verses is available on Genius, which also includes a brief intro by the man LMM himself. “This election cycle has brought xenophobia and vilification of immigrants back to the forefront of US politics. This is a musical counterweight,” Miranda wrote.  Watch the video above, and don’t miss Daveed Diggs’ appearance in the final seconds. "
ARTS & CULTURE,"Early Wedding Photos Had No Touching, No Smiles, No Hashtags","In February 1840, England’s 21-year-old Queen Victoria wed Prince Albert in a silk satin dress and white lace veil. The happy couple documented their big day with a wedding portrait, as many are wont to do. However, it being the mid-19th century and all, when photography was still in infancy, the royal family instead sat for an oil painting. Fourteen years later, technology had advanced and photography was en vogue. So Victoria and Albert pulled a move to which any devoted Instagrammer can relate: They dressed up in their wedding garb to take the posed, nuptials-themed studio portrait they never had. We only hope they uttered “studio portraits or it didn’t happen” while assuming the position.  The black-and-white image of the powerful couple staring stoically into each other’s eyes sparked a trend, which spread throughout the U.K. before heading to the states around 30 years later.  Collector and curator Frank Maresca has long been interested in wedding portraits of yesteryear; the way they captured moments of emotional intensity masked beneath the stringent guidelines of the genre. Each image depicts strangers in familiar costumes ― white dress, black suit ― their individual love stories humming deep beneath the surface of the near identical performances of matrimony.  “I am interested in the vernacular universe,” Maresca, who co-owns Ricco/Maresca Gallery, which specializes in contemporary, folk and outsider art, explained to HuffPost. Wedding portraits, the majority of which were taken at “mom and pop studios,” fit the bill. So Maresca began hunting for wedding photos, or specifically, cabinet cards, five-by-seven-inch gelatin silver or albumen prints mounted on illustration board. He found them on eBay, Etsy and in various flea markets, all eerily similar variations of Queen Victoria’s original. While collecting the images, Maresca noticed something unexpected. The vast majority of them, which date from 1885–1900, emerged from various big cities and small towns in Wisconsin. “The population of Wisconsin, for whatever reason, caught on to this tradition first and it became a fad.”  Maresca is exhibiting 100 cabinet cards at his gallery this summer in an exhibition titled “I Do, I Do.” The show will also feature vintage wedding cake toppers, made between 1920 and 1960. But Maresca seems most intrigued by the photos, the way they house intimacy within a shell of stoicism, they way they differ from, yet somewhat predict, the traditions of wedding photography we follow today. “Look at their faces,” Maresca said. “Go from husband to wife to husband to wife. See it as a film that represents marriage in Wisconsin over a period of time.” “I Do, I Do” runs from June 29 until Sept. 9 at Ricco/Maresca in New York."
ARTS & CULTURE,China Grants Medical Parole To Jailed Nobel Peace Laureate Liu Xiaobo,"BEIJING, June 26 (Reuters) - Chinese Nobel Peace Prize winning rights activist Liu Xiaobo has been released from prison on medical parole and is being treated in hospital for late-stage liver cancer, his lawyer said on Monday in messages seen by Reuters. Liu, 61, was jailed for 11 years in 2009 for “inciting subversion of state power” after he helped write a petition known as “Charter 08″ calling for sweeping political reforms in China. In December 2010, Liu was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his activism promoting human rights in China, causing China to freeze diplomatic ties with Norway. China and Norway normalized ties in December last year. Shang Baojun, Liu’s lawyer, confirmed the news of Liu’s treatment in the city of Shenyang, and said the medical parole had been approved, in messages seen by Reuters. When asked about Liu, China’s foreign ministry, the only government body that will regularly answer questions from the foreign media, said it was not aware of the situation. The public security ministry and justice ministry did not immediately respond to faxed requests for comment. Liu Xia, Liu’s wife who has been under effective house arrest since her husband won the Nobel Peace Prize, is suffering from depression but has been allowed to visit him in prison about once a month, a source close to the dissident told Reuters. Liu was not allowed to attend his father-in-law’s funeral last year and his mother-in-law’s funeral this year, said the source who asked not to be identified. Liu had been incarcerated at Jinzhou Penitentiary in Liaoning, his home province in northeast China, before being moved to the hospital for treatment. A man who answered the telephone at the Shenyang hospital where Liu is being treated said he could not check information on individual cases as there were too many patients in the hospital. Rights group Amnesty International also confirmed the news of Liu’s illness in a tweet. Amnesty International’s China Researcher, William Nee, said authorities should ensure Liu was receiving adequate medical care and he called for the immediate and unconditional release of Liu and his wife. “Obviously, it’s a shameful situation and it’s incredibly sad to see one of China’s most prominent intellectuals suffer from such a terrible illness when he never should’ve been detained in the first place,” Nee said. He also called for the Nobel Committee and the international community to speak up “forcefully” for Liu now. Tibetan writer and family friend Tsering Woeser said she had been in tears after reading reports of Liu’s illness online. “I’m shocked and deeply saddened,” she told Reuters. “All we can do now is pray for him.” In Oslo, the Norwegian Nobel Institute, which oversees the Nobel Peace Prize, declined to comment on reports of Liu’s hospitalization. “Our policy is that we do not comment on individual laureates,” an official said."
ARTS & CULTURE,A Retrospective On 'Harry Potter' Midnight Release Parties,"If you ask a diehard “Harry Potter” fan where they were at midnight on July 21, 2007, they’ll know: Waiting at a bookstore to snag a copy of the final “Harry Potter” book, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, to read it as fast as they possibly could. To be a “Harry Potter” fan is a wondrous thing, but there’s a point of pride that comes with being a Potter fan from the start. For one, there’s that ineffable feeling of being able to say, “I’ve been enjoying this series since the beginning and I have watched it grow.” But it also means you were there for the midnight book drops. Local booksellers and global ones, like Barnes & Noble, led these drops for the final four books in the “Harry Potter” canon. For the uninformed, they went like this: You and your friends or family would deck yourselves out in “Potter” universe-themed regalia (which could be as simple as pair of Potter glasses or donning House-specific colors) the night before the day of a book release. Then you’d head to your local bookstore to get in a (usually long) line — unless you reserved a book beforehand. Once admitted into the bookstore, plastic bracelet swirling on your wrist, you’d have lots of options for what to do to kill the time before midnight when you could get your hands on the fresh pages. You could run to the cardboard cutouts of book covers to be photographed, comment on fellow readers’ costumes, get your face painted, exchange theories ― each store had different offerings, but all were “Potter”-specific festivities. After you’d partaken in your share of events and midnight arrived so you could score your copy, you’d get home as quickly as possible so as to devour the book before a “friend” could spoil any of the newness before you got to it. These drops were often touted as parties, primarily because the happenings within the stores were party-esque, but also because the general atmosphere and joyous attitudes of expectant readers facilitated it. Original “Potter” fans know the excitement leading up to each and every book drop, an enthusiasm that reached a crescendo when the books were finally in their desperately curious hands.  But it took a bit of time to get there. The midnight release parties didn’t exist until 2000 ― three years after the first book in the series was published. That delay can likely be attributed to Americans who were late to the party in getting ahold of the books, only being exposed to the first novel ― Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone — in August 1998, a full year after its release in England. Though, once Sorcerer’s Stone (or Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone, as it’s known in the U.K.) crossed the ocean, it made serious waves. It was on The New York Times bestseller list for more than 40 weeks, with its hype only growing once Chamber of Secrets and Prisoner of Azkaban landed on stands.  By the end of 1999, Pottermania around the globe was in full swing. Booksellers chalked up the newfound obsession to reliability and the admirable qualities of the story’s protagonist, but, above all, they knew they had a fire on their hands that could easily be stoked. In 2000, the publishers put into motion a midnight release for the series’ fourth installment, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. Thus, the midnight book drop parties were born. And they didn’t stop in bookstores. At that point, the late-night Pottermania flooded over to movie theaters. When the first “Potter” film came out in 2001, it cast an even wider net for the fanbase to expand and allowed for the film franchise to subsequently create its own iteration of midnight release parties for the film premieres. Theaters all over began to look like the hallways of Hogwarts. Despite the hype of the films carrying over until 2011, when the last one was released, one could argue that the true “end” of Pottermania was in 2007. (Others can argue it’s ongoing, but that’s a discussion for another time). Sure, there was a brief resurrection in 2016 when “The Cursed Child” came out, but it’d be careless to not acknowledge the massive sea change. When the first “Harry Potter” book was released in June 26, 1997, it was in an age where the internet was still considered uncharted territory. Most cell phones did nothing more than make calls, and bookstores were the primary locale for book buying. Even 10 years later, in 2007, the iPhone was still in its infancy, e-readers weren’t mainstream, and brick-and-mortar bookstores like Borders and Waldenbooks were thriving. In that era, the midnight book parties could prosper because there was something to be gained by obtaining a tangible book: You’d be one of the first to get it. Had Instagram existed then, posting a photo of your “Harry Potter” book would have surely been worth its weight in likes and social currency. But with digital book sales reigning in today’s book market (though at questionable rates) and online publishers releasing spoilers at lightning speeds, there isn’t a franchise today that’s harnessed that same spark that “Potter” fans emitted. That era, 1997 to 2007, was truly a sweet spot for readers. They watched the fandom bloom from nothing, lined up willingly outside of a physical store ― oftentimes without a celebrity-sighting incentive ― and read without the fear of a push-alert or Twitter spoiler. It was pure magic and all was well. In honor of the 20th anniversary of the very first “Harry Potter” book, we’ve rounded up a selection of photos that harken back to the golden era of “Potter” fandom. If you’re inclined to take a trip down Diagon Alley memory lane with us, please enjoy these Potter flashbacks of parties past. From June 1 to 30, HuffPost is celebrating the 20th anniversary of the very first “Harry Potter” book by reminiscing about all things Hogwarts. Accio childhood memories."
ARTS & CULTURE,Redesigning The Rust Belt: An Old German Steel Region Gets A Mindful Modern Makeover,"            Phoenix Lake, Dortmund’s coolest new quarter, was once an abanonded steel mill surrounded by polluted waterways and brownfields.  Frank Vincentz/Wikimedia (CC BY-SA 3.0) (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0)], via Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA     Christa Reicher, Technical University of Dortmund  The world is urbanising at a pace never before seen in human history. By 2050, 66% of the world is projected to live in cities.  In the developing world, this rapid explosion in urban populations has strained the absorption capacity of cities and led to shortfalls in housing, transport, plumbing and other services.  Europe’s cities face a somewhat different problem. The continent urbanised and industrialised centuries ago. Today, major urban centres that grew up on manufacturing must reinvent themselves for the 21st-century economy.  Given the large scale of modern urban areas, which are more borderless metropolitan regions than self-contained cities, designing these Europolises of the future necessarily involves numerous states, cities, towns – and, ideally, the millions of citizens that live in them. How can so many people and institutions work together to rethink their region both spatially, in terms of its physical layout, and culturally, in terms of its new identity?       The view of Europe at night clearly reveals the regionalisation of cities, which have become more a network of centres than a single urban core.         Among several useful European redevelopment experiences, that of Germany’s formerly industrial Ruhr region, which began its reinvention in 2011, stands out.  With its 53 cities and municipalities, and five million residents, the region is one of Europe’s five largest population centres. Once upon a time, it was one of the top heavy industrial areas in the world, producing steel, coal and iron.   The Ruhr is no classic metropolis. It is comprised of numerous loosely connected cities, towns and neighbourhoods interwoven with a variety of open spaces, including dormant steel factories, landscapes decimated by coal mining, rivers and brownfields.  In urban planning terms, this is what’s called a polycentric urban region without a dominant core city. The Ruhr is also demographically diverse, with communities at different stages of development and income levels in close proximity, and infrastructure mostly dating from its industrial days.  Germany is determined to bring this post-industrial region into the modern global economy. And it wants to do so in a way that takes both climate change and citizens’ radically wide-ranging needs into account: urbanism on different levels and at different speeds.   These are the challenges facing the Ruhr Regional Planning Association (Regionalverband Ruhr, or RVR) in designing a new regional plan that will soon become the shared development guidelines for all of the region’s 53 municipalities, including 11 independent cities and four counties, in the coming decades.  The plan will replace parts of three existing regional plans where they overlap with the RVR’s area. But rather than go to battle with residents and the dozens of local powers that be (from mayors and governors to businesses), the planning authority has decided on an innovative process based on consensus-building.  All municipalities, local universities and citizens have fed into the plan to turn this former industrial centre into a modern conurbation. The project is also designed to account for the region’s changing demographics, as long-term residents once employed in its factories and mills are replaced by university students, young professionals and immigrants.  Little by little, section by section and with ever-changing working groups collaborating on each development project, the new Ruhr is coming together.  For the recently completed Phoenix Lake redevelopment in the city of Dortmund, a developer teamed up with the regional planning association and citizens to convert a polluted former mill area into Dortmund’s newest urban quarter.       The Phoenix Lake master plan as projected in 2006.  Tbachner/Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA      An abandoned factory was replaced with a 24-square-hectare artificial lake designed for swimming and water skiing, and polluted tributaries were scrubbed. New housing went up, built in an architectural style that simultaneously fits in with the modern landscape and recalls the region’s past as a steel centre.   The Phoenix Lake project is an example of two-scale urbanism: the successful convergence of high-quality small projects with a broad and long-term regional vision.  In employing this participatory strategy, the Ruhr region is closing the gap between disciplines: everything from urban theory and environmental studies to economics has been fed into its development plan.  It also demonstrates that communities can work on different levels at the same time, transferring knowledge from the neighbourhood level up to the regional level and implementing regional infrastructure in individual cities.  Because of this discursive style, the Ruhr’s final redevelopment document could deliver answers to the challenges facing many cities and regions around the world, from rapidly expanding Accra and shrinking, struggling Detroit to cities that, like Vancouver, are seeking to become “green”.       Like Germany’s Ruhr region, Detroit is struggling to reinvent itself after the decline of the manufacturing economy that built it.  Albert Duce/Wikimedia, CC BY-SA      Often, what we perceive as dualisms – growing developing-world metropolis versus shrinking manufacturing hub, or booming metropolis versus controlled-growth smart city – are not so different. Rather, they reveal spatial contradictions within the urban transformation processes that all cities are likely to experience at various points in their history.  Listen here: Christa Reicher on Detroit and what the Ruhr can learn from it.  Author provided (No reuse)1.73 MB (download)     In many global cities, for example, two seemingly contradictory shifts are currently underway: reurbanisation and regionalisation.  City centres are booming as young professionals and older generations, who may have left the city to raise their children, are rediscovering urban life, in no small part because people prefer not to spend hours commuting from suburb to downtown and back every day.  At the same time, cities are regionalising. The urban sphere is expanding into surrounding areas, and new multi-functional locations outside of traditional cores are arising.  With the new “aerotropolis” model of economic development“, for example, we see mega airports, often located between two cities, offering not just hotels but also conference, meeting and even living spaces. Such ""airport cities” are planned or completed near Amsterdam, Dubai, Paris, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Beijing, Memphis and elsewhere, according to the 2011 book Aeorotropolis.    As long as the reurbanisation and regionalisation trends continue apace, the world will see ever more regional conurbations that, like the Ruhr region, have numerous, interconnected “centres”. This is the geography on display in the sprawling metropolitan region of São Paulo, Brazil, with its 39 municipalities and combined population of 21.5 million, and in the New York tri-state area (population 20.2 million), which encompasses large swathes of New Jersey and Connecticut.       With dense settlement as far as the eye can see and numerous ‘centres’, Sao Paulo is a classic example of modern connurbation.  Chensiyuan/Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA      As the Ruhr’s experience has shown, it is no simple thing to respond to these different trends at all the scales present in the region, but it is possible. The local must be connected to the regional at different points – urbanism on two scales, progressing at two different speeds.  To design change in the interest of most citizens – and with visible achievements on all levels – is the core challenge in the Ruhr, and beyond.

ARTS & CULTURE,Theater Community Receives Death Threats Following 'Julius Caesar' Controversy,"The Public Theater’s production of Shakespeare’s “Julius Caesar” featuring a Donald Trump-like lead has closed, but the controversy circling the play remains.  According to The Associated Press, police are currently investigating threats made to the wife of the play’s artistic director, Oskar Eustis. Eustis’ wife filed a complaint on June 9 about threatening phone messages she received. One caller, the AP reports, said he or she “wanted her to die after saying her husband wants the Republican president to die.” The production, which ran last week as part of the annual free Shakespeare in the Park festival held in Central Park, incensed critics with a Julius Caesar character bearing strong physical similarities to Trump. As a result, some alleged that the play’s iconic scene ― during which Caesar is assassinated ― sanctioned or even encouraged violence against the president of the United States.  However, anyone who has actually seen or read the 400-year-old play ― or listened to director Eustis speak on the matter ― knows that it unequivocally denounces political violence of all kinds. Shakespeare’s message strongly warns that democracy can only be upheld through democratic means, casting Caesar’s stabbing as an illegitimate act of misguided patriotism. As Eustis summarized to The New York Times: “This production is horrified at his murder.” Nonetheless, anger surrounding the play has escalated over the past weeks, climaxing when rightwing protesters interrupted a performance last Friday, one storming the stage and another standing up amid the crowd to scream “You are Nazis.” Sadly, Eustis’ wife is not the only individual to be threatened as a result of the theatrical dispute. Other Shakespeare theater companies around the nation, completely unattached to The Public’s production, have been mistakenly targeted.  Stephen Burdman, artistic director at New York Classical Theatre, described some of the “hateful emails” the company received. “Every arts organization gets critical correspondence,” he told HuffPost. “But normally, they are very well crafted and certainly not vitriolic or threatening. These were outrageously threatening, lots of ‘you should die’ and lots of expletives. Once they started threatening families I didn’t even want to share them with my wife.”  Burdman is not alone in receiving disturbing messages intended for The Public. Last week the Washington Post reached out to Massachusetts’ Shakespeare & Company, which, perhaps due to its domain name Shakespeare.org, was also the target of threats. One read: “F— you, hope you all who did this play about Trump are the first do die when ISIS COMES TO YOU f—– sumbags [sic].” Artists around the world have expressed their support for the play, stressing the importance of free expression and political theater. The Public released a statement last week, declaring it stands by its production: We recognize that our interpretation of the play has provoked heated discussion; audiences, sponsors and supporters have expressed varying viewpoints and opinions. Such discussion is exactly the goal of our civically-engaged theater; this discourse is the basis of a healthy democracy. Our production of “Julius Caesar” in no way advocates violence towards anyone. Shakespeare’s play, and our production, make the opposite point: those who attempt to defend democracy by undemocratic means pay a terrible price and destroy the very thing they are fighting to save. For over 400 years, Shakespeare’s play has told this story and we are proud to be telling it again in Central Park. There is something painfully ironic about unleashing violent threats to protest what is perceived by some as an endorsement for violence. Hopefully now that the production has finished its run, the vicious and often misplaced attacks on members of the theater community and their family will come to an end.   "
ARTS & CULTURE,Every 'Simpsons' Superfan Should Follow This Surreal Instagram Account,"When it comes to TV shows with hallucinatory visuals that verge on abstract art, “Twin Peaks” gets all the credit. But in the small suburb of Springfield, between the delicious donut breaks and mischievous youths, there are brief moments of confounding beauty, too. Yeah dude, we’re talking about “The Simpsons.”  A “Simpsons” fan who prefers to remain anonymous has been compiling the most quietly captivating moments from the show under the Instagram handle @scenic_simpsons. Some of the still scenes he or she posts zoom in on background objects, turning them into momentary paintings ― a television screen or the interior of a fridge. Others depict an unfixed wash of pastel colors, the abstract smattering of cartoon hues that feels both nostalgic and unknown. We imagine Salvador Dali and Philip Guston would be very down.  A post shared by Scenic Simpsons (@scenic_simpsons) on Apr 17, 2017 at 12:31pm PDT The curator began the passion project after being mesmerized by a particular frame in the show, in which Homer’s face is reflected through a glass of water. “I just loved the way that the animators created this image and all the details within the scene,” the curator told It’s Nice That. “The plant in the corner, the strip lighting, the blind and calendar on the wall in the background. It just went from there really. I began to appreciate the scenes and setups on a whole other level. Now the ones I like the most are those without characters.” The account is updated every few days, focusing on the show’s “golden years” between Seasons 1 and 10.

ARTS & CULTURE,Art Of Iranian Immigrants Reveals The Creative Potential Of Inclusivity,"In January, President Donald Trump issued an executive order denying citizens from seven Muslim-majority nations entry into the United States. In the months since, multiple courts have deemed the ban unconstitutional, arguing that it discriminates against Muslims.  Yet Trump is still pushing strongly for the directive, filing an emergency request with the Supreme Court earlier this month and penning increasingly incensed tweets expressing his frustration with the Justice Department.  Not long after Trump first announced his plans for the ban, art institutions around the U.S. responded to denounce the executive order as fundamentally opposed to values of inclusion, diversity and liberty. New York’s Museum of Modern Art made its convictions known by hanging work made by artists hailing from affected nations on its walls. The Davis Museum at Wellesley College used a different approach to convey a similar message. The museum temporarily removed all artwork made by or donated by immigrants from the museum walls.  The message behind both art world protests came through loud and clear: immigrants are indispensable parts of the fabric of this country, and their contributions to American civilization and culture are invaluable. Or, as Iranian-born, New York–based artist Nicky Nodjoumi put it: “Understanding the cultural exchange is very important at this moment. And so we have this show.”  The show is “Beyond the Ban,” on display at Susan Eley Fine Art in New York. A direct response to Trump’s order, the exhibition offers a lush visual argument for the benefits of inclusion, plurality and free expression, featuring work by 10 Iranian-born artists living and working in the U.S.  Nodjoumi, who curated the exhibit, was born in Iran in 1942. He relocated to New York City in the ’60s and became actively involved in protesting Iran’s Pahlavi regime. “When I came to New York I worked with political organizations,” the artist told HuffPost. “I didn’t do paintings for three years; I felt like painting was not enough. But at the end I realized this is my capacity. This is what I do best.” The artist received his master’s in fine arts from The City College of New York in 1974 before moving back to Iran to teach at Tehran University of Fine Arts. There, Nodjoumi motivated his students to be outspoken in criticizing dictatorial regimes and designed political posters visualizing the ethos of the Iranian Revolution. In 1981, he returned to New York but continued to tease out the trauma of his experiences with political oppression through painting.  Nodjoumi’s works are graphic but not straightforward, plopping familiar yet enigmatic images of wild animals, men in suits, long sticks and bright balloons into uninhibited backdrops. The carnivalesque images wrap political commentary in an absurd and slightly surreal fog, alluding to the eternal threats of power, tyranny and greed, untethered to a specific time or place. “I like my works to have a story, to have some drama, like they’re onstage,” Nodjoumi told HuffPost. “When I do larger scale paintings, the paint becomes dominant and takes over. I follow the rules of painting when a piece starts.” The New York nonprofit Center for Human Rights in Iran reached out to Nodjoumi to curate the “Beyond the Ban” show, with 90% of proceeds benefitting the organization.  “I didn’t want all the work to address the subjects of human rights and immigration,” Nodjoumi clarified. “I thought we should let the artists do whatever they want to do. There is a diversity of subject matter in the show. All of us are immigrants, and you can see the range in our cultures and the stories.” One such artist is photographer Hossein Fatemi, who, for a series titled “Veiled Truths,” photographed 20 women through a veil ― as in, he literally draped each subject’s hijab over his camera lens. The series responded to the controversial Iranian government dictate requiring women’s heads be covered in public regardless of how they identify religiously or how they comport themselves at home. Some of Fatemi’s more religious subjects wear the hijab on a daily basis, while some of his secular subjects felt repressed by the reigning government’s enforced modesty. In his photos, strangers’ portraits are overlaid with the embellished patterns of the hijab, obscuring the woman’s identity while enveloping her in a visual mandala. The simple formula questions the limits of religious observance and political mandates, examining the imprint they leave on one’s personal identity.  When selecting artists to feature in the show, Nodjoumi explained that his greatest worry was potentially endangering any participating artists. “In Iran, they don’t like my paintings,” NodjoumiI said. “If I go back to Iran, they might arrest me. When someone actively and openly criticizes the regime or asks for more tolerance, they don’t like it. It might be a problem for someone trying to go back and forth between Iran and the U.S.”  And yet he’s troubled by the threats of censorship currently confronting artists in America, as well. “I’m very concerned about freedom of speech here,” Nodjoumi said. “I’m here as an Iranian American to be part of that act of activism.” “Beyond the Ban,” then, tells no singular story and advances no particular agenda. In paintings, photos and prints, the works interweave Iranian artistic traditions with contemporary Western trends and innovations. The show hopes not only to encourage reflection on how we perceive Muslim-majority nations under Trump administration, but to emphasize the role art can play in uncertain political times.  “I’ve been here for a long time,” Nodjoumil explained. “I have experienced prejudice and discrimination with my work. I am familiar with being placed in a box; it’s a problem. But to be honest, I think there has been an attempt in recent years to expose more Middle Eastern artists, and that’s really great.” “Beyond the Ban” features work by Shirin Neshat, Nicky Nodjoumi, Nahid Hagigat, Shoja Azari, Shahram Karimi, Jason Noushin, Afshin Naghouni, Nazanin Noroozi, Raha Raissnia and Hossein Fatemi. The exhibition runs until August 30, 2017 at Susan Eley Fine Art. Those interested in donating to the Center for Human Rights in Iran, click here.

ARTS & CULTURE,American Teenagers Are Using Slam Poetry To Make Sense Of Trump,"Given the incessant pace of the internet, and the antics of the current presidential administration, staying up to date with American current events can be exhausting, if not harrowing. Earlier this month, after former FBI director James Comey testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee, the web was buzzing with familiar hot takes and political predictions, mostly rehashing the same quotes and questions. A young poet by the name of Gordon Ip, however, packaged his take on the breaking news differently, breathing new life into yesterday’s news. “Kushner, Flynn, where does the truth begin?” he said, words flowing with urgency and poise. “Suspicion in the wind, static in our sleep, demanding our dreams, unquestioned loyalty. Our country is full of ‘no questions, please.’” Ip is a member of Get Lit, a troupe of young poets who make and perform slam poetry in and around Los Angeles. The nonprofit organization was launched by Diane Luby Lane in 2006 as an effort to increase literacy among elementary, middle and high school students through spoken word. It’s working. Compared to the 77 percent graduation rate of students in the Los Angeles Unified School District, the second largest in the nation, 98 percent of all Get Lit Players graduate and go to college ― with 70 percent earning some sort of scholarship. Slam poetry, or spoken word, is part creative writing, part performance, a means to finding your voice and expressing it ― loudly. “Working with young people, it feels like you’re helping to shape someone’s idea of themselves,” Lane told HuffPost. “Young people are so open, their lives can go so many different directions. There are so many young people that are artists, writers, performers, who don’t know what to do with their talent. If they don’t have that avenue, what a waste. It can be the difference between getting a scholarship to college and dropping out of school.” For the past 20 weeks, the Get Lit Players have been participating in a series called “Get Lit NOW,” using current events as a springboard for poetry that melds the political and the personal, addressing national and global concerns in one unfiltered voice. Mila Cuda, a high school senior and newly elected Poet Laureate of Los Angeles, serves as the editor.  Topics broached in the series range from healthcare to climate change to rape culture, depending on the week’s most recent happenings. Each subject is communicated, however, through the singular perspective of the poet, translated into an embodied and impassioned language all its own.  “Writing about politics is something I’ve explored more recently,” poet Jojo Louis told HuffPost. “I had been seeing these shocking things on the news, but I never really wrote about them. Once I started, I realized how much my opinion matters. Poetry helps me spread the word about what I feel.” Louis, who is 19 years old, wrote and performed a piece addressing reports that President Donald Trump had ordered the launch of 59 missiles against Syria, which he initially misidentified as Iraq, while enjoying “the most beautiful piece of chocolate cake that you’ve ever seen,” as the president described.  Louis’ poem dramatizes Trump’s bizarre description of his dessert, as well as his inability to recall which country he had attacked. Louis blasts Trump’s machismo facade with a masterful mix of satire and solemnity. “Should we let them in? Lock them up? Shuffle up the deck and bomb the shit out of whichever card comes up?” he asks.  For the young poet, the challenge of making the political poetic rests in his ability to show the implications actions have on actual individuals. “When I see something on the news, I immediately think about how it directly affects me,” he said. “After that, I think more about its universal impact. I try to put my all into it: my experience, my story.” Another poet, 18-year-old Samantha Healy, addressed Syria in her poem, which she performed just after a gruesome chemical weapons attack left scores of citizens, many of whom were children, dead.  “We could fund the arts or tear the world apart,” Healy says, eyes burrowing into the camera. “Are we nationalists or just negligent? Are we nationalists or just negligent? Are we practicing policies of isolation? Trying to be bipartisan but only being bystanders? We are not innocent when we watch violent acts. And we are not innocent when we commit them.”  Like Louis, Healy is relatively new to writing poetry about political topics. “I usually wrote about my own personal experiences,” she told HuffPost. “When I first hear about something happening in the world, I am a very empathetic person, so there’s a lot of emotion. I immediately write down the emotions, then I get the facts down.” While poetry is often written off too quickly as elusive, elitist or out of touch, the Get Lit Players show the art form at its most urgent and accessible, words pumping with adrenaline. “Poetry has a level of honesty to it,” Louis described. “People bring more than just words to a poem. People bring their feelings. It can spark a fire in someone that influences their actions, or helps them look outside of their own personal experience.” Healy added that poetry is an especially potent medium for young people, who often encounter the art form when their lives and identities are still very much in flux. “You become part of a movement,” she said. “Everyone is so vulnerable and open; it creates such a healthy way to get through your pain. We’re changing something, we’re moving forward and we’re making a difference with our words and our honesty.” You can check out 20 young poets’ musings on political happenings through the Get Lit NOW Facebook page, and be sure to check back each week as a new poem is added.  Welcome to Battleground, where art and activism meet."
ARTS & CULTURE,The Dangers Of Climate Change Are Real In This New Comic Anthology,"In the past decade or so, a subgenre of dystopian fiction has emerged to confront our changing planet: climate fiction, or “cli-fi.” In stories like Jeff VanderMeer’s “Southern Reach” trilogy, or Kim Stanley Robinson’s New York 2140 and Claire Vaye Watkins’ Gold Fame Citrus, characters confront floods, droughts and other environmental catastrophes. But, as a recent post on the Smithsonian blog points out, these stories are swiftly becoming not just future possibilities, but present realities. In an interview with HuffPost, VanderMeer noted that, “the solutions a fiction writer can provide, the speculation, is perhaps edging toward offensive in a policy context ― because we have scientists telling us what we need to do and they are the experts.” A new cartoon anthology called Warmer ― which is currently seeking funding on Kickstarter ― addresses these issues and more. Co-edited by artists Madeleine Witt and Andrew White, the collection of works serves to provide support and hope to those who are mourning the damage done to the earth. In an interview with HuffPost, White said, “As co-editors of Warmer, Madeleine and I wanted to make a book to offer comfort for those already fearful about climate change. So for the most part, Warmer doesn’t aim to convince anyone of anything. We imagined Warmer in part as a book that will function to encourage and support activists; to comfort those who, like ourselves, are wrestling with the grief of climate change.” Below is a selection from five of the book’s contributors. “This piece about humpback whale migration is the beginning of a collaborative project between me and my dear friend Catalina Jaramillo, a journalist who writes environmental/sustainability stories,” Berg said. “Through this collaboration I hope to express our shared love and respect for the ocean and its inhabitants.” “There’s beauty in just surviving despite everything, and real shame in so selfishly leaving all this to our children and grandchildren. And it won’t be far off in the distance — it’s already happening,” Skaalrud said. “I both feel helpless for my very young friends who will navigate climate change as it worsens, and still want to practically prepare them as much as I can. As I always say, ‘I can at least teach you to ride a horse, shoot a rifle, and start a fire.’” She says that as an artist, she “can’t present a perfect argument or deeply considered treatise that would change anyone’s mind. I feel, if there’s anything I can do that will truly activate change, it’s touching people’s hearts.” “Often in my work I engage with disability subjects, but when it comes to an issue as overwhelming as climate change, I think everyone of every ability is confronted with how limited they are,” Anderson said. “It’s always such a powerless feeling, such a moment of frustrated desire for control over your situation. We are ultimately still responsible for our part in this, even if we can barely do anything to fix it all. It’s a contradiction that can’t be resolved, a feeling of smallness in a moment where we need to be big.” They continued, “Art has the power to expand our emotional understanding of the political, and this is an important form of activism. It’s a responsibility artists need to rise to.” “For me, art and activism are two occasionally overlapping streams that come from the same source,” Witt said. “They both come out of a desire to see true things expressed, broken things healed, justice enacted. This comic, in particular, is a kind of meditative experience; the moment of quiet prayer before entering the battle, a necessary attempt to grasp the enormity of climate change and my own feeling about it. This comic is a piece of the reflection that necessarily precedes action.” “My piece for Warmer adapts several Yoko Ono instructions from her books Grapefruit and Acorn. For example, one piece that I adapted reads, ‘Walk in the footsteps of the person in front. 1. on ground 2. in mud 3. in snow 4. on ice 5. in water. Try not to make sounds,’” White said. “I found these pieces very moving. I couldn’t stop thinking about them. The instructions call upon the reader to go out into the world. Ono asks us to see the world as it is — to experience its beauty, its fragility, its splendor. So I aimed in my piece to both instill in readers that desire to reach out towards the world, and to communicate my own feelings about interacting with natural beauty when I fear that beauty might be fleeting.”"
ARTS & CULTURE,What We Talk About When We Talk About Race: A New Play Shows It's Not What It Seems,"I flew across the country to see Christopher Chen’s You Mean to Do Me Harm, presented by SF Playhouse. I am glad I did. I booked my flight back from the East Coast to make it for the one night that I could see the show during its run. There aren't many plays like this.  I have been following Chen. He won an Obie for Caught, which had the distinction of running simultaneously in the San Francisco Bay Area, where Chen works, and New York City. That triptych deconstructed stereotypes Americans have of Chinese, and Chinese have of Americans, as well as the dubious interactions of the global art market. It was all about the ease of fraud, including that practiced on an audience gullible enough to accept the worst accusations about China, especially if accompanied by claims of creativity just this side of pretentious.  An earlier farce, Mutt, imagined a Presidential candidate being recruited for his race, specifically his mixed race identity. It premiered in the basement of a Berkeley pizza parlor. A mash up of film noir and science fiction, as if Raymond Chandler fell into Flatland, entitled Home Invasion, was put on in somebody’s actual living room.  All these pieces have entertained. None have been derivative.  Harm opens with two thirty something couples, one Asian male-white female, the other white male-Asian female, at a dinner party. The Asian male has hired the white male, or his buddy has, at a startup search engine firm intent on knocking off Google. The white male and the white female dated while in college, and, crucially, they once went camping. The Asian female beat out her own husband (the aforementioned white male) for a promotion at the non-profit where they reported to a South Asian boss, resulting in the man of the house being downsized out of work. Harm could be considered part of a recent series of cautionary tales about inviting people over for a meal. God of Carnage (a global blockbuster for Yasmina Reza in 2008) and Disgraced (Ayad Akhtar’s Pulitzer Prize winner, the most produced play of 2016), two other recent Broadway hits, demonstrated in detail how dinner parties can descend into hell or at least purgatory. In this instance, a random line of dialogue, which it turns out was the result of a nudge on social media, triggers latent racial resentment in a slow burn. The Asian male, born in China but an immigrant at an early age to America, perceives what nobody else does, that camping is more than setting up a tent in the woods. To him, camping is about who owns those woods — and by extension, his wife. As he explains, it’s not the same, you see, the AMWF combination and its mirror image, because the Asian male has been emasculated in the culture. In a subsequent conversation, the Asian female asserts that gender discrimination is worse than racial discrimination, for her, even if her illicit flirtation may compromise her message. The fun does not stop there though. Much discussion about race nowadays is about unconscious bias. We think we are talking about camping. But really we’re talking about race.  Except this script flips the script again — and again. Those who resist the notion that the unconscious is doing anything the conscious isn’t, well, conscious of, insist that they aren’t talking about what they’re being accused of talking about, and they aren’t thinking it either, for that matter. Underneath the camping, there is race. But underneath race, there is domestic conflict twice over. And, at the end, there is an invitation to smooth over all of the tension, of course, by camping. It’s too late by then. The play is about, as many plays end up being about, its own language. It’s about whether people mean what they say and say what they mean, and the consequences that follow, which generally suggest we are all better off avoiding if not the truth then the candid expression of it. We trick one another as much as we deceive ourselves. Otherwise we wouldn’t make it through the day without wishing to leave our spouses. Despite that, the story is not unduly didactic. In running time of under ninety minutes, it has the humor that is needed for the subject matter. The characters are real, if forced to be representatives of an unreconstructed ethnic nationalism. The Asian, indelibly Chinese characters, suffer from this more. They appear as assimilated as could be (she is native born), but they cannot help themselves in advocating for China. They seem to deny the possibility, for themselves, of being Chinese American.  The debate about camping escalates comically. It is a racial version of a MacGuffin, a device to drive the plot that need not have real significance, and it functions perfectly for the purpose. The Asian female, for example, is enthusiastic for the outdoors, as if she is trying too hard. She will mature into the “Tiger Mom” of camping, doing it to excess because it is expected. The truth is that in China, if one is to continue the generalizing that the conflict depends on, they are avid hikers. Yet until recently, with the achievement of critical mass as seen throughout national parks, Chinese on these shores did not have the safety of numbers to wander about in the wilderness. Chinese Americans, as distinguished from Chinese foreigners, residents rather than tourists, must be more wary about their surroundings. They are surrounded. That is what is unspoken. You could be shot. The San Francisco Bay Area theatre scene does not lack for risk taking. The SF Playhouse enjoys a high success rate. Its artistic director, Bill English, promotes his stage as an “empathy gym.” In this instance, they have produced another hit. Finally, the venue is worth mention. American Conservatory Theatre, the best established local company, renovated a defunct adult movie house, the Strand, in the mid-Market enterprise zone that City Hall has been promoting. The bright red building stands out. At its top, the punningly named Rueff — honoring the donors — shares an entrepreneurial spirit, hosting experimental work for smaller audiences. The Strand, in particular its Rueff, have become a place of adventure. They deserve patronage for the potential to bring back a neighborhood. Harm had an abrupt end. It was becoming apparent that there was not likely a means out of the recursive loop of recrimination, racial and marital, even through a dream sequence. But when the merry-go-round stopped, I said to my wife, “What? Is that it?”  It isn’t that common to care enough about characters in contemporary drama, to wonder what would become of them. To yearn for closure is to praise the writing. That resolution eludes the personalities who are depicted as it does us. Yet in this instance, perhaps what is most compelling is that these four individuals stand in, as in the best art, for all of us."
ARTS & CULTURE,Bruce Springsteen On Broadway? The Boss Eyes Intimate Residency,"Bruce Springsteen will reportedly swap stadiums for Broadway theaters this fall.  The Boss will bring a “pared-down version” of his energetic and massive concerts to New York City for eight weeks, likely starting in November, according to The New York Post. The 67-year-old rocker is expected to set up shop five nights per week at the Walter Kerr Theatre, which seats less 1,000 people. The theater recently housed “Amélie,” which shut down in May. Sources tell the paper that Springsteen might use the residency as a means to stage a bigger Broadway production ― like turning his 2016 memoir, Born to Run, into a musical about his life.  Now that’s something we’d like to see.  Until then, we’ll be clamoring for what will undoubtedly be a hard-to-get ticket ― one that will likely give “Hamilton” a run for its money. HuffPost has reached to Springsteen’s rep and will update this post accordingly."
ARTS & CULTURE,"E Tu, GOP?: Trump, Caesar And The American Rubicon","You hear many epitaphs spoken about the new US President: Demagogue, racist, anti-democratic... there are even comparisons to Mussolini and Hitler. But a historical nod with even more relevance would be Julius Caesar. A strong and militaristic figure emerging in a country torn by civil strife, Trump’s victory came as he opposed an establishment figure and railed against an unworkable political system. Like Caesar for the Romans 2000 years ago, Trump has for a sizable portion of Americans arrived as a welcome savior. January 10, 49 BC: Julius waited with his army on one side of the Rubicon, the boundary between Cisalpine Gaul and Italy proper. After his victories over Germanic and Celtic tribes his popularity soared. Caesar became a threat to the Senate, which called upon him to resign his command and disband his army, or risk being declared an “Enemy of the State.” Pompey, the ultimate insider, was entrusted with enforcing this edict, and the foundation for civil war was laid. Trump’s crossing from business tycoon to President was not illegal, nor did he declare himself a dictator. But like Caesar, he claimed to be a man of the people. Both managed to unite some of their fissured factions, in Trump’s case a drifting Republican party. As the Democrats clearly moved farther to the left, the Republican party was without a clear brand. So even a maverick like Trump, who many even inside the party labeled as unfit to lead the state, became the new standard bearer. Even his detractors will acknowledge that Trump is a master at branding his empire and playing to the masses. Trump campaign rallies, replete with sharp rhetoric and promises of reviving the jobs of dying US industries, became the bread and circuses of our century. Just as Trump’s new hotel opened steps from the White House and US Capitol, Caesar’s adopted son Augustus had a similar penchant for promoting the family name, putting his mark on buildings, coins and all public displays. And, as in the tumultuous times of Caesar’s post-republican Rome, many are loudly protesting the nature of Trump’s rise. After all, Trump bypassed the usual Republican chain of command through his direct appeal to the people. Many Americans, notably progressives and much of the left-leaning media still cannot comprehend “the why” of Trump’s ascension. Like the establishment senators in Rome, today’s Trump skeptics are largely insulated from average citizens and exist in the echo chambers of power. And perhaps they are less in synch with the general populace’s positive response to Trump’s vow to protect them from foreign invaders… similar to the pledges of protection that allowed Caesar to gain the people’s support as he ran roughshod over the Roman Senate. We can debate the issues of race, progressive vs conservative, and pundits’ doomsday scenarios, but what cannot be denied, and truly echoes Caesar’s Rubicon crossing, is that US voters were tired of political corruption. They were frustrated with the “Senate Class” and business as usual in their government. They were tired of not working and feeling ignored in the expanding globalist agenda. For many, Obama’s eight years of resisting embrace of national identity and perceived liberal attacks on the “Guns and God” culture, combined to create a combustible openness to a strong outsider. Between his crossing of the Rubicon in 49 BC and his assassination in 44 BC, Caesar sought to bring order back to the Republic. First he had to defeat Pompey, his Hillary. Caesar marched his army into Italy. Trump marched through the primaries, general election and now Washington politics. The question is how today’s American Rubicon narrative might end. Roman Senators, many of whom supported but didn’t trust him, ultimately betrayed Caesar in a public display featuring 27 stab wounds. Here the literal analogy of course breaks down. No one expects or wishes for a gory drama. Yet, as former critics in the Republican establishment like Ryan, McConnell and Romney have recently lined up behind the new President, the question lingers whether the establishment’s support will prove lasting. With his self-aggrandizement and penchant for insult, it seems likely that Trump’s own Republican “senate,” not to mention Democrat opposition, will turn on him. McCain and Graham are already fingering their sheaths. Will Ryan, or even Pence, prove to be Trump’s 21st-century Brutus? Will Trump’s final words in office be “E Tu, GOP”? Or might he learn from history’s lessons and deliver on his reputation as a negotiator to work with the establishment, and prove untrue the general suspicions of his lean toward authoritarianism. Or avoid the 25th amendment as the “knife” that today’s GOP can wield to take down the perceived threat. If so, he can survive – and perhaps even make his Rome great again."
ARTS & CULTURE,The Street Art Hiding On The 69th Floor Of The World Trade Center,"Is street art still street art if it dwells not on storefronts and avenues but 69 floors up in a Manhattan skyscraper? This is the question at the root of “ART4WTC: Gallery in the Sky,” an artistic collaboration between street art legends in the unlikely setting of 4 World Trade Center.  Ron English, Jenna Morello, Lauren YS, Stickymonger and Kimyon333 are among the artists contributing to the project, which collapses the space between renegade, guerrilla artwork and corporate design.  “What I find so entertaining is this contradiction of terms on all levels,” creative producer Robert Marcucci said in a statement. “And the fact that it is nestled in this very corporate structure gives it the attention I think it deserves ― a proper look at a contemporary art movement born out of a extremely stressed fabric of modern society, that is evolving more and more each day, blending various styles of art and sending a message out to larger audiences.” Marcucci explained that the recruited artists had free rein to create whatever they so pleased in the space of the open 69th floor, though they were encouraged to seek inspiration from New York City, as well as the memory of 9/11 and ideas of rebirth, strength and patriotism.  The project, dubbed an “art world in the sky,” captures the strange juxtaposition of corporate wealth and street energy that is unique to New York City. See some of the work below.  CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article’s headline misidentified the building as One World Trade Center."
ARTS & CULTURE,Dobby The House-Elf Still Brings Generosity To The 'Harry Potter' Universe And Beyond,"Dobby’s fellow house-elves never respected him. All that liberation talk was shameful ― a disgrace to the name of inherited servitude. He could have been a throwaway character in the “Harry Potter” universe, there to simply muck up Harry’s second year at Hogwarts before sinking into the scenery. But his intentions were too noble. When he wasn’t thumping his head against a wall in melodramatic self-discipline, Dobby became an iconoclast, a civil-rights advocate, a freedom fighter and the most loyal pal any witch, wizard or Muggle could envision.  In honor of the first “Harry Potter” novel’s 20th anniversary, I am here to extol the virtues of Dobby, that squat critter who, in J.K. Rowling’s words, bears “large, bat-like ears and bulging green eyes the size of tennis balls.” He is my favorite. Dobby embodies an altruism not enough humans aspire to. Now, with an American president who employs bullying tactics and an internet culture that lets brutes hide behind anonymous avatars, that benevolence resonates even more than it did nearly two decades ago.  Because they don’t fight for their own rights, house-elves reflect a timeless fear: the idea that we are stuck with whatever fate dictates. But Dobby’s employment with the oppressive Malfoy clan, which comes to a blissful close when Harry’s scheme to free him works at the end of Chamber of Secrets, turns him into a resilient ideal. Being released from his harsh past bestowed in Dobby a generosity that he then showed to others. Like so many great literary figures, that generosity became his tragic flaw.  Forever amazed by Harry and company’s most basic kindnesses, Dobby did not exploit his newfound autonomy. He remained humble. In liberating the elf, Rowling made him the backbone of a key political divide: how labor is honored within the wizarding world. House-elves are low-ranking members of the proletariat, their owners slave drivers. Freed, Dobby rightly insisted he be paid for his work, a foreign concept for house-elves, penniless creatures expected to preserve unyielding loyalty toward their masters. But he wasn’t fighting for his pocketbook ― he just wanted an emblem of respect. When Dumbledore gave Dobby a gig in the Hogwarts kitchen, Dobby negotiated downward, accepting a mere portion of the salary and benefits package offered to him. He is everything we human greed machines are not: humble, dutiful, limber.  Rowling found optimal use for Dobby’s purity throughout the series. He brought Harry a bundle of Gillyweed during the Triwizard Tournamnet. When Winky imbibed too much Butterbeer, he hid her in the Room of Requirement, which he then recommended to Harry as a boardroom for the Voldemort-resistant Dumbledore’s Army. (Essentially, Voldemort’s demise can be traced to Dobby’s guidance.) When the vile Kreacher insulted Harry, Dobby pulverized him, tearfully insisting his cherished pal is a great wizard. Later, in the story’s most tragic death, Dobby Apparated to Malfoy Manor ― his former penitentiary ― to save Harry and crew from Bellatrix Lestrange, only to meet the cold quietus of her silver knife. By the time Harry escaped with Dobby in his arms, it was too late. Dobby died sputtering his two favorite words: “Harry ... Potter ...” We can also credit him for fomenting Ron and Hermione’s relationship. Moved by Dobby’s plight and death, Ron suggested evacuating the house-elves during the Battle of Hogwarts, promoting Hermione to kiss him for the first time.   For a loud-mouthed sprite whose initial appearance threatened to derail Harry’s Hogwarts trajectory, Dobby remained a champion beyond his final breath. In Harry and his comrades, he found humans who saw him as they did themselves: worthy, competent, crucial. Few of us are or have friends as lovely as Dobby, true stalwarts who look outside their own economic and emotional sorrows in the name of others’ prosperity. We need more of that right now. I sobbed a pond of tears when my beloved little chum perished. While re-reading his death scene in “Deathly Hallows” last week, I teared up again. Harry’s mutual loyalty runs deep and rich, years after he wanted nothing more than for those tennis-ball eyes and bat-like ears to get the hell away from Privet Drive. It’s a buddy tale for the ages.  Here lies Dobby, a free elf and a fantastic character.  From June 1 to 30, HuffPost is celebrating the 20th anniversary of the very first “Harry Potter” book by reminiscing about all things Hogwarts. Accio childhood memories."
ARTS & CULTURE,"After 46 Years, Yoko Ono Is Finally Credited For Co-Writing 'Imagine'","After 46 years, Yoko Ono is finally receiving the credit she deserves. The iconic multidisciplinary artist was officially credited as a co-writer of the 1971 song “Imagine,” currently attributed to Ono’s deceased husband, John Lennon.  The news was announced Wednesday at a meeting of the National Music Publishers Association by its CEO, David Israelite. He also bestowed “Imagine” with the Centennial Song award.  “While things may have been different in 1971, today I am glad to say things have changed,” Israelite said. “So tonight it is my distinct honor to correct the record some 48 years later and recognize Yoko Ono as a co-writer of the NMPA centennial song ‘Imagine,’ and to present Yoko Ono with this well-deserved credit.” A post shared by Sean Ono Lennon (@sean_ono_lennon) on Jun 14, 2017 at 4:44pm PDT He then played an archival interview, in which Lennon explains that the song would not exist without Ono. “[Imagine] should be credited as a Lennon-Ono song,” he said. “Because a lot of it — the lyric and the concept — came from Yoko. But those days I was a bit more selfish, a bit more macho, and I sort of omitted to mention her contribution. But it was right out of Grapefruit, her book. There’s a whole pile of pieces about ‘imagine this’ and ‘imagine that.’” Seven years before “Imagine,” Ono self-published Grapefruit, a little gem of a book, unruly and quiet at once, filled with strange wishes and demands. “Imagine your body spreading rapidly all over the world like thin tissue,” one line reads. “Imagine cutting out one part of the tissue.”  Sean Lennon accompanied his mother, Ono, who uses a wheelchair, onstage to accept the Centennial Song award. According to Lennon, the artist welled up with tears upon hearing the announcement. Onstage, Ono said her waning health has heightened her appreciation of the song and imbued her with a magnified esteem for being alive, Variety reported. “This is the best time of my life,” she said, to applause. Congratulations, Yoko. It’s about time. "
ARTS & CULTURE,How Arts And Culture Make New York A Place For All Of Us,"By Michele Kumi Baer Ask any New Yorker what makes this city a great place to live, and you will get an earful about the rich cultural life. From world-famous productions on proscenium stages to longstanding drumming circles in City parks, New York is home to an unparalleled variety of artistic activities that give New Yorkers a sense of belonging amid a dense, impersonal urban enclave; provide space for people to engage in civic action; and celebrate the beauty and ingenuity that exists within all of us.  A city like ours doesn’t happen overnight. It is the result of centuries of migrations, policies, protests, and practices of people that value culture, heritage, and expression.  Over the next year, we have the opportunity to continue this legacy and sustain New York as a global cultural capital. As the City completes its cultural plan, a blueprint for cultural policy in the years to come, the federal government renews efforts to cut funding for the arts and basic social services.  We need a cultural plan that advances artistic practices and cultural institutions that serve New Yorkers who will be the most affected by proposed federal cuts, or we risk losing the diversity that makes New York City a cultural hub.  The concept of creative “placemaking” – that arts and culture help develop a place and its community – is not a new idea. At The New York Community Trust, we recently brought some of our donors together to learn about this phenomenon. Since 2010, an organized national creative placemaking field has emerged, shepherded by the team at ArtPlace America. Increased attention to this work has sparked more investments at the nexus of arts and community development. We’ve seen it through philanthropic partnerships like ArtPlace, a funding collaborative that positions culture as a core sector for community planning and development, and newer endeavors like Upstart Co-Lab, which connects artist-innovators doing place-based work with impact investors who want to support it.  Policymakers also have taken note. In recent years, more municipalities have enacted cultural policy initiatives aimed at harnessing the power of the arts to increase wellness and social cohesion in their cities. A recent study funded by The Trust identified several neighborhoods for strategic investment, including so-called “civic clusters,” lower-income neighborhoods with a density of cultural assets that exceeds that of other neighborhoods with similar economics (e.g., Bedford-Stuyvesant, Flushing, Hunts Point), and lower-income neighborhoods that have fewer cultural assets than their peers (e.g., Corona, East New York, South Jamaica). Many lower-income neighborhoods house community development corporations (CDCs), which have been creatively supporting their communities since the Bedford Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation became the nation’s first CDC in 1967.  Recently the Greater Jamaica Development Corporation (GJDC) has been working with the City Department of Cultural Affairs’ Building Community Capacity (BCC) initiative (also funded by The Trust) to advance equitable development in Downtown Jamaica that is inclusive of culture, and it is exploring the development of a new artist housing development in the neighborhood. CDCs are well-positioned to help ensure local artists and cultural groups have a say in the future of their neighborhoods.  The City has put forward a proposal for its cultural plan (due out in July) to provide baselined funding for the Building Community Capacity initiative in the City’s budget, and therefore remove reliance on a now at-risk federal Community Development Block Grant program for this effort to survive.  New York is a dynamic, creative place because of the plurality of cultural resources it houses in every borough. Artists are the problem solvers, truth tellers, community builders, and spiritual guides of our society. Our cultural traditions give us a sense of belonging, help us connect to our neighbors, and allow us to explore human ingenuity. Social, spiritual, economic, and health benefits are associated with culture, and recent research has the data to prove it.  The challenge for philanthropy and the City’s cultural plan is to ensure that our arts investments keep New York a creative place for all of us. Michele Kumi Baer is a program associate for The Trust’s grantmaking to promote thriving communities."

HuffPost has an exclusive clip from Mock’s Surpassing Certainty audio book, in which she recounts her experiences as a night-club dancer. “It went way deeper than mere sexuality,” she reads. “Your duty was to be amiable, available and flirtatious. ... You were selling a girlfriend experience.”  Surpassing Certainty is now available."
ARTS & CULTURE,Tracy K. Smith Is America's New Poet Laureate,"Tracy K. Smith, Pulitzer Prize winner and professor of creative writing, is the next poet laureate of the United States.  Carla Hayden, the standing Librarian of Congress, announced Wednesday that she has appointed Smith as the nation’s next poet. Smith will be taking the reins from Juan Felipe Herrera, who was appointed poet laureate twice in 2015 and 2016. Smith, 45, received the Pulitzer Prize in 2012 for her collection of poetry titled Life on Mars, which “sends us out into the magnificent chill of the imagination and then returns us to ourselves, both changed and consoled,” according to a 2011 New York Times book review. Smith authored two more books of poetry ― The Body’s Question (2003) and Duende (2007) ― and a memoir, Ordinary Light, which earned her the honor of National Book Award finalist for nonfiction in 2015. Pulitzer Prize winner Tracy K. Smith will be the new U.S. #poetlaureate, @librarycongress will announce today.  https://t.co/hvb6yJIJNL pic.twitter.com/0oTVFLhm8y Every year, the Librarian of Congress appoints one “poet laureate consultant in poetry” to serve the Library of Congress. The library’s description for the role is purposefully vague, so the poet laureate has the freedom bring to the official position whatever they desire. The only steadfast requirement is that the laureate serves as “the nation’s official lightning rod for the poetic impulse of Americans,” according to the national library. In return, the poet laureate receives a $35,000 annual stipend, and $5,000 travel budget. Smith told NPR that her responsibility as the nation’s poet is to “raise awareness of poetry and its value in our culture” and to bring it to those who are not yet familiar with the art form. “To me that means talking to people — getting off the usual path of literary festivals and university reading series and talking to people who might not even yet be readers of poetry,” she told NPR. “I would love to go to places where people might be struggling, where people might wonder if there are voices out there for them,” she added. ""I pray you are what waits/ to break back into the world"" - Tracy K. Smith pic.twitter.com/xBu6hC96zM Smith was born in Massachusetts and is the youngest of five siblings, according to NPR. She attended Harvard University for her Bachelors and received her Masters of Fine Arts in creative writing from Columbia University. Smith was a Stegner fellow at Stanford University from 1997 to 1999 and, in 2014, she was awarded with a fellowship with the Academy of American Poets. She currently teaches at Princeton University and, according to NPR, she is working on another form of literature: opera.  Hayden paid tribute to Smith’s poetry work for traveling the world and taking on its voices. It “brings history and memory to life; calls on the power of literature as well as science, religion, and pop culture,”the current Librarian of Congress said. “With directness and deftness, she contends with the heavens or plumbs our inner depths ― all to better understand what makes us human,” she added. Smith sees value in sharing poetry with the country especially in today’s tense political climate. “Poetry can help us make sense of the contemporary moment,” she told The Washington Post.  “I’m excited by the fact that what poets are writing speaks to a particular moment and it speaks to the ages. Any political moment is uncertain, and a voice that lets us think about that will last,” Smith continued. “Let’s think about how empathy can drive our perspective of one another. Let’s think about how we can get past what’s binary and simplest to what’s complicated.” Smith is due to begin her term as the poet laureate in September. “Wade in the Water,” her fourth book of poetry, is due in stores in April."
ARTS & CULTURE,The Revolutionary Street Art Project That Inspired Banksy And Empowered A City's Youth,"John Nation just wanted to give teenagers in Bristol, southwest England, a safe place to spray-paint without fear of arrest and prosecution. Little did the then 21-year-old youth worker know back in 1984 that his “Aerosol Art Project” at the Barton Hill Youth Center would go some way to shaping British and global street art over the coming years and decades. It spawned an entire generation of influential and genre-defining artists ― including Banksy. But as Nation, now 54, told HuffPost in a wide-ranging interview, the initiative also almost ended up costing him his job, his reputation and his liberty. Nation was just 18-years-old when, in 1981, he became an outreach worker at the youth center in his home neighborhood of Barton Hill. “We helped kids deal with the nitty gritty of life [...] providing sexual health awareness, talking about drugs, that kind of thing,” he told HuffPost. A trip to Amsterdam in 1982 sparked an interest in graffiti, which he saw adorning the Dutch capital’s streets. “I started reading whatever material I could.” Coincidentally, some of the 14 to 19-year-olds attending the center were also becoming interested in the art form. Inspired by movies such as “Wild Style” and “Beat Street” and the painting of Bristol’s earliest-recognized graffiti artist 3D (a.k.a. Robert Del Naja from Massive Attack), Nation said they’d spend hours copying outlines of the work featured in the seminal book “Subway Art.” When one teen returned from New York City with photographs of the graffiti he’d seen, Nation allowed the teen and his friends to paint the club’s front wall. “Barton Hill was rough,” Nation said. “At that time the club was very territorial, seen as right wing, predominantly white and very hostile to outsiders.” Its exterior walls, he said, were mainly daubed with anti-authority slogans such as “No Police State in Barton Hill” or ones promoting the far-right movement, the National Front. “These guys produced a piece that was so vibrant,” Nation said. “It helped break down some barriers. Lots of these guys listened to hip hop, reggae and black-inspired music. Lots of the artists they looked up to were black, hispanic and Puerto Rican, but they were in a predominantly white area. Being involved in graffiti opened their eyes and helped to lower their prejudices.” Inspired by what the teens had produced, Nation sought permission from his employers at the now-defunct Avon County Council authority to set up the “Barton Hill Aerosol Art Project” — a place he envisioned would let the youngsters, some of whom were only a bit younger than him, to “express themselves freely and legally” on the center’s walls instead of tagging or painting unauthorized spots on public or private property which could lead to their arrest. Cheo and Inkie were among the first generation of budding street artists to attend the center, which had the added appeal of being the only one in the city with an indoor skate ramp. Before long, the artists covered most of the building with their work. “Once word got out that it was a safe environment to paint and look at books and photographs and watch films about graffiti, then people from across the city started coming,” Nation said. “Once you had that one group of people give it their seal of approval, others saw it was safe and followed suit.” At its peak, more than 40 youngsters regularly attended the project. Graffiti writers from across the U.K. also visited, and it inspired other authorities from around the country to launch similar initiatives.  “It was a great atmosphere, very expressive, very creative,” Nation added. “There was never any bad vibes or competition, none of that element. It was all about being a crew and a togetherness and I still think that’s true to all the guys who still know each other and paint now.” Not everyone was in favor of the project, however. Unbeknownst to Nation, from 1988 to 1989 the British Transport Police surveilled the center and several of its artists as part of a city-wide investigation into graffiti tagging and criminal behavior. John Nation Operation Anderson sought to profile graffiti artists suspected of criminal damage and culminated with a series of raids on properties across the region. Police arrested dozens of people, including Nation. Officers searched his home and the center. “Bearing in mind that I was running an aerosol art project, there was no way there wasn’t going to be any material at the center,” he said. “It was like an Aladdin’s Cave for them.” Police seized a “massive stash of paint” Nation had procured from the project’s sponsors and his treasured 5,000-plus snaps of graffiti he’d either taken himself or been sent by writers from around the world.  Nation believes police thought the club was “some kind of ‘Axis of Evil’ that was the main meeting point for all of Bristol’s illegal graffiti writers and a place where other writers from across the country would come.”  “It wasn’t that at all though,” he said, although he acknowledges some of the artists were painting on unauthorized spots on their own.  As was revealed in the BBC documentary “Drawing The Line,” (above), police matched tags on the artwork in the club to tags on illegal works across the city.  They charged several artists with criminal damage. Nation himself was charged with suspicion of conspiracy to incite individuals to commit criminal damage.  “Their main case against me was that the photos and books I had, if shown to a young person of impressional age, would incite them to go out and commit criminal damage,” Nation said. “They also said I was covering up for the young people and I was duty bound to divulge information on them. But I didn’t assist them whatsoever. I answered ‘no comment’ to pretty much everything.” Several artists were found guilty of criminal damage and received fines. Nation’s charge, however, was dropped on the day his trial was due to begin after prosecutors offered no evidence of incitement.  A post shared by John Nation (@johnnation) on Jun 1, 2017 at 8:53am PDT Nation says he then consciously used the subsequent press coverage to promote his project’s work and to argue that without a place to legally paint, “the illegal culture of the art form just gets reinforced.” Following the police raids, Nation says many of those involved in the city’s street art scene went “underground for a while.” “It was like they were regrouping,” he said. “Many of the guys arrested took a break, lessened their illegal activities, and some decided painting legally was the only way.” Nation says the publicity did inspire, however, a new generation of artists to begin visiting the project ― with one of them being Banksy. “As a young boy, he’d come to the center and watch people paint. He was heavily into hip hop culture, graffiti, and Barton Hill was where it was happening. Every weekend there was fresh work going up on the walls and people would exchange ideas,” Nation said.  “He says he called it his religious pilgrimage every weekend to go. Many of these guys had their own crazy, little dreams and he said what Barton Hill showed him was very powerful, that you could go on to follow those dreams.” At that time, Nation says Banksy (who despite multiple attempts and theories has never been officially identified), wasn’t producing the political or social commentary pieces that he’s since become globally famous for.  As part of a crew with some slightly older teens, Nation says he was “into graffiti and letterforms and writing.” He also didn’t stand out “as one of the graffiti writers you’d call a ‘top boy,’” nor was he using his “Banksy” moniker either, says Nation. “The Banksy thing came later.” Nation claims Banksy is “without doubt” the biggest contemporary artist in the world right now, but admits he didn’t foresee his rise to prominence during his early days of painting at the center. Instead, he believes Banksy truly began to make his mark when he changed his style and began using stencils. “Not only could he paint quicker, he could paint more locations and produce more work. He started off with quite crude stencil work, like the rats, then he started progressing to more clean work, more sharper,” Nation said. “These smaller stencils started appearing across the city and for me, it’s once he made that conscious decision to change the style of what he was painting and the content of what he was painting when he exploded,” he added. Banksy himself admits in his book “Wall and Piece” that his switch in style came when aged 18 transport police chased him through a thorny bush after spotting him painting “LATE AGAIN” on the side of a train. “The rest of my mates made it to the car and disappeared so I spent over an hour hidden under a dumper truck with engine oil leaking all over me,” he wrote. “As I lay there listening to the cops on the tracks I realized I had to cut my painting time in half or give up altogether. I was staring straight up at the stenciled plate on the bottom of a fuel tank when I realized I could just copy that style and make each letter three feet high.” Nation said that change led Banksy to “strike an accord with first and foremost the Bristol public, and then the British public.” “Lots of people who wouldn’t be into street art could relate to the simplicity and the fun and the characters he was painting. As he’s become more mature, the images and message have become more hard-hitting — he’s a clever guy.”  A post shared by Banksy (@banksy) on May 7, 2017 at 6:40am PDT Nation does question how Banksy creates some of his works, such as the “Brexit” piece (above) that he unveiled in Dover, southeast England, in May as a commentary on the U.K.’s referendum vote to leave the European Union. “Yes he painted it, but he’s got to have a team of people that set up the scaffold and he must have approached the people who own the property before that,” Nation said. “You can’t just rock up and set up a scaffold on the side of someone’s property without there being no questions asked. It’s a huge wall. It’s massive.” With so much history between Nation and Banksy, one may assume the pair remain close and in touch. When faced with the suggestion, however, Nation responded with a stony silence before changing the subject. While the legacy of the Barton Hill Youth Center often focuses on Banksy, many of the center’s other alum have also gone on to enjoy hugely successful careers. Jody Thomas, who in April gave HuffPost a helping hand in unveiling its new logo (below), has painted and exhibited his signature photo-realistic style around the world: But for him, it also all began at the center, which he first attended when he was just 15 years old after being encouraged by a school friend who’d described Nation to him as “outspoken, politically militant and not one to suffer fools.”  “It felt like I was being led to meet the leader of a despotic cult,” Thomas told HuffPost, adding that Nation “didn’t disappoint” when he finally met him.  “He immediately went through my school folder of work based around the comic art of 2,000 A.D. and classical painting and drawings,” he said. “I think he saw in me the opportunity to add a different artistic dimension to the club’s repertoire and left me to recreate on the walls of the club what I had on paper.” Jody Thomas Thomas credits Nation as being at “the forefront” of the street art movement at that time. “His energy and personality has garnered him an amount of respect amongst Bristolians on the level of any rock star or public figure,” he said. “For me, he is the ‘Darwin’ of street art in the U.K. and gave me a opportunity to express the art that spoke to me all those years ago.” The admiration is mutual. Nation still remembers the day that Thomas first brought in his work which was “totally different” to what was being produced in the club at the time. “I thought to myself, ‘fucking hell, this is amazing. He’s 15 and painting like this?’ I thought, ‘this boy is going to go far,’” Nation said. “At first he wasn’t accepted as much by the graffiti lads. Jody was into indie music and a lot of that music had dark imagery on its album sleeves,” he added. “He embraced that kind of artwork. He painted small pieces, then he painted these two black and white heads (below) and that was it. I have a lot of time for him. He didn’t stick to what everyone else was doing. He just wanted to be an artist and express his talents.” Inkie, a.k.a. Tom Bingle, also emerged from the center. He’s since worked as a head of design at SEGA and hosted his own shows across the globe. Recently, he painted alongside Shepard Fairey, the artist behind the “Hope” poster that came to define former President Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign. For Inkie, Nation’s project acted as a vital “central hub” for the city’s graffiti artists in the pre-internet era of the late ‘80s to mid-90s. “Without this center and John’s support of our artwork, Bristol would not have had the scene it maintains today,” he told HuffPost. By 1991, however, Nation had become disillusioned with the restraints he felt the authority was putting on him and quit. “I was seen as being quite outspoken, left wing and a bit of a socialist,” he said. “But I’m proud of what I did back then. And the fact that people still talk about then and what I achieved for me is justification for what I did do.” Nation went on to forge a successful career in promoting dance music events across the U.K. and the NASS action sports and music show in Somerset.  With the explosion in the popularity of street art, which he puts principally down to the rise of the internet and social media, he’s since come full circle ― and now gives regular tours of Bristol’s scene via the WhereTheWall tour. “People from all over the world come, and no one tour is the same. Street art is here today, gone tomorrow. The art form is transient,” he said. In April, Nation curated his first ever solo show, “Graffiti Nation,” at Bristol’s Upfest gallery, the home of Europe’s largest live street art festival. He also worked with Inkie on the “See No Evil” art exhibition in 2011 and 2012, and remains a fierce advocate for spaces where artists can legally paint. He’s also set to feature in another BBC documentary, which will analyze the U.K. street art scene in the decades since Operation Anderson. Nation’s pedigree, knowledge and influence of street art and the genres that umbrella term encompasses have seen him nicknamed the “Godfather” of the Bristol (and increasingly British) scene. But it’s a label that doesn’t sit well with him. “I look back and I feel that all those years ago I was vilified and I could have possibly lost my job,” he said. “Then two years ago I’m being used as the face of Bristol tourism as someone who represents it as a progressive, cultural city. Who would have thought it?” “I get called the ‘Godfather,’ but I’m not. I just had a faith and a belief in these young people when no one else would give them the time of day,” he added. “I’m just lucky enough that i’ve been involved in the graffiti scene and seen it emerge. Bristol is not what it is because of me, far from it. I’m just one cog in the wheel, just like Banksy and all the others.” Check out John Nation’s Instagram, Facebook and the tour website for WhereTheWall."
ARTS & CULTURE,Much Ado...,"Shakespeare in the Park’s production of “Julius Caesar” with the man himself looking uncannily like Donald Trump has caused a stir. So much so in fact that some of the corporate sponsors have decided to withdraw financial support. These include Bank of America and Delta Airlines with the latter stating “No matter what your political stance may be, the graphic staging of ‘Julius Caesar’ does not reflect Delta’s values.” I wonder what on earth this means. So let’s dig a little further into why a play written more than 400 years ago could create such a reaction. To begin with, Shakespeare can rightly be called the most contemporary of all playwrights. His characters describe psychological types and states of mind that even Freud thought were extraordinary. His plays can be staged in any number of ways from period costumes to modern dress, from demure Elizabethan backdrop to the Fascist brutalism of the1930s. His ideas are so vast and his understanding of our humanness so all consuming that his plays can fit any age and any approach. Somehow he always provides the opportunity for the essence of his drama to survive and shine no matter how radical the treatment. He was a careful politician in his time when a careless word or action could lead to terrible reprisals. His only slip was a re-staging of “Richard II” specially requested by the Earl of Essex, Queen Elizabeth’s erstwhile favorite who was about to fall from power and end up on the block. “Richard II” is about a sovereign who looses his crown and staging it at a time of possible national insurrection by Essex was an unwise move. Then there is Shakespeare’s political handling of the character of Julius Caesar. This had nothing to do with government but with management of his actors. Why is the play called “Julius Caesar” when our eponymous hero has only five percent of the lines and is killed in Act 3, Scene 1? Compare this to Brutus at 28 percent of the lines, Cassius 20 percent and Mark Antony 13 percent. Shakespeare had a dilemma with this play. He had written three great parts, parts that actors everywhere still fight over from Orson Welles and Marlon Brando to Ralph Fiennes and Kenneth Branagh. He could easily have called the play “Brutus” or even “Mark Antony” but if he had, the fall-out from his star actors would have meant company internecine warfare. So the compromise was to call it “Julius Caesar” to whom he gives some of the best one-liners of all time: He obviously revered Caesar and made him a sympathetic character following his historic source material in Plutarch, even down to showing that he had lost his hearing in one ear. Portraying Caesar as Trump is probably well within contemporary performance practice, but maybe a little cheap and obvious. It’s certainly not something to get fired up about. We live in an open society; there is the First Amendment, which applies as well to theatre directors and we are mature experienced adults who can deal with the slings and arrows of outrageous stage performances. Well, can’t we? If you are intent on getting offended, then watch Bill Maher or John Oliver on HBO delivering their own style of political commentary. (I believe that such commentary is really important in a free society.) If you really wanted to create a sensation with a Trumpian figure in Shakespearean form then you could conceive of a new “Macbeth” with King Duncan recast as Hillary, or better still a white Othello surrounded by an all black cast with those blonde curls taking us from victorious battles (signifying the election perhaps) to the murderous bedchamber scene about which we can only imagine. Now that might be really nicely provocative and stir up some really great discussion and debate. But getting upset about a small character in a big play looking like the President, well really, get over it and get some courage because we are going to need it for the next few years. In keeping with that thought, I offer some lines inspired by but not written by Shakespeare—the result of a Shakespearean improvisation competition between my son and me. (He won.)"
ARTS & CULTURE,Uproar Over Trumped-Up 'Julius Caesar' Ignores The Play's Actual Meaning,"A 400-year-old play by an underground playwright named William Shakespeare is making headlines this week after The Public Theater’s recent production of “Julius Caesar” angered some viewers (and hence corporate sponsors) by portraying the Roman ruler with a curious likeness to President Donald Trump. Spoiler alert: The Trump-Caesar resemblance is causing tension because, as any Shakespeare or “Mean Girls” devotee knows, Caesar is assassinated in the course of the play. Or, as Fox & Friends reported, “President Trump [is] brutally stabbed to death by women and minorities.”  Of course, Shakespeare did not pen his bloody death sequence with Trump in mind. Nevertheless, artistic director Oskar Eustis’ decision to stage the killing of a mercurial, blonde-haired ruler in an ill-fitting suit and too-long red tie has drawn criticism from some viewers, various right-wing media outlets and Donald Trump Jr. I wonder how much of this ""art"" is funded by taxpayers? Serious question, when does ""art"" become political speech & does that change things? https://t.co/JfOmLLBJCn Delta Airlines and Bank of America responded to the firestorm by withdrawing financial support from the production, which is currently running at Central Park’s Delacorte Theater as part of New York’s famed Shakespeare in the Park festival. Delta released a statement condemning the performance’s “graphic staging,” describing the show’s artistic and creative direction as having “crossed the line on the standards of good taste.” A spokeswoman for Bank of America similarly lamented that “The Public Theater chose to present ‘Julius Caesar’ in a way that was intended to provoke and offend.” American Express also tweeted that the company does not “condone the interpretation of the Julius Caesar play” despite its continued sponsorship of The Public Theater’s other endeavors. As corporations severed ties to the show, theater buffs and high school English honors students were quick to call out the absurdity of the denunciations ― not only because of a little thing called freedom of speech, but because many don’t quite seem to recall what the whole message of “Julius Caesar” actually is.  THE ENTIRE GODDAMN PLAY IS ABOUT ASSASSINATION BEING A TOTAL DISASTER! THE PATH TO RUIN!!! Read a book for the love of God. Yes, Eustis’ production of “Julius Caesar” features, in no subtle terms, a Trumpian ruler being stabbed to death by senators, ostensibly, for the good of their nation. But the remainder of the play hashes out how this decision to off a tyrannical ruler in such an undemocratic manner yields nothing but disaster.  As New York Times’ Jesse Green wrote in his review of the show: “Even a cursory reading of the play, the kind that many American teenagers give it in high school, is enough to show that it does not advocate assassination. Shakespeare portrays the killing of Caesar by seven of his fellow senators as an unmitigated disaster for Rome, no matter how patriotic the intentions.” For those whose memories have faded a bit since 11th grade, a brief refresher: “Julius Caesar” tells the tale of a demagogue ruling the Roman republic in 44 B.C. A conspiracy grows against the ruler, a man senators feel has grown tyrannical and threatens the future of the nation. In the famed Act 3, Scene 1, Caesar is killed by his fellow statesmen under the guise of patriotism.  Yet the decision to kill Caesar ends up shattering Rome’s democracy, rather than saving it. The play, then, warns viewers against violent reactions to despotic rule. As Eustis wrote in a note regarding the show: “’Julius Caesar’ can be read as a warning parable to those who try to fight for democracy by undemocratic means. To fight the tyrant does not mean imitating him.” To suggest the production advocates for or excuses violence in any way is just false. If anything, the play suggests the very opposite, advising against the power-hungriness both Caesar and his opponents embody. If the advice is not heeded, as Gregg Henry, the actor playing Caesar at The Public, warned cheekily in an interview with Backstage: “You can end up losing democracy for like, 2,000 years.” For some viewers, however, the message of Shakespeare’s words has faded into the background, overshadowed by the visceral power of a Trump-like actor’s white shirt stained with fake blood making its rounds across social media. One named Laura Shaeffer expressed her disgust in an interview with Mediaite. “To be honest I thought it was shocking and distasteful,” she said. “If this had happened to any other president — even as recently as Barack Obama or George W. Bush — it would not have flown. People would have been horrified.” Fair enough, except past productions have featured Caesar in the guise of both presidents listed above, among others. Presidents portrayed as Julius Caesar in U.S. productions: Lincoln, Reagan, Clinton, GWB, Obama, Trump. (Caesar died in all of them.) In a 2013 review of “Julius Caesar” at Minneapolis St. Paul’s Guthrie Theater, a critic for Mpls St Paul Magazine described the value of casting Caesar as a “tall, lanky black man,” despite the resemblance being “too obvious.” “Like Caesar, Obama rose to power on a tide of public goodwill,” the piece reads, “like Caesar, there were many in government who doubted Obama’s leadership abilities; and now that Obama’s first term has failed to live up to the messianic hype, there are plenty of people who — for the good of the country, you understand, not their own glory — want to take Obama down.” So, this whole cast-a-Shakespearian-tale-in-modern-day-light thing is nothing new. It’s actually, a centuries-old practice. And Trump isn’t being forced to endure anything to which previous American presidents haven’t already been subjected. For eons, political leaders have been accused of greed, egotism and a lust for power. Democracy, as a result, can feel fragile ― if not under siege. Art exists in times like these to illuminate the patterns between past and present while untangling the particulars that distinguish each. It can stir provocation, yes, but also reflection, dissent and enlightenment.  The theater is often viewed as a space for pushing boundaries and critical thinking. In this production, despite the bloodshed onstage, no real person leaves wounded or endangered; audiences are not encouraged to wreck havoc on any American politician. (In fact, quite the opposite.) To suggest the staging of one of the most esteemed dramas of all time is “political speech” targeted directly and uniquely at Trump not only ignores the play’s message, but its history, too.   As one seemingly incredulous viewer said in a video interview with Inside Edition: “It’s not really the president, it’s theater. Everyone knows it’s theater.”  Have plans to see ""Julius Caesar"" (Shakespeare-in-the-Park)  in thrilled defiance of ignorant would-be censors  (Faux News, Delta airlines). Julius Caesar is slated to run at Central Park’s Delacorte Theater until June 18 as part of New York’s Shakespeare in the Park festival. Tickets are free. Welcome to Battleground, where art and activism meet."
ARTS & CULTURE,The 'President Of The United States' Made An Appearance At The Tonys,"Damned if Kevin Spacey was going to get through the 2017 Tony Awards without slipping into his “House of Cards” character at least once.  When “Hamilton” creator Lin-Manuel Miranda took the stage to announce the year’s Best Musical, he appeared purposefully envelope-less, forced to request one over the microphone before he could anoint the ceremony’s final winner. “Ladies and gentlemen, the president of the United States,” an announcer bellowed, momentarily turning a few heads looking to see who’d be delivering the paper Miranda needed. “Francis J. Underwood,” the voice said, introducing Spacey as Frank Underwood, who paraded toward Miranda, with Claire (Robin Wright) and Doug Stamper (Michael Kelly) in tow, to the tune of “Hail to the Chief.” Claire, wearing a familiar military-style dress, stood silent as Frank shook the hand “of the man who created ‘Hamilton,’ the musical that does our nation proud.” The fake president handed over the envelope before pulling his signature fourth-wall-breaking gaze. “Claire, let’s leave them to allow them to finish up with their award show,” he said. “I want to get the hell out of here before Bette Midler thanks anyone else,” he chirped directly into the camera. Maybe this was the Tonys’ attempt to avoid an envelope debacle like that of the Oscars. Or maybe it was Spacey’s last attempt to remind audiences to watch “House of Cards” ― its fifth season is streaming on Netflix now. Either way, the Tony Awards didn’t miss their moment to promote “the shot America deserves,” quickly tweeting out an Underwood-Miranda 2020 campaign sticker. Don’t throw it away. @FrankUnderwocd @Lin_Manuel #TonyAwards2017 #UnderwoodMiranda2020 pic.twitter.com/d7QYI5rqiv Upon receiving the envelope, Miranda announced that “Dear Evan Hansen” had nabbed the awards show’s concluding statuette, putting a cap on a long night filled with Spacey’s impersonations, Colbert’s Trump jokes, Mark Hamil’s Carrie Fisher tribute and an appearance by Dr. Jill Biden.

ARTS & CULTURE,5 Unexpected Things We Learned On The 'Harry Potter' Studio Tour,"You can go to London without visiting the Warner Bros. studio, where cast and crew brought J.K. Rowling’s expansive magical world to the screen. But if you’re a “Harry Potter” fan, you really shouldn’t. HuffPost had the pleasure of touring the corners of Hogwarts and beyond that have been carefully set up for fans to lovingly gaze at, obsessively photograph, and even consume ― the Butterbeer is delicious ― in Leavesden, England. Awash in “Harry Potter” nostalgia, we walked through the Great Hall, where professors McGonagall and Snape stand at attention on either side of Dumbledore. We peered into the surprisingly compact Gryffindor common room and brushed by the magnificent Fat Lady, sans password. We saw Harry’s Hogwarts acceptance letters strung up to cloud the Dursleys’ living room with a flurry of paper whizzing motionless out of the fireplace. We nipped into the Hogwarts Express, where cars representing Harry, Ron and Hermione’s many years of rides are littered with candy wrappers, books and copies of the Quibbler. We admired a wall of newspapers, envelopes, cereal boxes and every other array of printed prop, all blessed with the wizarding world’s unique typography that screams in block letters at one turn and appears calmly serifed at another. We passed the Knight Bus and the infamously well-manicured Privet Drive. We forgot our Put-Outer, so the street remained illuminated.  In a new section of the studio, we witnessed the Whomping Willow in destructive action and strolled along a trail through a forest full of meticulously handcrafted trees that obscure one special hippogriff and too many arachnids. And that’s not even half of all we saw. Among the many bits and bobs along the way, we picked up some trivia on the “Harry Potter” film series. Our list doesn’t give away everything to be discovered on a visit, and certainly can’t replicate the whimsical wizarding atmosphere culled from the thoughtful work of prop developers and costumers over 10 years of filming. Nevertheless, we’ve shared a few pieces of knowledge below.  Although the depth and breadth of Rowling’s wizarding world could surely have produced enough famous magical faces to fill the halls of Hogwarts ― the set included nearly 350 enchanted portraits ― producers allowed many of the film’s crew to pose for portraits to fill in the gaps. On view, for the sharp-sighted, are Barry Wilkinson the prop master, David Heyman the producer and Stuart Craig the production designer, among others. All look as if they know just the precise way to inflect “leviosa.” Her dark hair is greying, and she displays a very prim expression, gazing slightly down her nose at the painter, but the witch pictured bears only a slight resemblance to Dame Maggie Smith. Or the witch described in the book, with her affinity for emerald green and tartan robes; this McGonagall is in blue, with a gold pendant around her neck. (Yes, you’ll have to make a visit to see her.) Professor Snape is a closet fan of muggle zoos, it seems. Among the more than 500 of bottles stashed along the walls of the dungeon classroom, some with handwritten labels, are plastic animals from the shop at the zoo in London’s Regent’s Park. That’s a significantly cuter way to illustrate pickled animals, like the ones the dungeon is meant to house, than some of the other things in those jars ― namely, baked animal bones from a nearby butcher.  Well, not trashed, exactly ― you can see them displayed on the tour. The dusty glass orbs were created to illustrate the Ministry of Magic’s luminescent Hall of Prophecy that contained records of foretold events, including the prophecy made by Professor Trelawney about a child with the power to defeat Voldemort. The props weren’t used in the film, though, because Yates ― who directed “The Order of the Phoenix,” “The Half-Blood Prince” and both “Deathly Hallows” installments ― decided to use CGI to create them. They might’ve been destroyed anyway in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, but imagine being those prop designers. One of the more eerie behind-the-scenes revelations is seeing the bodiless head of Hagrid ― complete with artful wrinkles, rosy veins and individual eyebrow hairs ― that the prop department made for tall stunt doubles portraying him in action scenes and wide shots. Filmmakers used this and many other tricks to make the lovable half-giant appear so much larger than life: Another had Robbie Coltrane, who is only 6-foot-1, seated at a split-level table, one higher and nearer the camera and one lower and further away, to achieve a forced perspective effect that made the actor appear huge across from his companion. You can try it out for yourself on the tour ― photos encouraged. Tickets can be found on the “Harry Potter” Warner Bros. Studio Tour website. From June 1 to 30, HuffPost is celebrating the 20th anniversary of the very first “Harry Potter” book by reminiscing about all things Hogwarts. Accio childhood memories."
ARTS & CULTURE,Stephen Colbert Likens Trump Presidency To Worst Musical Ever At The Tonys,"Stephen Colbert, never soft on President Donald Trump, couldn’t get through the 2017 Tony Awards without squeezing in a few comedic digs at him. While presenting the award for Best Revival of a Musical, Colbert compared Trump’s presidency to what sounded like one of the worst revivals to ever hit (wayyy) off-Broadway. “It’s been a great year for revivals in general, especially that one they revived down in Washington, D.C.,” Colbert explained, recounting a show that, he said, started in the 1980s “on Fifth Avenue.” “Huge production values,” he added, before pointing out a few problems: namely, that the main character was “totally unbelievable.” “And the hair and makeup? Yeesh,” the “Late Show” host said over a laughing crowd’s applause. “This D.C. production is supposed to have a four-year run, but reviews have not been kind. Could close early ― we don’t know! We don’t know.” Stephen Colbert: Jokes Trump is ""supposed to have a four year run but reviews have not been kind. It could close early."" #TonyAwards pic.twitter.com/HIYg0jmbis The award presented by Colbert eventually went to “Hello, Dolly!,” which beat out competitor “Miss Saigon,” a production Colbert described as “the only pageant girl whose dressing room our president hasn’t walked in on.” Colbert’s performance had people on Twitter calling for him to host the Tonys next year. If we’re in the business of nominating new hosts, can we also put Rachel Bloom in the running?"
ARTS & CULTURE,Aisle View: Stirring Up The Deplorables,"Just how do you take some old play—W. Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar, the Tony (Antonius) Award winner from 1599, for instance—and give it gut-wrenching relevance in Central Park circa today? Oskar Eustis goes for the jugular by surrounding his small-handed Caesar with thugs, handlers, and a trophy wife with an Eastern European accent. Obvious, perhaps, but instantly effective; what we get is a gripping tale of power-lust, murder and anarchy in the Capitol. Two-thirds of which might seem awfully familiar to those who read the morning papers (a.k.a. the “fake” morning papers).  The immediate result is that these olden characters from ancient Rome—Brutus, Cassius, Antony et al—seem to be of our time, speaking directly to us. None of this clambering about in togas; everybody is contemporary, with the members of the mob (commoners, as Shakespeare called them) indistinguishable from the members of the free admission Public audience. Eustis—the Public Theater artistic director, as well as stage director of this production—heightens the effect by building the production on contemporary performances from strong stage performers. Corey Stoll—of the Public’s recent Plenty, and widely familiar for his performance as disgraced congressman Peter Russo in the first season of “House of Cards”—makes a noble and conflicted Brutus. John Douglas Thompson, a Tony-nominee for January’s Jitney, commands the stage as Cassius, while Teagle F. Bougere adds power as Casca. Most arresting of the group is Elizabeth Marvel as Marc Antony (here played and referred to as a woman, which doesn’t quite make sense in context.) Even so, Marvel—who has five Public Theater credits, and is a cable celebrity thanks to her role as President-elect Elizabeth Keane in last season’s “Homeland”—brings rabble-rousing power to the role. The relatively unknown Gregg Henry makes a strong impression as the buffoonish president. That is, as Mr. Caesar, until he gets fileted in the Senate. (He is actually stripped naked at one point—in a rather humorous and fitting Emperor’s New Clothes tableaux—and one can only imagine he must get awfully cold up there some nights.) Tina Benko gets laughs as the model-spouse, Calpurnia, while Nikki M. James (of The Book of Mormon) offers support as Portia, wife to Brutus. Eustis peoples the vast Delacorte stage—designed by David Rockwell as if ancient Rome was located midway between DC and Occupy Wall Street—with a veritable mob. While the cast lists twenty-six players, an informal count suggests that there are enough extras around to swell the number close to fifty. The notion of a modern-themed Julius Caesar is not novel, exactly; Orson Welles set Broadway spinning with his Mussolini-flavored performance in the 1937 anti-fascist, Mercury Theatre production. The current Trumpian version is attention getting, certainly, and enhances the drama. The real-to-life links go astray, methinks, once the title character meets his fate on the Ides of March and cedes the spotlight for most of the rest of the evening.  But when Cassius asks, “How many ages hence shall this our lofty scene be acted over in states unborn and accents yet unknown?” we can only answer that we know one such age all too well.  Familiar Shakespearean quotes abound in Julius Caesar, and Mr. Eustis pointedly mentions—in his program notes—that “we didn’t write any new lines, it’s all Shakespeare.” Although there is indeed a joke (?) about Caesar getting away with it if he stabbed his mother on Fifth Avenue. Which doesn’t quite sound like the authentical Bard, but we do seem to have heard something of the sort elsewhere. Maybe it’s from Christopher Marlowe? The Public Theater production of William Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar opened May 23, 2017 and continues through June 18 at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park "
ARTS & CULTURE,Trump’s Insidious Dual Assault On The American Creative Class,"Americans for the Arts, the leading arts advocacy group in the nation, reports that the White House just released official details of its FY2018 “skinny budget,” proposed by President Trump in March. In this latest version, the president doubles down on his recommendation to eliminate the key federal agencies for the arts, humanities, museums, libraries, and public broadcasting, allocating only “expenses necessary to carry out their closure.” The budget proposal also eliminates important arts education and afterschool grant programs. The proposed destruction of these national arts and humanities programs threatens not only the survival of our country’s cultural producers but also the cultural health of our entire society. Defunding the arts is a tactic used by the Trump White House not only to destroy cultural identity in America but also to harm individuals directly through the Draconian GOP health care bill. LA author and journalist Scott Timberg, in his 2015 book, “Culture Crash, the Killing of the Creative Class” describes the “middle class-creatives,” the artists, musicians, writers, dancers and architects that tend to be free-lance entrepreneurs and do not normally find health care via employers but look to programs like Obamacare that applies to free-lance workers. “However imperfect its rollout and execution so far, it is among the rare good news the creative class has gotten in recent years.” As Trump and the GOP move to eviscerate health care for many of our country’s most vulnerable populations, it is imperative that we also focus on arts programs for those same populations that are simultaneously being undermined by destroying funding for the arts. For more than 50 years, the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), in particular, has expanded access to the arts for all Americans, awarding grants in every Congressional district throughout all 50 states and U.S. Territories, as well as placing arts therapists in 12 military hospitals to help returning soldiers heal from traumatic brain injuries. The NEA is also an economic powerhouse, generating more than $600 million annually in additional matching funds and helping to shape a $730 billion arts and culture industry that represents 4.2% of the nation’s GDP and supports 4.8 million jobs. These facts don’t faze Trump or others in the GOP, some of whom have sought to undermine the arts in our country for years all the while ignoring these important statistics. My work to support the arts is an extension of my passion for social justice and my commitment to help build a culture and community that provides nurture and support for all segments of our diverse society. A significant percentage of NEA grants, for example, go to those who have fewer opportunities to participate in the arts. 40% of NEA supported activities take place in high-poverty neighborhoods. 36% of NEA grants go to organizations that reach underserved populations such as people with disabilities, people in institutions and veterans. 33% of NEA grants serve low-income audiences. As a philanthropist, I’ve focused on a collaborative-partnership model in grant giving, where the David Bohnett Foundation partners with our grantees and then brings in other funders and like-minded social service groups to help with the effort. Cuts to the National Endowment for the Arts and similar programs that solicit matching gifts from private donors undermines the strength of these collaborative funding models. Trump boasts that these eliminations are “part of the Administration’s plan to move the Nation toward fiscal responsibility and to redefine the proper role of the Federal Government.” This is nonsense. The NEA’s budget is just 0.004 percent of the federal budget. That amounts to 47 cents per capita. In fact, the NEA budget has been losing its share of federal discretionary spending and failing to keep pace with inflation. In the barrage of distractions coming out of the White House and from members of Congress, I’m frustrated that no one is talking about the importance of the arts in terms of how they define us as a people and as a society. For me, the arts reflect civilization. As President John F. Kennedy once said, “I am certain that after the dust of centuries has passed over our cities, we, too, will be remembered not for our victories or defeats in battle or in politics, but for our contribution to the human spirit.” What I strive to do within my own community is to help everyone lift their head up and see how our individual struggles fit into the larger context of the broader human rights struggles. I think we’re better served if we’re champions for social justice for all. For me, the survival of the arts is a significant part of that mission. Please contact your member of Congress to urge them to #SAVEtheNEA and these other cultural agencies. Find your representatives for the House and the Senate.  And be sure to look up and include your own story of how NEA grants have impacted the arts in your state and Congressional district. Americans for the Arts offers helpful suggestions on their web site.  Congress is now our only firewall to prevent the president’s extreme proposals from being enacted. The budget must still go through the House and Senate. Together, we must fight to save funding for these agencies and ensure universal health remains a reality."
ARTS & CULTURE,10 Lost Buildings Of New York City,"For Architectural Digest, by Carrie Hojnicki. As ardent as New York’s architectural preservation movement is today, historians are quick to remind us that it wasn’t always this way. With the skyscraper boom of the early 20th century and then the modernist construction fervor of the 1960s and 70s, a number of extraordinary buildings met their untimely demise, making way for the city we know today. Perhaps the most famous of these, and one that still haunts architectural historians and city residents alike, is the demolition of the original Pennsylvania Station, whose dismantling was met with a now-famous New York Times editorial pronouncing: “A city gets what it wants, is willing to pay for, and ultimately deserves.” But for as many unfortunate parables, there are victories to be celebrated, and extraordinary structures to be remembered. Here, 10 remarkable buildings that once grazed the New York City skyline. Arguably the city’s most famous lost building, the original McKim, Mead, and White–designed Penn Station, erected in 1910, was demolished in 1963 to an outcry of public criticism. The building’s exorbitant maintenance costs drove the city officials to replace the Beaux-Arts structure with the modernist Penn Plaza that exists today. Designed by architect Alfred B. Mullett, the City Hall post office occupied a triangular lot across from New York’s City Hall, whose original structure still stands today. Completed in 1880, the mansard-roofed building was considered an eyesore (even nicknamed Mullett’s Monstrosity) until its destruction in 1939. Before moving to its Park Avenue home, the iconic Waldorf-Astoria hotel occupied two separate German Renaissance structures on Manhattan’s Fifth Avenue that were owned by two feuding Astor relatives. In 1929 the two buildings were demolished to make way for what would become the Empire State Building. Home to the Singer Manufacturing Company, the 47-floor Singer building was erected in 1908 and was briefly the tallest building in the world. Upon its demolition in 1966, the Singer tower was the tallest edifice to be intentionally destroyed. One of New York’s largest theaters at the time of its construction in 1905, the Hippodrome was the brainchild of Coney Island developers Frederic Thompson and Elmer Dundy. The theater was razed in 1939 and is today home to a midtown office building bearing the same name. More: 22 Incredible Indian Palaces (You Can Stay At)  Adjacent to Grand Central Terminal, the Warren and Wetmore–designed Biltmore hotel opened in 1913 as part of the city’s Terminal City Development, which also included the Roosevelt Hotel (still in operation today) and the Commodore Hotel. The building was stripped to its skeleton in 1981 and rebuilt as Bank of America Plaza. At Riverside Drive and 73rd Street sat the opulent 75-room residence of steel magnate Charles M. Schwab. Completed in 1907, the Maurice Hebert–designed home was razed in 1948 to make way for an apartment complex bearing the businessman’s name. Erected in 1918 as a temporary structure commemorating the New York soldiers who fought in World War I, the Victory Arch stood just north of the Flatiron Building at the intersection of 24th Street and 5th Avenue. The Fifth Avenue home of wealthy textile merchant Isaac Vail Brokaw, the Brokaw mansion was the centerpiece of a collection of nearby homes owned by Brokaw and his family. The home was demolished in 1966 to a scathing New York Times editorial titled “Rape of the Brokaw Mansion.” Headquarters to the late newspaper empire bearing its name, the New York Tribune Building was built in 1875 by architect Richard Morris Hunt. The brick-and-stone building, famous for its protruding clock tower, was razed in 1966.

ARTS & CULTURE,Sponsors Pull Out Of Trump-Inspired 'Julius Caesar' Show With Assassination Scene,"Delta Air Lines has pulled its sponsorship from New York’s Public Theater after a staging of “Julius Caesar” included Caesar depicted as President Donald Trump, assassination and all. The modernized production is one of the shows at this year’s “Shakespeare in the Park,” and the characters look eerily familiar. The Public Theatre’s Artistic Director, Oskar Eustis, replaces the Roman’s toga and crown for a business suit and golden haircut in a more modern retelling of the classic Shakespeare tragedy. And Caesar’s wife, Calpurnia? Deadline described her as “swathed and swaddled in free-flowing silk, totters about in spike heels and speaks with a heavy Slavic accent.” Sounds a lot like Trump and the first lady, Melania, an immigrant from Slovenia. And of course the play would be incomplete without the most famous scene of all: Caesar’s death.  Et tu, Brute?  Following Kathy Griffin’s messy Trump joke, it may seem hard to believe that another depiction of a dead president exists, but it’s true. Inside Edition reports that the show is drawing mixed reactions, with some people feeling uncomfortable and others finding it art.  Amid the backlash, a spokesperson from Delta gave HuffPost a statement on severing its ties with the theater:  No matter what your political stance may be, the graphic staging of Julius Caesar at this summer’s Free Shakespeare in the Park does not reflect Delta Air Lines’ values. Their artistic and creative direction crossed the line on the standards of good taste. We have notified them of our decision to end our sponsorship as the official airline of The Public Theater effective immediately. Not long after Delta’s announcement, Bank Of America said it was withdrawing its funding for the updated “Julius Caesar.” The company issued a public statement on its Twitter page: We are withdrawing our funding pic.twitter.com/MlaONF82FN HuffPost has yet to receive a statement from The Public Theater. The show, put on at The Delacorte Theater in Central Park, doesn’t advertise any ties to the president, but Eustis posted a note to the show’s website on the meaning of “Julius Caesar” and its ties to democracy. “When history is happening, when the ground is slipping away from under us and all that is solid melts into the air, leadership is as transitory and flawed as the times,” Eustis wrote onto the site. “It’s the extraordinary quality of Shakespeare’s writing to seem fresh, and new, whenever we encounter it again.” Five years ago, The Acting Company put on a version of “Julius Caesar” that depicted then-President Barack Obama as the title character. The current “Julius Caesar” shows for free in Central Park until June 18.  This article has been updated with comments from Delta Air Lines and Bank of America. "
ARTS & CULTURE,A Complete List Of The 2017 Tony Award Winners,"The 2017 Tony Awards have finally arrived. One year after “Hamilton: An American Musical” vied for a record 16 statues at the annual ceremony, the Broadway scene looks a little different. Without a clear Tonys frontrunner, a number of critically-acclaimed musicals and plays competed for recognition, including favorites like the Ben Platt–led musical “Dear Evan Hansen” and the Pulitzer-winning play “Sweat.” (The former prevailed, while the latter lost to “Oslo.”)  Hosted by your favorite “House of Cards” villain Kevin Spacey, the 71st edition of the awards show featured an impressive roster of celebrities: Mark Hamill introduced the night’s “In Memoriam” segment that paid tribute to his former co-star, Carrie Fisher. Another “Star Wars” alum, 86-year-old James Earl Jones, was honored with a Tony for lifetime achievement. Bette Midler won her first competitive Tony award for her performance in “Hello, Dolly!” (She unfortunately did not perform; co-star David Hyde Pierce took her place.) Other stars who made appearances included Stephen Colbert, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Tina Fey, Keegan-Michael Key and more. And Broadway fans outside of New York City caught performances from several musicals beyond “Dear Evan Hansen,” like “Come From Away,” “Groundhog Day,” “Natasha, Pierre & The Great Comet of 1812,” “Falsettos” and “Miss Saigon.” Taking place a year after the devastating shooting at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, the 2017 ceremony was a joyous occasion filled with emotional speeches. Check out every win of the night below, so you can continue the Tony toasting long after the broadcast on CBS.

ARTS & CULTURE,Read A Chapter Of Mark Twain’s Previously Unpublished Children’s Book,"Earlier this year, Penguin Random House announced it would take Mark Twain’s ephemera and transform it into a full-fledged children’s story. The resulting chapter book ― The Purloining of Prince Oleomargarine ― will be published in September. The book is based on a 16-page story recorded by Twain in 1879, after he told it aloud to his daughters before bed. In it, a young man is granted the ability to speak to animals ― including his beloved pet chicken ― and his gift helps him on his quest to save a young prince. The book is co-written by Twain and Philip Stead, who used the classic author’s notes to craft the tale. Erin Stead, a Caldecott-winning artist, is its illustrator.  The below excerpt is from the first chapter of The Purloining of Prince Oleomargarine.  If we concentrate very carefully now, we will find ourselves in exactly the place we need to be. In fact, we will find ourselves in a land not all that far from here — not all that far, but hard enough to find that you’re likely never to get there. I have tried. This land has a name, but it is much too difficult to pronounce. It would not be dignified to try. Of course, our land, the United States of America, rolls effortlessly off the tongue and is so easy to find that you’re likely to spend half your life looking for the way out. So already, you see, we’ve described two differences between Here and There. Another difference to consider: In the hard-to-find-and-difficult-to-pronounce land in which our story takes place, the luckless and hungry remain luckless and hungry for all of their lives. By contrast, in the United States of America, everyone and everything is given a fair and equal chance. It would be rude to believe otherwise! Here — be it Michigan or Missouri — the luckless and hungry are likely to stub a toe, look down, and discover at their feet a soup bowl full of gold bullion. Eureka! But There, the luckless and hungry are likely to stub a toe, look down, and discover only the dried-up root of a withered, old apple tree. Which is exactly what Johnny, our hero, has just discovered — “Eureka!” he exclaimed. He said Eureka!, and not something far worse, because long ago he’d made up his mind never to swear — not even when swearing was the necessity of a situation (as it often is). Johnny’s poor, wretched grandfather swore often enough for the both of them. His cursings hung like a cloud over their unhappy home. Once, when Johnny was very young, a flock of pigeons became lost in this fog and dropped dead from despair, the whole lot of “them belly-up on the roof. That is a fact. And it is, also, the reason that Johnny chose to carry a moral compass, in case he, too, ever became lost and needed to find his way. Johnny had known no other family. And to say he knew his grandfather would be an optimism at best. And since a great many of the world’s tragedies, big and small, were first thunk up in the minds of optimists, we will do humanity a favor now and stick to the cold facts:  Johnny’s grandfather was a bad man. Johnny’s only true companion was a melancholic chicken with a peculiar name. Her name was: Pestilence and Famine. Presumably at some time in the past, there were two chickens — one Pestilence and one Famine. But again, we must stick to the facts. Now there is one chicken, and she goes by two names. Pestilence and Famine wandered over to peck weakly at Johnny’s battered toe in sympathy. “Thank you,” said Johnny. “I think it will be alright.” He hopped around on one foot. The chicken did likewise, thinking it the thing to do. Johnny smiled at his old friend. This is how our chicken got her name — For as long as Johnny could remember, his grandfather would greet the day by thundering out into the yard, kicking dirt into the air, and calling out to no one in particular, Pestilence and famine! Pestilence and famine! Pestilence and Famine thought this was great fun. She would set down her melancholy for a moment, prance around on skinny legs, and flap her ragged wings in delight. Then Johnny’s grandfather would go inside, lie down on the dirt floor, and nap till well past noon. As he slept, he would coo softly and sing a gentle love song. This was when Johnny loved his grandfather best. Johnny had never heard two words of kindness from his grandfather. And so it was a great surprise to Johnny when his grandfather stepped out of their broken-down shack and into the yard to ask, “Are you alright? Can you walk?” Johnny’s heart filled with happiness. “Yes!” he said. “I will be alright, thank you!” “Good,” replied his grandfather. “Then walk to market and sell that chicken for something worth eating.”"
ARTS & CULTURE,Artist Realizes Only Appropriate Use Of Trump Tweets Is Plant Food,"President Donald Trump’s tweets might be polluting the natural environment that is your mind, but they’re finding greater purpose somewhere: specifically, in a subterranean lavender field in New York City. Austrian artist Martin Roth, now based in NYC, is the mad gardener behind an idyllic new art exhibition, which happens to be powered in part by Trump’s 140-character declarations. Nestled inside the Austrian Cultural Forum of Midtown Manhattan, it consists of 200 lavender shrubs that are nurtured by grow lights whose power corresponds with the activities of several social media accounts. That’s right, the strength of the bulbs depends on how frequently accounts like @POTUS, @realDonaldTrump, @PressSec and @KellyannePolls issue a tweet. (Other connected accounts: @foxandfriends, @seanhannity, @tuckercarlson, @breitbartnews, @heritage, @CNN and @washingtonpost.) Motivated by the “heightened anxiety” many have felt in the wake of Trump’s election, the arrangement is meant to turn the chaos of our present political reality into something capable of assuaging our collective terror. “The pace and tenor of the current political discourse, blasted out through social media 24/7 without respite, affects our psyche in a profound way,” Martin told Mashable. “I’m interested in Twitter because it seemed to be the only news getting through. It’s fast and used as a political weapon, but ... it seems overall just to be there to distract us.” Using eight tons of soil, six rows of lavender and a soothing backdrop of nature-adorned wallpaper, Martin has created what appears at first to be place of refuge, a fragrance-filled spot where art lovers can stop to, quite literally, smell the flowers. However, they can’t do so without wondering just how many tweets are flying through the digital ether at any given moment. If the lavender is thriving, so too are POTUS and co.’s statuses. The effect, Hyperallergic’s Claire Voon notes, is amplified by “the windowless, concrete space,” which she describes as “claustrophobic.” Even when the air smells like perfume, something capable of transcending the underground sanctuary is probably amiss ― you just can’t see it. “The total effect is less an immersion into the woods, and more a sojourn in a doomsday bunker of the One-Percent,” Kate Sutton wrote in an essay that appears on the Forum’s website. “Any calm this environment induces is innately tinged by suspicion of its circumstances.” You can visit the not-so-subtle installation until June 21."
ARTS & CULTURE,"The Urgency Of Indecent Art: Paula Vogel On Love, Creation And Injustice","Paula Vogel’s “Indecent” is many things: an idiosyncratic mix of music, memory and theater magic; a female take on an infamous male intellectual; a Holocaust parable that manages to surprise; a lesbian love story both lyrical and consumed with lust; a provocative piece of found history that holds up an eerie mirror to our times. The Pulitzer-winning playwright, author of more than a dozen distinctive works, has been talking to countless audiences about her first show to land on Broadway—a piece that has been germinating since her twentysomething self—and two decades later another student, future “Indecent” co-creator/director Rebecca Taichman—separately discovered the same censored story. Vogel spoke with me a few days before the Tonys, which she planned to attend as a Best Play nominee. Is it strange to be where you are now? Are you surprised to be on Broadway? I find it just a continuation of what I’ve been doing. It’s like going from Rhode Island to Texas—the roads are the same, and the people are lovely, just everything’s a slightly larger scale. Do audiences react in ways you don’t expect? I’m really amazed the audience who come to see the show respond in the way I responded when I wrote it, that they laugh and cry and that they want to talk about it. Whenever I can, I stop in front of the theater, and conversations with audiences can go on for an hour to two hours after the show …. I’ve always said that playwrights write the script, and the director and the cast and the designers write the production, but the play is actually written by each audience member. So every night there are 500 different plays. When I come out, people want to tell me the play they saw. Theater is such a fragile living thing; I marvel at the bravery of everyone involved in it. When you were a little girl, did you think this was what you’d grow up to be? I grew up below the poverty line in a fairly dysfunctional family, and the thought of going to a restaurant, much less going to a theater, was sort of out of the question. It wasn’t until I was 15 years old in high school and I walked into a drama class—I couldn’t believe what I was seeing and hearing. And the teacher said, “Just sit down. Take a seat and be quiet.” I stayed through a rehearsal of “Skin of Our Teeth,” and I went up to him, I said, “I don’t ever want to leave.” And he said, “Okay, you can sign up for the class.” And he put me to work; my first job was stage manager. From that point on—I think every theater artist tells you the same story—I was hooked. I’ve never been bored a day in my life since that day. Of course, each production is at the mercy of the individual dynamics of the people in it—it can be heaven, it can be hell. But you forget all the hells when you’re in heaven. Do you remember a moment where you realized you were in fact a playwright? I put it off for a long, long time, saying that, which I sometimes think is symptomatic of women. I started teaching when I was 23, at Cornell, and my job became all-consuming—at age 33 at Brown University I designed and ran the playwriting program there, raised money so that it was free for anyone admitted, plus we gave them stipends—and I was writing plays, but I didn’t really say, “Okay, I’m a playwright,” until I wrote “Baltimore Waltz.” There was something about that experience—finding that theater could literally not only change my life but change my emotional DNA, in a way I hadn’t realized until I lost my brother to AIDS. I realized that theater can bring back the dead, that theater is always in the present tense, instead of people who are in the past tense. There is that strange alchemy we feel when we enter an empty theater: There’s a ghosting that happens, and an energy actors leave behind when they’re creating a character who doesn’t exactly exist but [whom] they’re giving their own life force to, and that energy remains behind on the stage. All of us who work in theater feel it. How did you invent the vocabulary to take something so painful and find comedy? I think it’s a family voice—the funniest, most alive moments I’ve spent are sitting shiva for my grandfather, or at the funerals—the stories that are told, the laughter. Is it painful? Yes, but “Baltimore Waltz” made me believe in catharsis, and I discovered as I wrote about my brother that I felt joyful. That there was a release, a comedy. I actually now believe that if we don’t laugh, we can’t grieve. That strange exhilaration that I think also exists in [Vogel’s Pulitzer-winning] “How I Learned to Drive,” and certainly exists in “Indecent,” is really having a great wake, a great shiva—just a great party for people we’ve lost. Because there’s something frozen if we don’t allow ourselves to experience the full panoply of human emotions.  As a culture we are terrified of facing grief and facing death. We change the subject, we don’t delve in deeply enough—it’s seen as being morbid. I don’t think it’s emotionally healthy. Theater is very much a conduit of not being frozen, of facing something collectively so that we can change our emotional DNA. We leave the theater feeling a kind of lightness of being. “Baltimore Waltz” sprang from your need to address the loss of your brother. Was there a particular kernel that sparked “Indecent”? Actually, I think in a way I continue to write in a conversation with my brother. All of us who have lost somebody too young know this experience. I’m 30 years older than my [late] older brother, but I’m still having the conversations in my head. He actually said something about that when he was dying, that finally I would get the last word. Do you? Or does he answer? [Laughs] As long as he could read—he lost his sight as one of the last senses that he was losing from HIV—he delved into Holocaust literature. When I asked him why, he said, “Do you realize that half of our family has always been killing off the other half?” And I thought about it: Russian Jew, German Jew, German Catholic, German Protestant. Spanish and French. And that’s what was happening in his body, half of his body was killing off the other half. That ancestry of violence had actually worked down to the cellular level. That’s not at all profound! [Laughs] Even if I am not a survivor, still in all, the Holocaust, for those of us of certain generations, lives in our body. So many younger people I’ve taught don’t feel it in their body; they think of it as a historical fact. I guess I was thinking of my brother: How can I write something that when younger people see it, the notion of Shoah lives in their bones? And not in a traumatizing way. My friend whom I brought to the theater said, “Is this going to be a Jewish play or a gay play?” You tell me. [Laughs] I would hope the specific of the story makes us think of the universality of immigrants, and America as an immigrant nation, and at what price and at what times and danger do we erect borders and walls. The truth of the matter is what we’re asking everyone is to do is what Sholem Asch did in 1906—we’re asking everyone to say, “Yes, I’m a lesbian.” When we think that he said that to a Yiddish theater audience, and Yiddish culture, in 1906, that’s profound. It frustrates me what stories are not considered mainstream, not validated as being worthy of Broadway. What I am hoping is that I live long enough to see “How I Learned to Drive” and “Baltimore Waltz” on Broadway. For a long time it’s been said to me, “Oh, you’ve written a woman’s play, it’s not universal”—and it’s so astonishing that we are making decisions on healthcare for women with an all-male panel in Washington, D.C.— And the notion that anything to do with childbirth is a “chick” thing, as if human beings would exist without it. There are plenty of days where I cry in my tea, but then there are other days—and one of the days was when we moved the show to Broadway. People say to me, “How do you feel?” It’s kind of funny and makes me laugh: If you just stand outside the club long enough, one day they’ll forget and keep the door open and you can just sneak in. The Mary Louise Parker/David Morse Vineyard production of “How I Learned to Drive” was one of the most perfect things I’ve ever seen. It stays with me still. That was a heaven. Everybody thought that it was on Broadway, in retrospect, isn’t that interesting? So then it was interesting to be told that it’s not a universal story, it’s not Broadway material... There’s a play I have to read, I understand it’s wonderful, a two-person play [with subject matter similar to “HILTD”] written by a British writer: “Blackbird.” Not only has it been on Broadway but the revival now has been on Broadway. I hope that in the next 10 years my plays will be seen as universal as his are seen. I think we find excuses to exclude women while ignoring the practice of what’s [accepted when the authors are male. “Indecent”] is an homage to a male writer who’s very beloved and is in the canon, [which I did] purposefully to try to break through. You’ve been a mentor to many people. Is that how art is allowed to happen? Is that the only way that it does? I had mentors in teaching; I didn’t have mentors in theater. Mentoring for me was a selfish thing: That was how I tried to stop being bitter and write the next play, by believing in our art and craft. What better way than to surround yourself with really remarkable voices? And it stopped me from feeling self-pity, it stopped me from going, “Oh yeah, he got on Broadway and I didn’t.” I’m going to continue writing because it’s the only way I can feel and think about the world. You just believe in the importance of doing this for a lifetime. I always said I wanted people to enter [the classroom] as my students and leave as my peers and colleagues, and that I wanted them to make it in the field before I did. And I have seen several of my students on Broadway, so this isn’t my first time. As a mentor and a godparent and a fan and a believer I’ve been [on Broadway] for Nilo Cruz, for Quiara Hudes, for Sarah Ruhl, and they’ve all honored me by sitting next to me to watch their play. It’s not about getting through the door alone; it’s about forming circles. Circles rise faster than individuals can. So much of the resonance of “Indecent,” its timeliness about the foreclosing of the humanity of whole groups of people, and the hatred and the fear we live with today—one can say, “Everything is so urgent; how can I waste my time making art?” But it seems even more urgent now than ever that we speak to our creative spirit in light of the daily horrors in our current situation. I was particularly struck in “Indecent” by Asch’s inability to defend his production when it was attacked. In a conventional drama he would leap to champion his own work. I was somewhat mad at him that he didn’t defend the play. I did 40 drafts of “Indecent,” maybe 20 by the time we got to New Haven and the other half late at night while we were in previews, and as we were going from New Haven to La Jolla, so it took me a while to understand for myself: Our heroes are wounded. How do you write a wounded hero? How do you forgive a wounded hero? I started reading about the pogroms, trying to walk in his shoes, and then listening to how he spoke at 1950 and realizing how he must’ve sounded in 1923. He was painfully aware that he couldn’t speak English—and he was this brilliant, international, celebrated writer. What is that like, when people only hear the immigrant and not the writer? And we now look at the world with a different understanding of PTSD, which he must have felt, documenting the bodies on the street. What actually helped me was that terrifying image, I think it was an AP picture, when an aid worker picked up the body of a little 3-year-old who had washed up on shore, who would have been fleeing the massacres in Syria, this little boy had lost one of his shoes, and the limp little body—it so destroyed me that I thought, “Of course, this is what he was seeing on a daily basis.” You said you sprang from a dysfunctional family. Were they able to be proud of your achievements? My father left home when I was 10. Both parents were dysfunctional—very funny and very brilliant and very dysfunctional. My mother did live long enough to see “How I Learned to Drive,” it was the first play of mine she’d seen. She was thrilled; she stayed up all night with me as the reviews were coming in and read every one. I had dedicated the play to her, but she died before the publication came out. My dad kind of floated in and out of my life, mostly out, and would disappear, but one night I came home and turned on my voicemail and it was my dad saying, “Honey, I just saw ‘How I Learned to Drive,’” and he started to cry. When I heard his voice I turned to my partner and said, “I think my dad is dying.” And he was dead in six months. At least it was wonderful to have that opportunity to hear them be proud before they died. Is your partner an artist as well? No. We’ve been together 28 years and married since—when did it become legal—2004. She is a biologist—and a biologist of gender study. She’s pretty brilliant. She’s kind of a pioneer, she’s written books. I’m used to carrying the luggage for her when she goes on these international speaking engagements. I really love it when theater artists within different schools say, “Anne Fausto-Sterling is your wife?!” She’s really groundbreaking. It’s wonderful to have two writers in the same house writing from very different perspectives. We read each other’s work. Her world is remarkable to me. How did you meet? We met at Brown University—she was the big woman on campus. We actually met first and I instantly fell in love, but we were both involved with other people, and I went, Oh, that’s why God created cold showers. And then four years later, what do you do when you’re breaking up: You go to the gym! I met Professor Sterling at the gym. It’s been an extraordinary gift to see the world through her work. It’s an interesting juggling act, because she is so engaged in her research and I’m teaching, that we kind of negotiate when we come to each other’s events and block off time. But I’m about to go to Spain to hear her new lectures in Madrid and Barcelona, and I can’t wait. Have you seen a marked change in the response to your work since the ’90s with “Hot and Throbbing” and “Baltimore Waltz”? We’ve lunged ahead in awareness and—I don’t want to say “acceptance”—maybe communion on the subject of sexuality generally. You were writing these things at a time when it was much more difficult to be gay. I’ve felt progress, but I must also say that I’m very worried that we’re facing an extreme counterrevolution. What people haven’t remarked upon—”Hot and Throbbing” is only done at 90-seat theaters. One of the prime concerns of my life, having witnessed it, is violence against women—and that we call it domestic violence instead of really properly criminalizing it—and it hasn’t changed. Violence against women and children has not changed, it’s not been eradicated, and the other thing that hasn’t been eradicated is the sexual trade in women and girls. One of the things that’s interesting about “Indecent” is this was going on in 1906. Women are still being sold and enslaved—there is a worldwide trade and it is not looked at. So in terms of progress, gay progress and lesbian progress—I always find everything intertwined—we are not looking at racial and sexual justice and racial and sexual injustice. Any progress we make, to me, is fleeting because underneath it there’s the smoldering coal about to break out in conflagration of a hatred and a subjugation of women—and we’re not paying attention to that, and it’s smoldering away. I keep saying to younger women, “I’m from a generation that remembers when women died in the back streets from abortion.” That’s sort of my response to it: Yes, there’s progress, but the basic difficulty has not been examined, and we’re hiding it. Prior to the election I lived in constant dread because there’s such hatred of women, among women as well—the women who are so socialized, so brainwashed that they turn their self-loathing outward and hate other women. It’s terrifying. We’re watching the counterrevolution and it seems inconceivable, but it’s happening. What has successfully been broken is the notion of coalition that I feel we’ve had at really important periods. The notion that—how can we celebrate progress when a man is choked to death by police because he’s selling cigarettes on the street? Why is that hidden? It’s in plain view. How are we celebrating gay liberation when there is a policing of the body that is ending up in countless deaths, and they’re not prosecuted? How free is our freedom? Only a few people have realized that in “Indecent” the way the women express desire is by saying, “I can’t breathe.” Whatever our liberation is, and whenever we do get to express ourselves, there’s a constant awareness that our bodies may be policed as a result of that expression. They do not belong to us. That’s right. And I don’t mean this to be glum. One of the hopes I have is that a younger generation will think of how to forge a coalition. There have been, briefly, coalitions between gay men and lesbians that keep getting severed. To me, to be a gay man—and this is based on the model of my brother—is to be a feminist, so I’m constantly in shock when I meet gay men who are not, or who call women that awful word, breeders. It’s extraordinary—I have not had children, I wanted to have children, but I always think when anyone has a child, they’re having in some sense someone who is in my family. Whoever gets born, that’s in my family, my community has increased. What the Republican right has done, very successfully, is broken up a coalition to where we’re now thinking of ourselves as nuclear families and nuclear communities instead of the larger community. How do we get back community values and eradicate the limits of family values—or enlarge the limits of family values where we’re talking about a larger family? The human family. Can you tell I’m a child of the ’60s? Trump is masterful at sowing chaos, but the searing editorials in the Washington Post, the New York Times, the L.A. Times, don’t do anything to puncture that chaos, because it’s so emotionally successful, so blunt and simple. I read a writer who pointed out that Republicans are skilled at framing something in the most direct emotional terms and the Democrats have not learned how to do that. I’ve been trying to figure out how to frame the truth—we have truth on our side, so why can’t we express it in simple terms that cut through the chaos? It’s hiding in plain sight, as you said, but we’re not giving it weight—because it’s not “chic,” somehow. We have to find language that gets through to everybody. I may not have the same trust in words, and the power of words, because what’s been under assault—there’s been an emptying of content of each word. Words mean polar opposites according to what party you belong to. Plus the entire sentence itself is suspect depending on what media outlet it comes from. We have actually trained a population to not believe not only in facts but in the words that bear them. Now this is where I feel some hope: I think that the reason Trump has so succeeded, like Hitler and Mussolini before him, is that they emotionalized words, they made words empty of their content and they emotionalized certain expressions and words. So what we’re responding to is emotional language and not cognitive language. The good news is that that is exactly what theater and film and music and songs do. When we talk about who can run as a Democrat: Who can emotionalize words? Bernie Sanders emotionalizes words, to some extent. Elizabeth Warren can to some extent emotionalize words. Who else is out there? To me—and it leads right back to “Indecent”—it’s not arbitrary that one of the first things that Hitler did was divide art into degenerate art and nationalist art. So all of the art that was emotionalizing the truth, giving us an emotional language, was suppressed and burnt until only national art remained. I think of the extraordinary artists in the ghettos who hid their photographs or hid their drawings so that people could see what the truth was afterwards. It’s not coincidental that the attack on the NEA started in 1980 by Jesse Helms. And the Republicans have long been trying to suppress the emotional language that arts gives us. This is where I think Sholem Asch was wrong: I think it’s precisely at the time of crisis that we need to create novels and theater and movies and television, because that’s the only thing that gives us a resilience—to show us that emotional truth. We do have to not just rely on individual artwork but create community work, go back to what we did in the ’30s with the WPA and the Federalist projects that were out there, make it accessible for everybody. Maybe we can create a framework for that to happen. I would love that."
ARTS & CULTURE,Banksy Pulls Free UK Election Print Offer Amid Police Probe,"Banksy has pulled a plan to send free prints to Brits who don’t vote for the incumbent Conservative government in this week’s election because he’s been warned it would “invalidate” the result. The anonymous street artist said Saturday he would mail prints to voters in six electoral districts in and around his home city of Bristol, southwest England, if they sent him a photo of their ballot paper to prove they hadn’t voted for their local Conservative Party candidate: A post shared by Banksy (@banksy) on Jun 3, 2017 at 8:37am PDT Banksy said he would send them the print, an updated version of his “Girl with balloon” on archival quality paper, to voters the day after Thursday’s election: A post shared by Banksy (@banksy) on Jun 3, 2017 at 8:38am PDT His offer, however, caused controversy as critics accused the artist of attempting to sway voters’ decisions. Local police confirmed in an issued statement that they had received multiple complaints and that they were “investigating the offer.” “It is a criminal offense under the Representation of People Act 1983 for any voter to accept or agree to accept a gift or similar in return for voting or refraining from voting,” the Avon and Somerset police force said in the statement. “Any person participating in an offer to receive a gift is at risk of being prosecuted.” Statement in relation to the offer of a free #Banksy print in exchange for people voting a certain way in the forthcoming general election. pic.twitter.com/XtV5T0Qnbn Banksy announced late Monday that he would scrap the giveaway in light of the police investigation and a warning from the U.K. Electoral Commission. The artist announced his “product recall” in an Instagram post:  A post shared by Banksy (@banksy) on Jun 5, 2017 at 2:53pm PDT The U.K. has strict electoral coverage guidelines and the Electoral Commission has also issued a warning against people against taking selfies in polling stations.  "
ARTS & CULTURE,"17 Years Later, 'Monty Python' Writer Finally Wraps 'Don Quixote' Filming","Most films take only a few months to shoot, but thanks to a string of misfortunes, Terry Gilliam was at it for 17 years to wrap filming on “The Man Who Killed Don Quixote.” The “Monty Python” writer shared the news over Facebook on Sunday.  “Sorry for the long silence,” he began. “I’ve been busy packing the truck and am now heading home. After 17 years, we have completed the shoot of THE MAN WHO KILLED DON QUIXOTE.” A documentary, “Lost in La Mancha,” was released way back in 2002 chronicling Gilliam’s attempts to make the film, which follows an advertising executive who time-travels back and forth between present-day London and 1600s La Mancha, where he meets Spanish author Migel de Cervantes’ obsessively chivalrous Don Quixote.  The project is known for its bad luck. During the first week of filming, in August 2000, flash flooding swept away equipment and changed the color of the natural landscape, making previous footage unusable. The film also faced financial problems. A number of actors cycled through lead roles as production dragged on, and on. While Jean Rochefort was originally cast as Quixote, the role ultimately went to Jonathan Pryce. The role of the ad exec, called Toby, was once rumored to have gone to Johnny Depp, but Adam Driver will appear in ― fingers crossed ― the finished version.  The movie still has to go through post-production, so it’s not in the clear just yet. Gilliam also still stands accused by the Portuguese government of harming a 12th-century convent while filming in the country. Gilliam has denied the charges, writing on Facebook that he showed respect for the building and “people should begin by getting the facts before howling hysterically.” But under the auspices of Amazon Studios, the film now has a solid release year, 2018, nearly two decades late. In the director’s words, QUIXOTE VIVE!"
ARTS & CULTURE,A 'Harry Potter' Superfan And A NASA Engineer Are Creating A Real 'Leaky Cauldron',"A pub seemingly operating on pure magic may be coming soon to some tucked-away spot on a London street ― but only if enough muggles pay attention to its founder’s bid for funding. Self-proclaimed book nerd Matthew Cortland, with help from NASA engineer friend Travis Davis, aims to create an enchanted atmosphere at The Cauldron Wizarding Pub & Inn dotted with floating candles. Pint glasses will fill mysteriously from the bottom. Lights and taps will go on and off with a flick of a wand. Pictures won’t stay still in their frames. The project almost shares a name with The Leaky Cauldron, the pub on Charing Cross Road that appears to non-wizarding folk as a dusty old shop. Due to licensing issues, it will need to avoid explicitly using the name “Harry Potter” or other direct references to the series.  The $500,000 fundraiser, however, goes live on Kickstarter beginning June 26, the day Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone was published in 1997. The “inn” portion of The Cauldron Wizarding Pub & Inn will also be contingent on the final amount raised. As it should be, creating a pub is the founder’s Priority No. 1.  Cortland told HuffPost in an email that he’ll draw inspiration from an array of magical worlds brought to life in novels by J.K. Rowling, J.R.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis, using smart home technology to make it happen. Magnets, for example, can explain the candles. (We’re still iffy, though, on what explains magnets.)  He also plans to host a series of hackathon events to “refine” the pub’s technology ― and also to figure out what, exactly, to serve. A house beer dubbed Cauldron Ale will be sourced from a local brewer, Cortland said, and fans are also free to make other serving suggestions through a wiki page. Butterbeer, unfortunately, is likely off-limits due to licensing.   As a former teacher, Cortland said he aims to open up The Cauldron to school groups in order to encourage an interest in S.T.E.M. subjects ― and foster an appreciation for literature. In perhaps the best homage to the pub’s source material, the place will also be lined with books, with visitors encouraged to bring a copy of their own favorite childhood story. Cortland has partnered with the Harry Potter Alliance’s “Accio Books” campaign to donate those books to schools. The New Jersey native, who now lives in Dublin, noted that London is the perfect place for the fantastical project since so many beloved works in the genre pull aesthetically from the city. The pub itself will be modeled after one of his real-life favorites ― John Kavanagh in Dublin, the pub alongside Glasnevin Cemetery known locally as “Gravediggers.” “It’s been around since 1833 and is a traditional old-man pub with scrubbed wooden floors, sturdy tables, a cozy atmosphere and excellent Guinness,” Cortland wrote, noting that The Cauldron, in London, would also draw from traditional British pubs. “We just want The Cauldron to be a place of community for the extended fandom, and we will host book signings, book readings, meet-ups, pub trivia nights, fundraisers and movie nights,” he wrote. “Basically we want to be a place of meeting and happiness, and as one of the world’s great cities, London is perfect.” For more information, head to The Cauldron’s website. From June 1 to 30, HuffPost is celebrating the 20th anniversary of the very first “Harry Potter” book by reminiscing about all things Hogwarts. Accio childhood memories."
ARTS & CULTURE,"Funny Or Die Cut Trump Into 'Handmaid's Tale,' And He Fits In Perfectly","This was inevitable. Maybe even unnecessary. But Funny or Die, master of mashups, did it anyway. The humorous site took “The Handmaid’s Tale” ― the Hulu adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s 1985 novel, which has consistently portrayed a reproductive rights hell with too many parallels to present-day American life ― and gave the show a character it doesn’t need: Commander Donald Trump.  Does Gilead’s version of Trump respect women more than anyone? Yes. Does he believe they should be punished for acting as if they are in charge of their own bodies? Yes. So, you know, he’s exactly the same as our Trump. Under His eye."
ARTS & CULTURE,Bob Dylan Finally Gave His Required Nobel Prize Lecture. Here It Is.,"“Bob Dylan” the public artist is a cryptic puzzle. As some scholars may spend years piecing together an understanding of dead languages or obsolete technologies, those with similar Don Quixote-esque tendencies may try to parse a true meaning from Dylan’s art. Dylan has a reputation for being media averse and any long statement from the now 76-year-old artist is rare. So, it’s a unique opportunity that there’s a new, nearly half-hour speech by Dylan to consume. Last year, Dylan was awarded the 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature “for having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition,” as the institution described. At first, Dylan hesitated to accept, but finally allowed the institution to give him his medal earlier this year, albeit in a private ceremony. Part of the requirement of accepting this prize, however, is to give a lecture for The Nobel Foundation. Dylan therefore recorded an audio-only lecture Sunday that was subsequently released Monday. “When I received the Nobel Prize for Literature, I got to wondering exactly how my songs related to literature,” Dylan began his lecture. “I wanted to reflect on it and see where the connection was. I’m going to try to articulate that to you ― and most likely it will go in a round-about way.” Dylan famously didn’t even acknowledge the award for nearly two weeks, a slight that a member of the Nobel institution called “impolite and arrogant.” He also did not attend the formal banquet. Eventually, Dylan warmed to the honor and told The Telegraph that it was “amazing” and “incredible.” He further said, “Who dreams about something like that?” This new lecture at least has the audio flourishes of background music and editing to distinguish it slightly from a straight, rambling recording of Dylan speaking into a microphone. Although the latter wouldn’t have been too surprising (or unwelcome) given Dylan’s artistic history. Dylan finished his intro to the speech by saying, “I hope what I say will be worthwhile and purposeful.”"
ARTS & CULTURE,Margaret Atwood Speaks Out Against Anti-Abortion Legislation In The U.S.,"Since her classic 1985 novel The Handmaid’s Tale was adapted into a TV series for Hulu, Margaret Atwood has used the story as a jumping-off point for discussion around current events.  In a recent call for more public library funding, Atwood reminded fans there are no libraries in Gilead, her fictional authoritarian regime. (“It’s no coincidence,” she added.) Atwood noted that a free press was not protected in Gilead, either, in a letter distributed by PEN America earlier this year regarding censorship and free expression. Most recently, the author brought up Gilead at New York City’s BookCon 2017 this past weekend, likening recent abortion legislation in Texas to “a form of slavery.” Atwood spoke on a panel alongside “The Handmaid’s Tale” showrunner Bruce Miller, discussing the historical precedents for Gilead and the intersection of their art and activism. “I’m not a real activist,” Atwood explained, because activists get paid for their work, and she, on the other hand, doesn’t “have a job.” Her perch as an artist, she continued, makes it possible for her to say the things that others want to say, but feel unable to. For this reason, she said, she would never survive a fascist society because artists are usually targeted first. “So, you are not yet living in a fascist society,” Atwood told BookCon crowds. “Whoopee.” When the panel opened up to audience questions, Atwood was asked to put her speculative fiction abilities to use to predict what’s in store for the United States.  “I’m not a clairvoyant,” Atwood said. Instead, she said she looks at what’s happened in the past ― and what’s happening in the present ― when creating future, fictional worlds.  “I was born in 1939,” she said. “What was going on in 1939?”  Atwood continued to explain that she’s read a great deal about fascism, and is an avid reader of prisoners’ diaries. In fact, when asked what further reading she would recommend to fans of her book, she suggested The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: a History of Nazi Germany by William L. Shirer.  So, The Handmaid’s Tale arose from her imagining what fascism would look like in America. “It wouldn’t be atheistic,” she said.  While she didn’t feel qualified to comment on America’s possible future, she did provide a lengthy, impassioned comment on the current state of affairs ― regarding a question about abortion legislation in Texas.  “I’m [...] waiting for a lawsuit that says if you force me to have children I cannot afford, you should pay for the process,” she said. “It is really a form of slavery to force women to have children that they cannot afford and then to say that they have to raise them.” Atwood also addressed the ways in which the Hulu adaptation of her book takes seriously the issue of climate change. Pollution and other environmental concerns catalyze the establishment of Gilead in the book, but in the show, the changing climate is more central to the plot.  The update to the show, Atwood said, was made to reflect what’s currently happening in the world. The author cited the example of everyday plastics affecting male fertility.  “But you’re not allowed to say that,” she noted. Fans of The Handmaid’s Tale ― both the book and the TV show ― will know that her comments fit with the world Atwood wrote about. In her fictional Gilead, women bear the burden of society’s fertility issues, while male infertility is either ignored or dealt with in secrecy. That Atwood ensured her story was drawn from events and trends already existing in real life makes her vision of a possible future that much more frightening.   Editor’s note: The author of this article moderated the BookCon panel featuring Margaret Atwood and Bruce Miller."
ARTS & CULTURE,"The Creative Process Is A Healing One; '_____,' An Opera","Off and on for the past year I have been working with Ethelyn Friend and a company of artists on an inimitable piece of art called ""_____"", An Opera.  It is an Opera that is improvised, meaning that the music is created on the spot by pianist Gary Grundei and the ensemble of performers every night. To see the performance is to witness the creative process first hand.  In addition to the improvised musical score there are sections of the show called ""Windows"", during which the protagonist, the Writer, literally roles a dice deciding by chance the character, the song and the quality with which it will be sung. The Opera takes place in a small Victorian House, which allows no more than 16 viewers a night. It feels like your very own personal performance. Each audience member is given a small origami box with tiny gifts inside including a bell, a flashlight, ear plugs and a candle along with a special program. Audience members are encouraged to interact and contribute to the performance through the use of their bell and flashlight. They can ring for a moment of stillness, of mindfulness or they can shine a light on whatever they choose. Yet, the truly breathtaking aspect of this show goes beyond its experimentation. The works greatest gift lies in the story itself, based on real events, which reveals the creative process as a healing one. The story is about an artist, a woman, the Writer, who is in the midst of writing an Opera. The audience watches while the Writer discovers her creation as it unfolds. In the vein of Jungian archetypes, the characters she imagines into being are the various aspects of herself. Theres her innocent child-self, her highest self/the all loving and all accepting divinity within, the part that is broken/ostracized/unloved/forced into shadow, the ego maniac, the often blinded and silenced consciousness who bears witness to it all. As the story unfolds The Writer is confronted with the traumatic memory of childhood incest. The story she is writing begins to unearth what has long been buried. At first she is in denial. She tries to ""delete"" this part of her story. When the characters begin to reveal the truth she tells them ""not yet"", in an attempt to prolong the inevitable. For a time the Writer's tactics of interruption, procrastination, and distraction are successful. However, eventually the truth can no longer be avoided. All her parts begin to coalesce, joining forces and each raising their voices in an attempt to shine light on this shadow. Through her own divine wisdom and fearlessness she opens herself to her full, unedited, unsuppressed story. She finds herself face to face with her buried suffering, looking directly into the  darkest part of herself. She sees for the first time how she has become frozen and stuck, unable to move forward by the unprocessed trauma of her past. She allows the shadow to step into the light and places it in the warm and clear seeing embrace of loving-kindess. She creates space in which her shadowed trauma can be expressed and reborn. So much of the healing process within the performance is expressed through the voice. With an ensemble or performers steeped in Roy Hart vocal training, the piece expresses the voice as the muscle of the soul and does not shy away from its darkest parts. As the shadow is revealed, the voices of the ensemble sonically convey the messy heights and depths, the lightness and darkness of what it is to be human. An ""Aria of Broken Sounds"" follows a song exclaiming the intensity and richness of human suffering, ""Soul at the White Heat"". The piece travels from gorgeous operatic and sing song tones to the shredded, powerfully raw voices that culturally we are taught to suppress and silence just like our beautiful shadows. To say that working on this piece has changed my life is not an overstatement. Living inside of this story for over a year and performing it night after night undoubtedly has had an effect on me personally. I imagine the same can be said of my incredible collaborators, although I will not speak for them. Unknowingly at first, and then very clearly, I found myself working with my own shadow, my broken bits that I shove to the side wishing they would go away. Through this process I have begun to viscerally perceive how all my parts, the divine and the painfully ugly have a place within me. Before each rehearsal and every show we had a routine of reading random excerpts from the works of Pema Chödrön. She reminded us nearly every day that our main challenge in being human is to come to know and befriend ourselves, all parts of ourselves without discrimination. The Roy Hart practice too, teaches of the equanimity of all sounds, the high, the low, the beautiful and the ugly. If all sounds arise from the soul then all sounds must be treated equally. Healing and personal transformation begin with awareness and integration. This is what this piece has been teaching me. And from what our audiences have shared, the piece has offered more than any of us could have ever imagined. I am forever grateful to this creative process and those who bravely led the way on this incredible journey. While ""________"", An Opera is up and running and has had an entirely sold out run, we are still trying to raise funds. Our intention is to continue sharing this deeply moving work with many more audiences beyond this 3 week run. Please consider donating to the Indiegogo campaign. We only have till midnight tonight to reach our goal and we are currently only at 66%.  Thank you and many blessings. Libretto by Ethelyn Friend, Music live-improvised by Gary Grundei with Ensemble  Directed by Erica Terpening-Romeo  With Allison Caw  Jessica Cerullo  Barrett Ogden"
ARTS & CULTURE,Lawsuit Accuses Glass Artist Dale Chihuly Of Plagiarizing Work,"A lawsuit filed on Friday accuses the renowned Washington glass artist Dale Chihuly of passing off the work of another man as his own for 15 years. The suit, filed by the lawyers of Michael Moi in King County Superior Court and the U.S. District Court for Western Washington, claims the prolific decorator of botanical gardens has been involved in a “myriad of clandestine painting sessions” with Moi, but has never compensated him or given him credit for his efforts, despite the artist’s promises otherwise. “The truth behind the creation of his paintings has been intentionally hidden,” Moi claims. In a press release sent to HuffPost, Chihuly’s camp strongly refutes Moi’s claims, dubbing the lawsuit “baseless.”  The statement, sent on Friday from Chihuly’s studio headquarters in Seattle, claims the studio hired Moi as handyman for “various cleaning, repairing and small construction projects over the years.” Moi “also alleges possession of Chihuly’s private documents, including medical papers and personal letters, that would be ‘substantively uncomfortable’ if released to the public,” the statement adds. In February, the statement continues, Moi asked for $21 million, “threatening to publicly file a lawsuit if his demand for money was not met. Earlier this month, when Chihuly had not agreed to pay him, Moi served Chihuly’s legal counsel with a state court complaint.” Chihuly Inc. asserts that it has “allowed” Moi’s claims to go public “rather than accede to Mr. Moi’s ultimatum,” characterizing the demands as “nothing more than an ugly and reprehensible display of opportunism and exploitation” motivated by a desire to disclose private information, specifically about Chihuly’s mental health, a topic of a recent Associated Press interview. Chihuly told the AP he has been dealing with bouts of depression since his 20s, and, at 75 years old, suffers from bipolar disorder. “I’m usually either up or down,” he said. “I don’t have neutral very much. When I’m up I’m usually working on several projects. A lot of times it’s about a six-month period. When I’m down, I kind of go in hibernation.” Moi’s lawsuit demands credit for joint work ― “a large volume of paintings” he says were created at Chihuly’s Boathouse in Washington, some involving blow torches and plexiglass ― as well as the revenues derived from their sale. Moi never held the position of painting assistant, the company counters, while acknowledging that Chihuly does not work alone ― he uses studio assistants to “execute his vision,” particularly his large, glass-blown sculptures that often resemble alien sea creatures or Seussian shrubbery. (A few anonymous reviewers of Chihuly Studio on Glassdoor claim to have experienced a less-than-ideal working environment.) Chihuly has been a part of court cases concerning his art before. In 2006, he sued two fellow glass-blowers, one of whom was a longtime collaborator, for copyright infringement, claiming they had purposefully mimicked his signature style. (The case against one of them, Bryan Rubino, was settled.) Chihuly’s work is currently on view in shows at the New York Botanical Garden, as well as Arkansas’ Crystal Bridges museum. It’s also included in more permanent displays in venues across the country."
ARTS & CULTURE,Writers' Group Is Raising Money To Send Girls To See 'Wonder Woman',"Diana Prince may be a fictional superhero, battling enemies with her Lasso of Truth, but her story has also had a heroic impact on the film industry. With this week’s release of “Wonder Woman,” director Patty Jenkins became the first woman to helm a big-budget superhero flick. If it’s a critical and box office success, the feat will likely open doors for other woman filmmakers, too. So, the movie is a boon for women working behind the camera ― but its also a step in the right direction for how women are portrayed on camera too. Jenkins’ Wonder Woman is tough and gracious, self-possessed and physically agile. She’d make a great role model for young girls, which is why nonprofit organization Girls Inc. is raising funds to send 70 high-school-aged women in New York City to see the film. “Wonder Woman has been a cultural icon since her creation in 1942, and symbol to girls and boys that a woman can be strong, bold, and compassionate,” the organization writes on its GoFundMe page.  The aim of Girls Inc., headquartered in NYC, is to provide young women with resources to succeed academically, and to participate in physical activities. The group also hopes to help women “manage money” and “navigate media messages.” The effort to raise money to send girls to see “Wonder Woman” is co-led by Legion of Women Writers, a network of women working in media and entertainment. Their GoFundMe campaign has already exceeded its initial fundraising goal of $1,200 and, as of Friday morning, surpassed its stretch goal of $5,000, too. According to an update on the campaign, the additional money will go to Girls Inc. of NYC’s Annual College Shower, which helps freshman girls pay for college costs."
ARTS & CULTURE,9 Other Superheroines Who Deserve Their Own Movie Adaptations,"This week, director Patty Jenkins made history. She became the first woman director to head up a summer blockbuster ― a big-budget sector of the film industry typically reserved for action movies directed by men. That Hollywood has been notoriously unkind to women directors makes the feat more remarkable still. Jenkins ― whose biggest flick prior to “Wonder Woman” was made with less than a tenth of the budget ― is only the fourth woman director to head up a project in the $100 million plus range. What’s more: critics say the film’s a hit. In an interview with Hollywood Reporter, Jenkins was modest about her early success. “I can’t take on the history of 50 percent of the population just because I’m a woman,” she said. And we agree. There’s no dearth of talented women directors who haven’t been given a chance on big-budget projects; hopefully, Jenkins’ efforts will open doors for them, too. We’ve got a few in mind. Between Marvel’s “She-Hulk” and DC Comics’ brainy Natasha Irons, there are dozens of superheroine stories waiting to be adapted into summertime hits. Below, we’ve paired our favorite women directors with the winningest heroes we love. In recent Marvel installments of her story, “She-Hulk” has become much more than an object of desire. Mariko Tamaki — author of “This One Summer” — gives Jennifer Walters her own story, in which she’s coping with PTSD. And Karyn Kusama — director of “Girlfight” and “Jennifer’s Body” — has proven that she’s able to take on action-centered stories with dark psychological underpinnings. Elisabeth Olsen is currently playing the Scarlet Witch, aka Wanda Maximoff, in the “Avengers” movies, beginning with “Age of Ultron.” Maximoff is (maybe) the daughter of Magneto, the twin sister of Quicksilver, and her husband is Vision, so a film centered specifically on Scarlet Witch ― whose powers include being able to alter reality in various ways ― would be a true comic book family drama. We’d like to see Reed Morano, the director of the first three episodes of Hulu’s “The Handmaid’s Tale” as well as films like “Skeleton Twins,” give the adaptation a bleak, intimate edge. Raven is a half-human, half-demon superhero who was rejected by the Justice League due to her dangerous ancestry. She winds up forming her own group of rowdy do-gooder teens ― a story that seems suited to Amber Tamblyn’s penchant for dark and feeling character studies. Faith, with her psychokinetic and telepathic powers, has earned praise as a body-positive superheroine who, according to writer Amy Diegelman, is “fat [...] and not hiding.” In her solo comic, Faith (aka Zephyr) has a boring job at a BuzzFeed-like media company, is dealing with a breakup and is living in a new city ― the perfectly relatable millennial scenario. Amma Asante, who directed 2016’s “A United Kingdom,” could bring out the best of this story. Geeks everywhere already know that DuVernay is behind the promising new adaptation of “A Wrinkle in Time,” so she’s already established herself as a woman director who’s interested in fantastical stories. DuVernay could work her magic on any of the Marvel of DC characters, really, but a cinematic retelling of Natasha Irons’ story would be worthy of her talents. Irons — like Tony Stark and her uncle, Steel — begins her world-saving career as an engineer donning Steel’s powerful suit.  Maybe you don’t want a “Poison Ivy” remake, but we do. And who better to make it happen than Dee Rees? She’s known for directing the HBO film “Bessie,” the docuseries “When We Rise” and an episode of “Empire,” but is tied to the “Philip K. Dick’s Electric Dreams” Amazon project, giving her some sci-fi experience. In the comic books, Poison Ivy ― or Pamela Lillian Isley ― is a botanist-turned-eco-terrorist (and sometimes Batman love interest), which seems like a complex villain plot built for our post-Paris Accord era.   Barring her uncreative name, Thor Girl (née Tarene) is a full-fledged superhero deserving of her own flick. After fighting supervillain Loki alongside Thor, she sought refuge on earth under the alias Tara Olson. Mimi Leder, the director of “Deep Impact” and executive producer on “The Leftovers,” would be a suitable match for Tarene. “Buffy” would make for another contentious remake, but one that, under the helm of “American Honey” director Andrea Arnold, could be incredible. We’d love to see a film adaptation focus more on the mundane struggles of a high schooler living in suburban California ― which also happens to a “Hellmouth,” opening up Buffy’s home to a demonic gateway.  Echo, aka Ronin, made her first appearance in “Daredevil” Vol. 2, Issue #9, as a Native American woman with gifted intellect and “photographic reflexes,” who also happens to be one of the first deaf comic book characters. Her biography could move in so many directions ― she’s been in love with Daredevil, friends with Wolverine and Dr. Strange, allied with the New Avengers. Heather Rae, who’s mostly directed documentaries (like the Sundance and Tribeca darling “Trudell,” which tells the story of historic Native American poet and activist John Trudell), has experience working on narrative films as a producer. We’d love to see what someone with her resume could do with a superhero flick. CORRECTION: A previous version of this article included an image of “Thor Goddess of Thunder” (Jane Foster), instead of “Thor Girl” (Tarene Olson). It also incorrectly described the plot of “Belle,” Amma Asante’s film. "
ARTS & CULTURE,"Unclear Language Isn't Just Annoying, It's Politically Dangerous","They’re around every corner, frighteningly vacant shells of what they once were. What renowned editor Harold Evans calls “zombies” ― or, words that have lost their vitality ― are spotted often amid unclear writing. And, according to Evans, they’re muddying up our language to the point of total opacity.  Evans’ new book, Do I Make Myself Clear?, is a case for the value of clear writing, and a thorough guide for making writing clearer.  “One of the reasons we get tired in writing and in studying, is we have to carry all this dross in our heads. All this excess wordage,” Evans told HuffPost in a phone interview.  A statement like that might be dismissed as pedantry, but Evans’ professional experiences more than qualify him for making such a claim. He was the longstanding editor of The Sunday Times, and has since held positions at The Atlantic Monthly and New York Daily News. Before that, he worked in India and Northern England, where he endeavored to use straightforward, evocative language to communicate directly to papers’ readerships.  In the 1980s, Evans moved to the U.S., where he founded Conde Nast Traveler and later served as the publisher of Random House. These roles inspired him to hone another title on his resume: author of instructional writing books. “There was no economy in the writing, there was no conciseness,” Evans said. “My metaphor for it was, while the English are still on the starvation diet of WWII ― which we were, because all the newspapers shrank in size, and had to be very economical ― Americans grazed gently over acres of pasture.” In Do I Make Myself Clear?, Evans ventures to change that. He identifies the worst offenders of verbose, inexpressive writing. “Academia is one of the major criminals,” he said. “The major criminals are lawyers, academics, bureaucrats of all kinds, insurance companies.”  Politicians, of course, are among the guilty. Evans points out Trump’s unclear language, and the power it has to mask the decisions being made by his administration. With his book, Evans is interested in alerting readers to “the deceptions practiced on us. For instance, in the health care bill going through Congress at the moment, the deceptions in the language are serious.”  To this end, Evans points out several easily identifiable offenses. The aforementioned zombies, or verbs that are used as nouns, are one. For example, rather than, “I authorized the expenditure,” a zombiefied version would read, “the authorization of the expenditure was approved.” “The verb is being turned into a flabby noun,” Evans said.  Another impediment to clarity: pleonasms, or extra words. The example Evans gives is “35 acres of land”; “of land” is an unnecessary add-on. “American newspapers and online are full of pleonasms, some of which are funny,” Evans said.  And another: flesh-eaters, or, as Evans puts it, “words [or phrases] without any meaning whatsoever.” In his book, he lists pages’ worth of examples, and translations into clearer iterations of the words. So, “currently” becomes “now,” “adjacent to” becomes “near,” “due to the fact that” becomes “because,” “in order to” becomes “to,” and “this day and age” becomes, simply, “today.”  Today, Evans’ ode to clarity is much needed. As he argues in his book, murky descriptors make it harder for readers to see the truth behind a tweet, a treatise, or a proposed new law.  Do I Make Myself Clear? is available now."
ARTS & CULTURE,Alanis Morissette’s 'Jagged Little Pill' Is Getting Turned Into A Musical,"You oughta know that your favorite ‘90s woman rocker is headed for the theatre.

According to a press release, Cody and Morissette are basing the musical’s story on “a modern and multi-generational family and their complex dynamics, touching on issues of gender identity and race.” “The chemistry between all of us is crackling and I feel honored to be diving into these songs again,” Morissette said in a statement. And yes, hits like “Ironic” and “Hand in My Pocket” will be worked into the musical, which will premiere May 2018 in Cambridge, Massachusetts."
ARTS & CULTURE,"The Bachelorette Told A Cheating Bro To GTFO, And It Was Glorious","Bachelorette Rachel Lindsay had to get no-nonsense with a contestant on Monday night, after Episode 2 of Season 13 revealed one suitor had been hiding a girlfriend. Teasers made clear that the episode’s final date, a group outing to play basketball with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, would turn dramatic for all the wrong reasons when a young woman showed up claiming one of the bachelors had been dating her until his departure ― and never broke up with her. The cad turns out to be DeMario, a contestant who first appeared on “After the Final Rose” suggesting that he and Rachel elope to Vegas on the spot. The woman who crashed the episode claimed he dated her for seven months, then simply stopped texting her three days before he met Rachel on the “ATFR” special. “He still has keys to my place,” she told the shocked Bachelorette. Many viewers have been watching DeMario skeptically after Rachel’s friend Whitney Fransway, a fellow “Bachelor” alum, warned her on the premiere that the gentleman might not have the best intentions. But Rachel seemed torn between skepticism at his cockiness and attraction to his clever references and serious good looks. Once his ex showed up on the scene, however, Rachel was all business. Like a good attorney, she gave DeMario a chance to defend himself as he proceeded to destroy his own case. First pretending to have never met the woman, he then admitted they’d been involved. He denied ever having had keys to her place, then admitted he did ― but claimed to have mailed them back to her. (His ex hilariously shot down this claim, retorting, “I check my mailbox EVERY DAY!”)  “I’m not here to get played,” Rachel finally snapped. “So I’m gonna need you to get the fuck out.” And with that, DeMario’s stint on “The Bachelorette” came to a humiliating end ― or did it? The episode ends with a cliffhanger, as he returns to the mansion to interrupt the cocktail party and plead his case. It’s tough to imagine this womanizer getting another shot after Rachel’s tough-but-fair dismissal. But no matter what happens, we’ll always have that truly iconic send-off.

ARTS & CULTURE,Being Convinced We're Always Right Is Our Next National Emergency,"It’s no secret that we’ve reached the apex of the the age of entitlement. Social media and political polarization have pushed people on either side of the spectrum to dig in their heels and refuse the other side. We’ve come to value being right more than being humble. It’s not about the pursuit of knowledge anymore. No, it’s the pursuit of self-validation. There have already been numerous articles on how self-fulfilling bubbles eventually lead to a crisis in knowledge. These bubbles emerge as a result of people filtering their social media of any information that disagrees with their values. Instead of consuming a healthy diet of opposing viewpoints, we become an ouroboros consuming our own tail just to feel better about ourselves. American social psychologist Jonathan Haidt believes this confirmation bias on the internet is our next national emergency. In this new video from The RSA, Haidt cautions that this influx of self-fulfilling information can only be combatted by teaching humility and acceptance in grade schools. By creating a more organic understanding and consumption of information on both sides we become a more tolerant and accepting society that can push forward into the future. Or, you know, we don’t and we’re all doomed to die thinking we’re right."
ARTS & CULTURE,Minnesota Museum To Remove Gallows Exhibit After Native American Protest,"The Walker Art Center in Minneapolis has agreed to remove a controversial outdoor “gallows” sculpture following protests by local Native Americans. The large work includes design elements of seven different historical U.S. gallows, including one used to hang 38 Dakota Indians in the state in 1862. “I regret the pain that this artwork has brought to the Dakota community and others,” museum executive director Olga Viso said in a statement announcing the decision that was posted on Facebook Saturday. “This is the first step in a long process of healing.” Walker Art director apologizes, regrets not involving American Indians in new sculpture acquisition, ""Scaffold."" https://t.co/LETqMFuLJo pic.twitter.com/NWJQkmUWd4 The two-story structure entitled “Scaffold,” created in 2012 by Los Angeles artist Sam Durant and inspired by a dark history of American hangings, was intended as a criticism of capital punishment. But many in the local community considered it insensitive. The hanging of the “Dakota 38” after the U.S.-Dakota War in Minnesota was the largest state-sanctioned mass execution in U.S. history. The artist now supports dismantling his exhibit, Viso’s statement said, and has told the museum’s executive director: “It’s just wood and metal ― nothing compared to the lives and histories of the Dakota people.” Not our proudest moment. #walkerartcenter #minneapolissculpturegarden #scaffold #takeitdown https://t.co/lWfqvXgk0p pic.twitter.com/bloCF51I2W “I am in agreement with the artist that the best way to move forward is to have Scaffold dismantled in some manner and to listen and learn from the elders,” she added. Viso said she had hoped the choice of the work would trigger a valuable dialogue and increased awareness about capital punishment and violence. “I regret that I did not better anticipate how the work would be received in Minnesota, especially by Native audiences. I should have engaged leaders in the Dakota and broader Native communities in advance of the work’s siting,” she wrote in an open letter last week. The details of how the work will be dismantled will be determined in meetings this week with tribal elders. The large work ― with steps for visitors to climb to the gallows ― was to be one of 18 new works in a renovated Minneapolis Sculpture Garden at the Walker Art Center to be unveiled June 3. Protesters on the scene applauded the decision when it was announced, but many plan to camp out at the space until the exhibit is removed. And anger has still been running high, with some on the scene brandishing signs reading: “This isn’t art; this is murder.” James Cross, who identifies as Anishinaabe and Dakota, told the Pioneer Press that the decision to erect the scaffold without any input from the Native American community was a “slap in the face.”  “Scaffold” was praised by critics when it was shown in 2012 in Germany and in Scotland."
ARTS & CULTURE,Director John Scheinfeld On The Spiritual Journey Of Jazz Icon John Coltrane,"In this week’s episode of “Scheer Intelligence” Robert Scheer speaks with documentarian John Scheinfeld about his latest film, “Chasing Trane” about jazz icon John Coltrane. The two also discuss Scheinfeld’s earlier film,  “The U.S. vs. John Lennon,” and Lennon’s political activism during the Vietnam War. The conversation begins with a look at the parallels between Lennon and Coltrane. Noting that the two music legends “overlapped in time,” Scheer tells Scheinfeld: “What you capture in both stories is a search for integrity and rebellion.” After delving into Lennon’s political activism during and after the Vietnam War, the two discuss Coltrane’s legacy. Scheinfeld notes that Coltrane was a “practice nut” who would practice “hours and hours every day.” “Yes, jazz exists today, but it’s not the same thing,” Scheer says. Scheinfeld explains Coltrane’s background and musical process, and the two agree that his music defied any genre. “He seemed to always be learning and seeking the truth,” Scheinfeld says. “I didn’t want to make a jazz film. In fact, I think the word ‘jazz’ appears in ‘Chasing Trane’ maybe five times. This is a journey film ... it’s a portrait of this remarkable artist.” Listen to the full conversation and listen to past editions of “Scheer Intelligence” here.  — Adapted from Truthdig.com"
ARTS & CULTURE,"Denis Johnson, Acclaimed Author Of 'Jesus' Son,' Dead At 67","Writer Denis Johnson, the author of the modern classic short story collection Jesus’ Son and National Book Award-winning novel Tree of Smoke, died on Thursday at 67. His death was confirmed to the Associated Press by Jonathan Galassi, president of Johnson’s longtime publisher, Farrar, Straus & Giroux. Fellow writer and friend Chris Offutt also confirmed on Twitter, noting that Johnson was “at home, peaceful” when he died.  Johnson was best-known for his 1992 Jesus’ Son, a collection of linked short stories set in a gritty realm of drug addiction, violence, and casual destruction. The stories, narrated by a young drifter named Fuckhead, drew attention for the stylishly jumbled narratives and neon-bright prose. The collection was adapted into a 1999 film starring Billy Crudup. His 2007 novel Tree of Smoke, a hefty book about CIA operations in Vietnam during the war, won the National Book Award and was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize. His novella Train Dreams, first published in the Paris Review in 2002, came out as a book for the first time in 2011. It was shortlisted for the 2012 Pulitzer Prize, but the fiction prize that year went, controversially, unawarded.  Johnson’s body of work ran far deeper than his most famous titles, however; he penned plays, poetry collections, screenplays, journalistic works, and numerous novels. His last novel, The Laughing Monsters, came out in 2014 and received comparatively unenthusiastic reviews. HuffPost deemed the book, a brooding spy caper set in Sierre Leone, “a compelling read” constructed of “stripped-down, evocative prose,” yet “disappointingly underbaked.”  A powerful inspiration to many American writers, Johnson’s reputation amongst the literati has never faded. His distinctive, arresting style and capacity for human insight can be found in stories like “Car Crash While Hitchhiking,” “Happy Hour,” and “Emergency,” and in his ongoing influence on contemporary fiction writers."
ARTS & CULTURE,Donald Trump Gave The Pope A Sculpture His Holiness Will Probably Regift,"Turns out President Donald Trump’s taste in art is just about as refined as his taste in suits. During Wednesday’s visit to the Vatican, 45 exchanged gifts with a dour looking Pope Francis. His holiness’ awesomely unsubtle gifts to our president included the pontiff’s 2015 treatise on climate change along with a large medallion reading, “I give this to you so that you can be an instrument of peace.”  Trump, in return, gifted the Pope with a bronze sculpture of lotus flowers that just screams dentist waiting room. Seriously, the seafoam green figure makes Dale Chihuly seem like Auguste Rodin.  The piece, called “Rising Above,” is the work of Florida-based artist Geoffrey C. Smith, whose sculptures often depict various species of plants and wildlife. “Art is important. It was man’s first form of communication and still one of the most powerful forms today,” Smith quotes himself as saying on his website. Too true. Could Smith possibly let Trump, who’d like little more than to defund the National Endowment for the Arts, know? According to the White House, Trump selected the sculpture because the sacred flower “evokes two universal values: unity and resilience.” In comparison to the Pope’s pointed presents, however, the floral arrangement seems to evoke the universal value of sleepiness. (From which Trump is probably suffering.) It’s hard to gauge exactly what Pope Francis is thinking in the photo below, though we wouldn’t be surprised if a good friend of the Holy Father’s winds up with something very similar to the lotus sculpture come Christmas time.  H/T artnet News."
ARTS & CULTURE,Evan Pricco Curates 'What In The World' At Urban Nation In Berlin,"A new exhibition in Berlin’s neighborhood of Schöneberg epitomizes one of the central schisms that has vibrated through Street Art and graffiti for years: the question of where to draw boundaries between these two scenes. Each may have been born in the margins of society but are now evermore commingled. Debates aside, everyone agrees that once in the gallery space, street become fine art after all. “The graffiti and Street Art movements – they have all these tentacles and they can be non-linear,” Evan says as we walk down a subterranean parking ramp to see a low, long outdoor mural by Sweden’s EKTA; an abstract series of roughly square patches that closely emulate the sewn panels he has suspended from the ceiling inside the gallery. As Editor-in-Chief of the San Francisco based art magazine Juxtapoz and curator of this “What in the World” show at Urban Nation’s project space, Evan Pricco is well aware of the landmines that can explode when one is negotiating the terminologies and practices of sundry sub-cultural art manifestations that have bubbled to the surface in the last decades and which now often melt with one another inextricably. “The graffiti and Street Art movements – they have all these tentacles and they can be non-linear,” Evan says as we walk down a subterranean parking ramp to see a low, long outdoor mural by Sweden’s EKTA; an abstract series of roughly square patches that closely emulate the sewn panels he has suspended from the ceiling inside the gallery. Speaking of the tentacles, he continues, “It can be starting points to end points – it can be end points to starting points. There are all of these different cultures that grew out of that 1970s-80s set of counter-culture art movements. “I think the people that I really wanted in this show are kind of on the periphery of that. They clearly dip their toe into those movements, are clearly influenced by them. Their practice doesn’t necessarily fit in with what is going on in Street Art and graffiti but also its informed by it.” To introduce a new crop of artists to Urban Nation that haven’t been shown here yet, Pricco choses some of Europes street/mural/conceptual artists who emphasize color and mood, an expansionist approach that he welcomes at the magazine as well. Not surprisingly, the range reflects some of the same interests you’ll find flipping through the influential art publication; old school graffiti, commercial illustration, comic book history, abstract fine art, political art, some lowbrow, some conceptual. There is even Grotesk’s newsstand, the actual one that he designed and constructed with Juxtapoz that sat in Times Square in October 2015. Primarily from Europe and raised in the hothouse of the 1990s epic graffiti scenes that enthralled youth in many EU big cities, this group of 7 artists each has moved their practice forward – which may lose them some street cred and gather new audiences. Included are Berlin’s Daan Botlek,  Sweden’s EKTA, Ermsy from France, Erosie from the Netherlands, Hyuro  from Spain, Serge Lowrider from Switzerland and Zio Ziegler from the US.  If you speak to any of them, you may find the commonality is the  freedom they actively give themselves to pursue an autonomous artistic  route not easily categorized. Lowrider is clearly in love with the letter-form, as is the graffiti tradition, but he steers sharply toward the calligraphic practices of crisp sign-painting and inverting the pleasantly banal messaging of advertising from an earlier era. Perhaps the tight line work overlaps with tattoo and skater culture, two creative brethren frequently in the mix in graffiti and Street Art scenes. Hyuro uses a figurative symbolism heavy with metaphor and a color palette that is too understated for the flashy graphics that many associate with today’s mural festivals, yet she’s built a dedicated following among Street Art fans who admire her poke-you-in-the-eye activist streak. Daan Botleks’ figures wander and cavort amidst an abstractedly shaped world calling to mind the shading of early graffiti and the volumizing pointillism of Seurat after some wine. Painter Jeroen Erosie emphatically will tell you that he was in love with graffiti when he first did it on the streets as a teenager – and for many years afterwards. But he says he ultimately bristled at a scene that had once symbolized freedom to him but had become too rigid and even oppressive in its rules about how aesthetics should be practiced by people – if they were to earn respect within the clan. At Saturday nights opening along Bülowstrasse with the front doors open to the busy street and with the sound of the elevated train swooshing by overhead, Erosie explained with a gleeful certainty his process of deconstruction that led him to this point. “I removed one of the pillars of graffiti  from my work and I liked the result, the change. So I started to remove more pillars, one by one,” he says, describing the evolution that  transformed his letter forms and colors into these simplified and bold  bi-color icons that may call to mind Matisse’s cut outs more than  graffiti bubble-tags, but you’ll easily draw the correlation if you try. The Project M series of exhibitions over the past three years with Urban Nation, of which this is the 12th, have featured curators and artists from many backgrounds, disciplines, and geographies as well. The myriad styles shown have included sculpture, stencil, wheat paste, collage, calligraphy, illustration, screen-printing, decoupage, aerosol, oil painting, and even acrylic brush. It has been a carefully guided selection of graffiti/Street  Art/urban art/fine art across the 12 shows; all presented respectfully cheek to jowl, side by side – happily for some, uncomfortably for others. The  ultimate success of the Project M series, initiated by UN Artistic  Director Yasha Young, is evident in just how far open it has flung the  doors of expectation to the museum itself. When the house opens in four  months it will be a reflection to some extent 140 or so artists who  pushed open those doors with variety of styles emblematic of this moment  - converging into something called Urban Contemporary. “What in the World” indeed: this show is in perfect alignment with the others in its wanton plumbing of the genres. “I was trying to find people that are not part of the regular  circuit – and I don’t mean that in a negative way but I mean there is kind of a regular circuit of muralism and Street Art right now – but I was looking for people who are really sort of on that periphery,” Pricco  says. “Also because they are coming from these different parts of  Europe, which to me sort of represents Juxtpoz’ reach, and they all kind of know each other but they’ve never really met – they all kind of  bounce off of each other.” Brooklyn Street Art: This grouping sounds anathema to the loyalty that is often demanded by these scenes –  particularly the various graffiti scenes in cities around the world. You are describing an artistic practice that has a sort of casual relationship to that scene.  Evan Pricco: Right. And I think all of these artists have these graffiti histories but they weren’t completely satisfied with that kind of moniker or label. So it is slightly expanding out now. And then there’s something about them that makes me think of crafts, especially with Serge who is more of a sign-painter. I felt that all of these people approached their work in a way that felt very craft-oriented to me, and I really appreciated that. That’s kind of what I wanted to show too. Brooklyn Street Art: Each of these artists appears to have a certain familiarity with the art world that is outside a more strict definition of street culture – graffiti and Street Art and their tributaries. Would you say that you could see a certain development of personal style in this collection of primarily European artists that might be due to exposure to formal art history or other cultural influences? Evan Pricco: Good question, and that could be the case for a few of the artists in the show, but I think the  characteristics of each artist in the show is more of a result of the world getting smaller and influences and boundaries just blurring. You can see it Ermsy’s pop-culture mash-ups, or Erosie’s exploration of lettering and color; it’s not really about one place anymore but a larger dialogue of how far the work reaches now than ever before. Erosie and I were having this conversation this morning about this, this idea of access and influences being so widespread. And that is exactly what I wanted to do. “What In the World” is sort of a nod to not really having to have boundaries, or a proper definition, but a feeling that something is happening. Its not Street Art, its not graffiti, but its this new wave that is looking out, looking in, and finding new avenues to share and make work. Brooklyn Street Art: From comic books to politics to activism to abstract to sign painting, this show spans the Hi-Low terrain that Juxtapoz often seeks to embrace in many ways. Is it difficult to find common threads or narratives when countenancing such variety? Evan Pricco: We have been so fortunate with the magazine that we have been able to expand the content in the last few years, and the threads are starting to connect solely based on the idea that the creative life is what you make of it. There may not be a direct  connection between Serge Lowrider and Mark Ryden, but there is a connection in the idea of craftsmanship and skill and how one goes about applying that skill in the art world. That is always wanted I wanted to help bring to Juxtapoz – this idea that variety in the art world is healthy and finds its own connections just in the fact that it exists and is being made. Brooklyn Street Art: Many of these names are not household names, though some have ardent fans within more narrow channels of influence. What role does a curator play by introducing these artworks/artists to a new audience and what connections would you like a viewer to make?  Evan Pricco: First and foremost, these are some of my absolute favorite artists making work right now. I do have the advantage of traveling a lot and meeting different people and seeing  their process, but I really wanted to bring together a group that I hadn’t personally met but admired and communicated with from afar. I was thinking about this when I walked by Hyuro’s wall this morning. Her work is incredibly strong, and it has this really fascinating way of being a story and narrative from wall to wall while  remaining fresh and really site-specific. Her work here just blew me away; its so subtle, has this really unique almost anonymous quality to it, but has a ton of thought and heart in it. Really it would be great if the audience sees this and finds her other work, and starts seeing this really beautiful story emerging, these powerful political, social and economic commentaries. So really, I want that. I want this to be a gateway of looking at work and artists  and then jumping into their really fantastically complex careers. Brooklyn Street Art: Urban Nation has invited curators from around the world and Berlin during these 12 “Project M” shows, each with a take on what “art in the streets” is, how it has evolved, and how it is affecting contemporary art. What makes this show stand out?  Evan Pricco: I really do think what makes it stand out is that it represents all the things Juxtapoz stands for; Opening up an  audience to something new and different. I think there is an aesthetic that the Project M shows have had, which I like, but I didn’t want to repeat what everyone had done before. This is most definitely a Juxtapoz show; I mean our damned Newsstand that Grotesk designed is right in the middle of the space. But that is like this “representation” of the print mag, and all the walls around it  are the avenues the magazine can take you; sign painting, textiles, graffiti, abstraction, conceptual art, murals, comics, politics. … So maybe in that way, the fact that the magazine is 23 years old and has covered such a big history of Lowbrow, Graffiti and other forms of art, this is a nice encapsulation of the next wave and generation. “What In the World: The Juxtapoz Edition” presented by Urban Nation will be on display through June 2017.  ____________________ Please note: All content including images and text are © BrooklynStreetArt.com, unless otherwise noted.

ARTS & CULTURE,The Painful Truth About The Pressures Of Academic Life,"The woman who narrates Weike Wang’s debut novel has stumbled into a quarter-life crisis. A Chinese-American chemistry Ph.D. student, she has always expected (as have her parents) that she would progress from triumph to academic triumph. A top student in high school, she was admitted to a prestigious university and excelled at chemistry.  Now, the time has arrived for her to complete her dissertation research and claim her graduate degree. But that isn’t happening. She labors in the lab for hours, hovering over her experiments like an anxious mother, but the results don’t come. Without results, she can’t complete her research; but she can’t force the results to come. Though maybe she could spend a little more time in the lab, right? Holidays? Weekends? Nights? Would more investment of time help her to perfect her flawed hypotheses? Would a little patience allow her to come naturally to her “eureka” moment?  Her live-in boyfriend, redheaded wunderkind Eric, is a year ahead of her and already fielding job offers from his preferred academic institutions. The creative side of chemistry comes naturally to him. Maybe, he suggests to her, that life just isn’t for her. Maybe she topped out at speedily and proficiently replicating known reactions: She’s a technician. “Who does chemistry think he is, God?” she yells in response. “If I want it to be my thing, it will be my thing.” It’s not the only question she’s avoiding. Eric has proposed to her. “Ask me again tomorrow,” she replies. “That’s not how it works,” he responds. For a while, though, that is how it works ― she goes to the lab, walks their dog, cuddles with him at night, and he waits for her to say yes. She and Eric met in graduate school, and when he eventually told her he loved her, she shut down: “I don’t know what to say. I don’t say anything he wants to hear.” She can only be vulnerable obliquely, by spending time with him, touching him, and, eventually, giving him a burrito with the right words written on the wrapper. Now, with marriage on the table, she is again balking at openly acknowledging the depth of their entanglement.  Nor can she acknowledge that, when it comes to her research, she’s hit an unyielding wall. Instead, one day, she calmly smashes a set of beakers on the floor. She takes a leave from the program. When her parents ask about her progress with her Ph.D., she lies.  In Chemistry, the beleaguered narrator finds herself replaying her relationship with her parents over and over ― with Eric, whose proffered love and commitment make her happy yet uneasy, and with the discipline of chemistry itself, which constantly withholds satisfaction and accolades in a way she finds familiar yet miserable. Her father, who overcame a poor rural background in China to become a successful engineer in America, expects nothing from her but success as a chemist; her mother was often miserable in the marriage, but finds common cause with her husband in relentlessly pushing their daughter to scientific stardom.  This narrator manifests a statistically significant problem. Like many young Asian-American women, she’s crushed beneath the weight of parental expectations. Recent studies have shown that Asian-American women have higher rates of suicidal ideation and attempts, depressed by, among other factors, the overwhelming pressure to succeed. It’s not that simple, though: Chemistry’s protagonist has suffered because of her parents, but also because of what her parents have suffered, her identification with the difficulties they have faced to make a life in America. When Eric insinuates that her mother should speak English with him, though he has been learning Chinese, she’s furious. Her mother might have hurt her, but she is protective, too, of the woman who has walked such an unwelcoming path. She’s caught in between, unable to fully identify with her mother, or with her loving, oblivious boyfriend. Life, and even chemistry, have proven messier than the narrator allowed for as the book progresses. Her best friend, married and expecting a child, might seem to embody the right answer to her Eric dilemma, but that friend’s marriage and baby don’t provide a simple happy ending. Letting go of him doesn’t offer a simple, neat conclusion either. No matter how hard and determinedly she works, the chemistry Ph.D. may not be in the cards for her. There’s no straight line from hard work and potential to perfect success, which means she’s not equipped with the tools she needs for adulthood after all. Wang’s novel depicts a smart woman confronting an unplanned roadblock in her carefully engineered path, then feeling her way toward a terrifying unknown. The tight first-person can feel somewhat claustrophobic and familiar ― a cerebral depressive slowly unraveling in front of herself ― and much like the protagonist’s Ph.D. project, Chemistry doesn’t astound with its originality of concept or virtuosic language. But the work has its quiet, unassuming power, as the narrator’s clinical approach and outsider eye infuses the story of her mental breakdown with both wry humor and pathos.  The Bottom Line: Weike Wang explores a young chemist’s reckoning with her own limits and possibilities in this capably crafted, thoughtful novel. What other reviewers think: Kirkus: “Though essentially unhinged, the narrator is thoughtful and funny, her scramble understandable. It is her voice—distinctive and appealing—that makes this novel at once moving and amusing, never predictable.” Publishers Weekly: “A clipped, funny, painfully honest narrative voice lights up Wang’s debut novel about a Chinese-American graduate student who finds the scientific method inadequate for understanding her parents, her boyfriend, or herself.” Who wrote it? Chemistry is Weike Wang’s first novel. She has published short fiction in journals such as Redivider and Alaska Quarterly Review. Wang graduated with a bachelor’s degree in chemistry from Harvard, where she also received a Ph.D. in public health. She holds an MFA from Boston University. Who will read it? Readers who enjoy deep first-person psychological portraits, and fictional examinations of mental health struggles and the travails of academia.  Opening lines: “The boy asks the girl a question. It is a question of marriage. Ask me again tomorrow, she says, and he says, That’s not how this works. “Diamond is no longer the hardest mineral known to man. New Scientist reports that lonsdaleite is. Lonsdaleite is 58 percent harder than diamond and forms only when meteorites smash themselves into earth.” Notable passage: “The PhD advisor visits my desk, sits down, brings his hands together, and asks, Where do you see your project going in five years? “Five years? I say in disbelief. I would hope to be graduated by then and in the real world with a job. “I see, he says. Perhaps then it is time to start a new project, one that is more within your capabilities.  “He leaves me to it. “The desire to throw something at his head never goes away. Depending on what he says, it is either the computer or the desk. “I sketch out possible projects. Alchemy, for one. If I could achieve that today, I could graduate tomorrow.” ChemistryBy Weike WangKnopf, $24.95Publishes May 23, 2017   The Bottom Line is a weekly review combining plot description and analysis with fun tidbits about the book."
ARTS & CULTURE,Neil Gaiman Will Dramatically Read Dr. Seuss If We Raise $1 Million For Refugees,"The Cheesecake Factory’s menu is the In Search of Lost Time of the restaurant industry, in that it is far too long and probably includes a madeleine or two.  Neil Gaiman is a very famous author (American Gods, Stardust, Coraline) with a notably soothing British accent, who has nothing to do with the Cheesecake Factory but has been dared to read its convoluted bill of fare anyway. How’d this happen? It all began with writer/comedian Sara Benincasa, a self-professed cheesecake addict, whose Twitter bio now reads “Neil Gaiman Will Read The Entire @Cheesecake Menu If We Raise $500K For @Refugees.”  Dear @neilhimself: for $500K to the charity of your choice would you read the Cheesecake Factory menu in its entirety onstage pls advise pic.twitter.com/0pptJKTaM0 In a Crowdrise campaign launched today, she outlined her mission to coax Gaiman into performing a dramatic reading of the menu ― which, according to Benincasa, consists of at least “8,000 pages,” representing what we feel is a very reasonable estimate. The campaign states plainly: I asked Neil Gaiman if he’d do a live reading of the Cheesecake Factory menu if I raised $500,000 for a charity of his choice. And because he’s not just a great artist but a great person, he said yes. He chose UNHCR, the United Nations Refugee Agency. I want to hit this goal by World Refugee Day on June 20.  Why? Well, why not? Gaiman has already agreed to comply with the absurd Cheesecake challenge. If, you know, his fans are capable of scrounging together half a million dollars before June 20. Plus, he’s since upped the ante, offering to read Dr. Seuss’s Fox in Socks if fans pledge an additional $500,000 ― that’s $1 million total ― for the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR). I have said Yes. If she makes it happen, for charity, I will do this thing. https://t.co/vkJWVDiYTJ And @neilhimself added on tumblr that if it gets to $1m he'll add in Fox in Sox. #NeilCake https://t.co/uornvZ4VOf So far the campaign has raised just over $17,00, so Gaiman’s readers certainly have some donating to do.

ARTS & CULTURE,One Of The Biggest Challenges New York Artists Face Is Affording Supplies,"To make it as an artist in New York City, you’ll need resilience, passion and a singular creative vision. Oh, and supplies. You’ll probably need some supplies.  While art supplies are the literal building blocks of many artists’ work, tools like paint, brushes, canvases, paper and clay are becoming harder to afford, especially in a city already as pricey as NYC. A recent report published by the Department of Cultural Affairs (DCA) found that 40 percent of New York artists cannot afford art supplies, whatever they may be. New York has long been mythologized as a home for established and emerging artists, a cultural hotbed that attracts and welcomes creatives from around the country and beyond. Yet due to the high costs of rent, food and pretty much everything else in the city ― not to mention the crippling weight of student loan debt ― young artists are largely unable to afford the materials they need to make work. This sad statistic falls in line with much of the DCA’s findings, which depict an art world that primarily caters to and is made available to high-income earners.  “Many low-income community members don’t feel empowered to engage in the variety of arts and culture opportunities in NYC,” one Queens public housing resident is quoted as saying in the report. “More needs to be done to bring the arts to low-income communities, and in bringing low-income community members to prestigious arts and culture institutions.”  What can be done to ensure that art is a viable career choice for young people without a trust fund? The availability of cheaper rent for apartments and studio spaces seems to be a good starting point. According to the DCA, 90 percent of art and culture workers requested more affordable spaces to live and make work.  As the report cites, there are approximately 250,000 arts and culture workers currently in NYC, 64 percent of whom moved to the city to pursue professional opportunities in the arts. The annual economic impact of the cultural sector overall is, according to the report, around $130 billion.  In total, the DCA reached out to 180,000 New Yorkers between September 2016 and April 2017, polling culturally active individuals including artists, teachers, students, leaders of arts organizations and union members both in person and online. The overwhelming conclusion communicated by participants was a broader need for public and accessible arts programming and education spread throughout the five boroughs, especially in under-served and under-represented neighborhoods, ensuring art is indeed for everyone, regardless of socioeconomic status. The DCA is accepting feedback on this report and issues related to it until May 31. “CreateNYC: What We Heard” events will also be held across the city."
ARTS & CULTURE,"In 2017, Casting A Black Actor Derailed A Staging Of This Famous Play","“I am furious and dumbfounded,” Oregon-based theater producer Michael Streeter wrote on Facebook last week. “The Edward Albee Estate needs to join the 21st Century.” The short statement ― totaling just over 50 words ― claimed that the estate of the late Pulitzer-winning playwright had withdrawn the rights to his play “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?,” disallowing Streeter from staging the well-known production in Portland. Its reason, according to the post? Streeter had cast a black actor in the supporting role of Nick. “The Albee Estate called and said I need to fire the black actor and replace him with a white one,” he added. “I refused, of course.” According to The New York Times, a spokesperson for the Albee estate maintains that it hadn’t exactly withdrawn Streeter’s permission to stage the play ― namely because it hadn’t provided explicit permission to begin with. But the spokesperson did confirm the crux of Streeter’s statement: It indeed objected to the casting of a black actor in the play. “It is important to note that Mr. Albee wrote Nick as a Caucasian character, whose blonde hair and blue eyes are remarked on frequently in the play, even alluding to Nick’s likeness as that of an Aryan of Nazi racial ideology,” spokesperson Sam Rudy allegedly wrote in a letter to Streeter. “Furthermore, Mr. Albee himself said on numerous occasions when approached with requests for nontraditional casting in productions of ‘Virginia Woolf’ that a mixed-race marriage between a Caucasian and an African-American would not have gone unacknowledged in conversations in that time and place and under the circumstances in which the play is expressly set by textual references in the 1960s.” “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf,” a widely adapted play, centers on husband-and-wife duo George and Martha, whose lack of marital bliss becomes the central conflict of a night of drinking with a younger couple, Nick and Honey. First staged in 1962, Albee ― known to demand creative control over various productions of his play ― originally conceived the play’s characters as white, including, as Rudy pointed out, a description of Nick that involves the word “blond.” Streeter, in a subsequent Facebook post, explained his “color-conscious” casting choice further: I believe casting Nick as black adds depth to the play. The character is an up and comer. He is ambitious and tolerates a lot of abuse in order to get ahead. I see this as emblematic of African Americans in 1962, the time the play was written. The play is filled with invective from Martha and particularly George towards Nick. With each insult that happens in the play, the audience will wonder, ‘Are George and Martha going to go there re. racial slurs?’ There are lines that I think this casting gives resonance to, such as the fact that his (white) wife has ‘slim hips’ and when he says he’s ‘nobody’s houseboy’. He is a biologist and it is suggested that he is looking to make everyone the same. (Nazism and Arianism is implied, but never specifically mentioned.) This could be a reasonable goal or fantasy for an African American biologist in 1962 for the distant future.  He went on to say that he does “not question the motives of those that made the decision” on behalf of the estate, adding that he believes “they have some fealty to a sense of integrity to Edward Albee’s desires.” “But I had hoped the negative aspects of Albee would die with him,” he concluded. “All I did was post a very short Facebook rant about my disappointment in their decision. I think they made the wrong one. I think the benefits of casting Nick with an African American Actor outweigh the drawbacks.” Streeter also acknowledged that the estate had not yet granted him full rights to stage the play at Shoebox Theater, in a production originally scheduled for this fall; rather, his ability to move forward rested on receiving casting approval from the estate.  The Times noted that Albee had previously issued concern regarding the potential casting of a black actress as Martha, the daughter of a college president: “That would instantly raise a lot of questions, since it’s a totally naturalistic play,” he said. “Is this a black college? Do we have a black president of a white college? Not very likely.” According to The Guardian, Albee also took action in order to halt a version of the play with two gay couples. The estate’s refusal to grant rights to Streeter has reinvigorated conversations about colorblind and color-conscious casting in theater ― the latter technique being one that was famously employed by Lin-Manuel Miranda’s production of “Hamilton.” Several theater fans even remarked on seeing “Virginia Woolf” with actors of color before. Streeter himself wondered whether or not the casting of an interracial couple in particular was the sole reason for the estate refusing to grant rights. “I think if I had proposed an all black cast they may have been more open to approving it,” he wrote. Still, the estate’s reasoning fell flat for many. “The reasoning, if that’s quite the word, of the Albee estate doesn’t seem to be simple racism,” Scott Simon explained on NPR. “It sounds like convoluted racism.” “This is terrible,” journalist Mark Harris wrote on Twitter. “I don’t know if this reflects Albee’s wish. If it does, that wish should not have survived him.” The husband of the actress originally cast as Martha in Streeter’s production took to Facebook to post his reaction, too: “While we are Whitewashing our movies and pop culture on a daily basis (Emma Stone as Native Hawaiian in ‘Aloha,’ Zach McGowan as a native Hawaiian, David Carradine as a Chinese man in ‘Kung Fu’?! and how about JESUS CHRIST as a blonde-haired, blue-eyed, white guy?!?!) we have a responsibility to #Resist these weak excuses for allowing racism to exist.” UPDATE: In an email to HuffPost, Streeter explained that he believes the recent coverage of his play has amounted to a “new and ongoing discussion of the issues of authorial control, particularly after the author’s death, and diversity in casting. I see these as positive developments.” When asked whether there have been any other developments in the story since news of the Albee estate’s decision broke, he added that he is “pursuing a new play to produce. It will take some time.” HuffPost has reached out to the Edward Albee estate by way of the Edward Albee Foundation for comment and will update this post accordingly if and when we hear back."
ARTS & CULTURE,Basquiat Painting Sells For Record $110.5 Million At Sotheby's Auction,"A Jean-Michel Basquiat painting just sold for the highest price ever paid at auction for an American artist’s work: a whopping $110.5 million. The 72-by-68-inch acrylic and oil stick “Untitled” painting of a skull by the late graffiti artist was the subject of 10 minutes of intense bidding Thursday night at a Sotheby’s auction in New York City. The opening bid of $57 million drew gasps from the audience, Bloomberg reported. Sotheby’s had estimated it would sell for at least $60 million. It was the sixth-highest amount ever paid at auction for any work of art, putting Basquiat in the rarefied company of the celebrated Spanish artist Pablo Picasso. Only 10 works have sold for more than $100 million. The successful bidder, Japanese art collector Yusaku Maezawa, an e-commerce billionaire, announced in an Instagram post showing him standing next to the work that he had “just won this masterpiece.” “When I first encountered this painting, I was struck with so much excitement and gratitude for my love of art,” he added. “I want to share that experience with as many people as possible.”  I am happy to announce that I just won this masterpiece. When I first encountered this painting, I was struck with so much excitement and gratitude for my love of art. I want to share that experience with as many people as possible.  バスキア落札しました。アートを好きになってよかった。このペインティングをはじめて見た時、心からそう思いました。みなさんにも見てもらえる機会を作れたらいいなと思っています。  #jeanmichelbasquiat #basquiat #バスキア #ありがとう @sothebys A post shared by Yusaku Maezawa (@yusaku2020) on May 18, 2017 at 5:33pm PDT Collectors Jerry and Emily Spiegel bought the painting for $19,000 in 1984, when Basquiat was virtually unknown and had never been publicly exhibited. Basquiat died of a heroin overdose in 1988 at the age of 27 after painting for seven years. He created the skull in 1982. It’s considered one of his most important works still in private hands. Maezawa said he plans to loan the work to institutions around the world before making it one of the centerpieces of a museum he has created in his hometown of Chiba, Japan. The businessman last year bought another 1982 Basquiat painting of a devil at a Christie’s auction for $57.3 million, which at the time was the most ever paid for a work by the artist. The Basquiat was part of a Sotheby’s Contemporary Art Evening Auction of American post-war paintings that also featured works by such artists as Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol and Robert Rauschenberg."

ARTS & CULTURE,"The RompHim Isn't Just Lame Wordplay, It's A Sign Of Male Fragility","Candles, yogurt, rosé, and now rompers: Our capitalistic marketplace overflows with desirable, fun products that suffer from their association with women. Fortunately, businesses have found a way to market their goods to both women and men: bro branding. (”Bronding”?) We’ve had mandles, brogurt, brosé, and now the latest example, the RompHim™, a short jumpsuit for men. The RompHim launched via Kickstarter this week and quickly drew derision from Twitter wits. Men in rompers! Imagine! The summer romper, a cute number that typically looks like a sundress with shorts instead of a skirt, has firmly established itself in the past few years as a popular option for women. Though nearly impossible in bathroom contexts (nothing like hovering naked over a public toilet with one’s entire outfit pooled around one’s ankles to induce skepticism of the trend), it’s otherwise quite convenient. Women can have all the flirty style of a short sundress without the fear of stiff winds, bicycling and sitting cross-legged.  Both men and women have rocked jumpsuits before this latest romper bubble, but the sudden popularity of ruffled, floral jumpsuits for women seems to have tainted the style’s gender-neutral reputation. Many of the recent Twitter jibes directed at the garment centered around the absurdity of a man dressing like a woman ― showing up to a date wearing the same romper as his female counterpart, preening himself over his cute new look, etc.  There’s a genuine merit to the RompHim™ approach: Rompers are convenient (probably even more so for men, who will be able to pee in a romper without disrobing), and they’ve become ubiquitous in women’s fashion but not men’s. But it’s infuriating that advertisers have come to rely on artificial layers of masculinization to convince men to buy products that should be gender-neutral.  Pink wine? That’s girl stuff. Brosé, though, that’s something for bros. Yogurt is something ladies in grey hoodies eat to maintain their svelte figures in between mothering and wifing, but brogurt is powerful, protein-packed nourishment for men. Scented candles are chick tchotchkes, but a mandle redolent of freshly mown football fields is perfect for your man cave. The products are marketed directly at men who actually want scented candles, rompers and rosé, but who fear their very masculinity will come into question if they indulge. Even as feminists chip away at the socially constructed gender roles that men and women have long felt obligated to perform, male anxiety seems more pervasive than ever. While women feel empowered to lean in to male roles ― and styles ― men battle internal and external pressure to protect a male-only space that distinguishes them from the “weaker” sex. Women today wear pants, Oxford shoes and shirts, and menswear-inspired everything; it’s still rare to see a man in a skirt, and many even find men in shorts to be laughable. Our conception of what men can wear remains as narrow as it was 50 years ago, if not more so.  her: romperhim: ROMPHIMher: shirthim: SHIMTher: pantshim: MANTSher: waterhim: BROATER.. FOR MEN In the past, activists have mocked the pinkification of products to appeal to women ― perhaps most hilariously, Bic for Her ballpoint pens ― but apparently when women buy basic, mainstream products, men become embarrassed to consume the same things. It’s not too hard to get women to buy gender-neutral items (or even male-coded ones: think of the popularity of “boyfriend” jeans). After all, liking and using things men like and use can result in higher status for women. Drink whiskey, watch football, down a plateful of wings ― as long as you’re hot, you’re the perfect woman, and even if you’re not a solid nine, your choices will at least be deemed respectable. It’s men who nurture the more acute anxiety about gender neutrality. (This makes sense; in a world divided neatly into men and women, men have almost uniformly gleaned the advantages from this demarcation.) A man watching “Real Housewives” with a glass of zinfandel in a romper is flouting gender norms, but by adopting the lesser-respected female-coded habits. His wine and outfit need to be placed in a separate, more macho category than the identical versions consumed by women. “Don’t worry,” says a carton emblazoned with the name Powerful Yogurt, “just because you’re eating yogurt like a lady doesn’t mean you’re effeminate! You’re still the man here.” A 2016 follow-up on brogurt noted that brands like Powerful Yogurt were going “gender-neutral”: “[Excluding women] was a risk,” said one executive of their male-focused advertising. Was it, though? Women have always been OK buying products coded as male ― even as men run screaming from anything pink or cute. RompHim suggests their men’s cut rompers as a good option for women who prefer a unisex silhouette; the reverse of that two-birds-one-stone approach would never work out.  The veritable rash of bro-ified terms for non-gendered products shows how deep male fragility runs: A man’s manhood requires constant signaling and buttressing to remain secure. Men who step out of line are derided as emasculated and sexually confused. For men to reap the benefits of a gender-neutral world, we rely on verbal tricks that only reinforce the gender-normative stereotypes that keep men boxed in. The real progress will be made when men can drink rosé in a romper without a single batted eyelash or “bro” prefix."
ARTS & CULTURE,"Nick Kroll And John Mulaney's 'Oh, Hello' Is The Perfect Netflix Special","Netflix is home to a lot of comedy specials: Ali Wong, Aziz Ansari, Tracy Morgan, Maria Bamford, Jim Gaffigan, Louis C.K. ― they’ve all got one. But, making their special extra special, comedians Nick Kroll and John Mulaney are bringing a different kind of routine to the streaming service this summer. That’s right, “Oh, Hello,” their sold-out Broadway play based on “Kroll Show” characters Gil Faizon and George St. Geegland, is headed for a screen near you. OH HELLO ON BROADWAY WILL PREMIERE ON @netflix AROUND THE WORLD JUNE 13th!! pic.twitter.com/tb9VJ8oGfa If you’re unfamiliar with Gil and George’s schtick, just imagine the elderly muppets Statler and Waldorf come to life with a mission to prank (or, “prahnk”) people into eating enormous tuna sandwiches. They do so while hosting a public-access show, wearing a lot of turtlenecks and suffering from bagel-induced cholesterol. If you’re versed in the improv-heavy antics of the “Oh, Hello” men, then you’re probably aware of how difficult it was to get your hands on a ticket to their comedy act on Broadway, which closed earlier this year after more than 100 performances. Kroll and Mulaney (who has a Netflix comedy special of his own) have actually been honing the characters since the early 2000s, long before the “Kroll Show” premiered on Comedy Central. But the duo has become particularly popular in recent years, as the comedians took their act to late-night show couches. On Broadway, Kroll and Mulaney welcomed a slew of famous guests to their stage, including Will Ferrell, Tina Fey, Whoopi Goldberg, Jerry Seinfeld and Amy Schumer. According to Playbill, the performances streaming on Netflix on June 13 will likely include footage from two taped performances that occurred on Jan. 19 and 20.

ARTS & CULTURE,Will The City’s Cultural Plan Walk The Talk Of Equity?,"By Kerry McCarthy and Michelle Coffey In May 2015, New York City decided to create its first cultural plan to direct the City’s policies on arts and culture, from generating affordable live/work spaces for artists to determining where arts education dollars are spent. Soon thereafter, the field buzzed about ways to change the City’s outdated funding model to rebalance its investment in arts and culture.  When the planning process began last fall, initial conversations were about dedicating more City money to the arts, so that everyone—large performing arts centers, community museums, neighborhood culturally explicit arts groups, individual artists, and public school children—would benefit. But the 2016 presidential election changed things. With the federal administration expected to make cuts to programs New Yorkers care about—affordable housing, healthcare, and climate resilience, for example—we should expect significant cuts to both the State and City’s budgets. This does not bode well for an expansion of the City’s investments in cultural affairs or arts education. The Department of Cultural Affairs’ piece of the pie is likely to shrink, not get bigger. The City has set many impressive goals for itself in the draft policy proposals for the Cultural Plan that were released on Monday. The planning team is asking City residents to vote on the final goals of the Cultural Plan, which will be released this July. After reading these proposed goals, we ask, how will the Cultural Plan fulfill Mayor de Blasio’s pledge to make New York a more equitable city?  Talking about equity and acting on it are two different things. How will the City ensure that more resources flow directly into and sustain the leadership of historically marginalized communities? How will the plan make sure that funds earmarked for diversity, equity, and inclusion are not simply co-opted by mainstream groups at the exclusion of smaller, culturally explicit agencies that have been historically undercapitalized? How will it ensure that investments in diversifying talent pipelines benefit everyone, not just large, mainstream organizations? Overall, how can the Cultural Plan promote a truly equitable sector?  Further, how will the City hold itself accountable? What policies will change, and what measures will be used to enact an equitable distribution of City funding that ensures smaller, grassroots groups benefit? How will the City change its funding formula to put its stated commitment to equity into action? As City Council Majority Leader Jimmy Van Bramer – also chair of the City’s Cultural Affairs Committee – said in a recent interview with the New York Times, “…budgets are statements of values, budgets are about priorities.” As funders committed to helping our City’s arts and cultural groups thrive, we want to advance a system that allows culture to flourish and ensures equal access for all New Yorkers, no matter where they live. We welcome creative thinking about ways to achieve cultural equity in our communities, and we encourage all New Yorkers to register their voices and demand equity in the Cultural Plan by reviewing the draft proposals and voting in the poll here.

ARTS & CULTURE,How 'Master Of None' Captures The Loneliness Of Constant Connectivity,"Lately, there’s been much ado about clutter. There’s too much of it; it’s everywhere! Our closets are cluttered, our newsfeeds our cluttered, our schedules are cluttered. Our dating lives are cluttered, too. How’s a young, single person supposed to navigate the cutie overload of Tinder et al, to slow down long enough to form a genuine connection?  And, if this is what life is like now ― go, go, go ― how are today’s stories to capture what it means to be a person in the world? If a story is meant to be realistic ― to mirror life as it is, rather than canting it to illuminate impurities ― can it even be entertaining anymore, or can it be nothing more than a portrait of app-fueled malaise?  Season 2 of “Master of None” manages to answer all of these questions artfully. In its 10 30-minute episodes, creators Aziz Ansari and Alan Yang bring us to Modena, Italy, then back to New York. We’re taken on a barrage of awkward first dates, and to one family’s Thanksgiving dinner table, which evolves as decades pass. The resulting collage is a plush image of modern life, its whirlwind moments and its moments of listlessness and isolation. The show concedes that being a young person today does mean living amid clutter. Conversations between characters stray far from their own firsthand experiences, delving instead into the cultural references that busy their lives. There’s an entire episode that is structured around disparate groups of people coming together to see a Nic Cage blockbuster, a bad-good movie with a shockingly offensive twist. The cultural touchstone is everywhere, infiltrating cab ads and moments shared between friends. In their short book What Was the Hipster? the editors of n+1 identified pastiche as one of the hallmarks of the hipster lifestyle. Whether or not Ansari has read their take, his choice to fill his realistic show with scenes centered on TV-making, TV-watching, video game-playing and “Friends” references makes the character’s stories feel true. There are smaller, subtler ways in which “Master of None” generates the stifling sensation that input is everywhere ― Dev’s mildly grating text message ringer, for example, is always going off. But the show smartly includes long, painful stretches of technological silence, too. When Dev’s phone is stolen during Season 2’s first episode, just after he’s nabbed the number of a girl he met over lunch, he suddenly notices how engrossed everyone else is in their own phone-bound lives. In one of the show’s rare moments of absurdity, there’s even a close-up of an Italian man intimately smooching his device while Dev looks on in envy. These moments of aimlessness and longing amid a dizzying haze of information are some of the most potent of the season. After an online date turns from promising to awkward, Dev sits alone in a cab, and everything’s silent but street sounds. During a trip north of New York City to Storm King, a permanent art installation, Dev and Francesca stare out at the leaves and quietly take in the scene. (And then, Dev quips about the spot’s WiFi password.) The show makes a conscious effort to punctuate periods of technological clutter with stretches of quiet, and in that way, it recreates the ebbs and flows of modern life. Ansari isn’t the first storyteller to try to strike this balance of quick, clever banter and real, human feeling. In 2000, the literary critic James Wood wrote a controversial essay centered on Zadie Smith’s White Teeth. “A genre is hardening,” Wood wrote, and he continued to describe a group of authors ― including Smith, Salman Rushdie, Don DeLillo and David Foster Wallace ― who write what he describes as “hysterical realism,” or realistic stories that reflect the noise of modern life without the feeling of human connections and individual struggles.   Since Wood’s essay was written, there’ve been several commendable novels published that do manage to encompass both the quick clip of modernity and the listless lives of those caught in its grasp; Tony Tulathimutte’s Private Citizens and Tao Lin’s Taipei exemplify this type of storytelling. (It’s probably not a coincidence that both authors directly engage with life on the Internet.) But “Master of None” might be the only show to take on these topics in a manner that doesn’t make Tinder the butt of a joke. Instead, it’s just another part of the world that Dev moves through, publicly and privately.  In one of this season’s strongest scenes (aside from the couple of near-perfect “bottle episodes” that have already been lovingly described elsewhere), Dev and his goofy bud Arnold are eating dinner at a world-famous restaurant, but each of them is unable to enjoy the meal, because, although they’re the only two people present, they’re separately engrossed in their own personal dramas. We as viewers know that each of them is bummed about his romantic prospects, but they each think the other is better off than themselves. That’s dramatic irony, and it’s often what engages us with a character’s struggles.  These dramas that fuel great stories may seem scarcer in a world of instant gratification; Romeo and Juliet could’ve shacked up for life, if only they had cell phones. But these little rifts between how we feel and what we say, what we hear and what we understand, are still everywhere. They’re in your perfectly lit Instagram of your runny, eggy brunch; they’re in the chipper string of emojis you send to an OK date. They’re in the quiet Lyft trip, when you’re the only rider left. You can be highbrow. You can be lowbrow. But can you ever just be brow? Welcome to Middlebrow, a weekly examination of pop culture. Read more here."
ARTS & CULTURE,Portraits Of Librarians Celebrate America's Bookish Unsung Heroes,"Librarians hold a deceptively humble, yet powerful, role: Whether you’re a young child or an adult, a new student or an erudite academic, they offer guidance to rich worlds of literacy and scholarship. Librarians are on the front lines, putting a friendly face to the idea of book love and helping millions of Americans get the resources, encouragement and support they need to become avid readers.  Who our librarians are, then, actually matters a great deal. In Kyle Cassidy’s new book This Is What a Librarian Looks Like, the photographer reveals portraits of hundreds of librarians, sharing both their sunny faces and their thoughts on the value of libraries. The result: a colorful tapestry of men and women of all ages, races and ethnicity, some dressed conservatively and some with tattoos and brightly dyed hair, but all bursting with smiles and enthusiasm for their life missions. In his introduction, Cassidy writes that he began the project after one of his future subjects, Naomi Gonzales, asked him to attend an American Library Association meeting. “She promised me,” he recalls, “that librarians were both friendly and photogenic” ― a bold claim that is backed up by his project. His book, which features guest essays by writers like Jeff Vandermeer, Neil Gaiman and Amy Dickinson, doesn’t shy away from discussing the challenges libraries face in an era of threats to public funding and a rising emphasis on digital resources over print collections. Nonetheless, the tone is heartwarming and optimistic, encapsulating the idealistic value for the written word and commitment to equal opportunity that many associate with libraries. Above all, the volume is a touching reminder of the loving human work that keeps our libraries thriving, ready to help us when we need them. Below, we’ve excerpted several portraits from This Is What a Librarian Looks Like: Images and captions courtesy of Black Dog & Leventhal. This Is What a Librarian Looks Like: A Celebration of Librarians, Communities, and Access to Information will be published on May 16 and will be available on Amazon or from your local indie bookstore ― or check your local library!"
ARTS & CULTURE,Haunting Sculpture Offers A Surreal Glimpse At The Future Of Climate Change,"Those visiting the Venice this year may have noticed something unusual while passing the Ca’ Sagredo Hotel: two giant hands reaching out from the murky, aquamarine waters below. The disorienting vision is a sculpture called “Support” by artist Lorenzo Quinn, meant to provide a daunting premonition of the potential damage caused by climate change. “Venice is a floating art city that has inspired cultures for centuries,” the artist said, in a statement released by Halcyon Gallery. “But to continue to do so it needs the support of our generation and future ones, because it is threatened by climate change and time decay.”  A big thank you to all for your comments and likes. It's been overwhelming. I wish I could thank each and everyone of you individually. This sculpture 'Support' placed in Venice at Ca' Sagredo, coinciding with the opening of the Venice Biennale, wants to speak to the people in a clear, simple and direct way through the innocent hands of a child and it evokes a powerful message which is that united we can make a stand to curb the climate change that affects us all.

In part, Quinn was intrigued by the idea of creating hands because they are “considered the hardest and most technically challenging part of the human body,” also possessing “the power to love, to hate, to create, to destroy.” Quinn constructed the massive hands in a studio off-site, then transported them via canal to the hotel. You can see parts of the lengthy construction process on Instagram.  Two human hands forge a lasting imprint in the viewer’s mind, perfectly mimicking the potential the body parts possess in real life ― to support, to defend, to create change. The visceral image is intended to draw focus on the fragility of the environments we too often take for granted, emphasizing the power of humans to either salvage or seal their fates.  The artist, as he explained on Instagram, “wants to speak to the people in a clear, simple and direct way through the innocent hands of a child and it evokes a powerful message which is that united we can make a stand to curb the climate change that affects us all. We must all collectively think of how we can protect our planet and by doing that we can protect our national heritage sites.”  Yes!...so happy to say mission accomplished. 'SUPPORT' in Venice to support this wonder of city that is threatened by climate change. I hope my art brings a new focus of attention to a global calamity that we are faced with. Art in 'Support' of art: Venice is now the art capital of the world during the Venice Biennale but the city of art is threatened and needs our help and protection. ------A big thank you to the city of Venice and especially to its Mayor Luigi Brugnaro for believing in this installation from the beginning, to Ca' Sagredo hotel represented by Lorenza Lain (the force of Nature) to C and C architectural Studio, Fulvio Caputo, Marco Zanon, Ufficine delle Zattere, Luisa Flora, Tecmolde, Julio and Irene Luzan and the entire team, She Digital, Grupoo Orseolo with Rein srl and the Gondolieri of Venice.

ARTS & CULTURE,Stunning Photos Debunk The Myth That Queerness Is 'Un-African',"As a kid, Nigerian-born photographer Mikael Chukwuma Owunna knew of no other LGBTQ Africans personally, and he saw none represented in popular culture or mainstream media. His family and community hardly spoke of people being queer, and when they did, the tone was nearly always one of disdain.  “Growing up being queer and Nigerian, I felt like I could not exist,” Owunna told HuffPost. The artist was 15 years old, living in the United States, when he was outed as gay to his family, who blamed America and Western culture for his sexual identity. They proposed he return to Nigeria twice a year, hoping the culture would “cure” Owunna of his desire. “They thought that since being gay was ‘un-African,’ re-exposing me to my culture would drive the gay out of me,” he said.  Three and a half years ago, Owunna decided to respond to this injurious claim ― that queerness and African-ness can not and do not overlap ― by capturing portraits of individuals who are proudly both African and queer, gay or transgender. “I’ve been fighting to reclaim these two parts of my identity for myself,” he explained. “To create a queer African home for myself and others where we can be LGBTQ, African and whole.” The series, called “Limit(less),” is part– anthropological study and part– street style shoot, aiming to capture, as Owunna put it, what LGBTQ African immigrants look like when they feel free. It features 34 portraits, mostly taken in North America, each accompanied by an interview that probes deeply into the life and personal style of the subject.  In part, the work is inspired by a photo series by South African photographer Zanele Muholi called “Faces & Phases,” which Owunna saw at the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh. The images depict black lesbians based in South Africa, their faces boldly featured against plain walls or patterned backdrops. “Seeing that work, I was so incredibly moved,” Owunna said. “Especially coming from my own experience of feeling completely invisible and erased as a queer African person.” With “Limit(less),” Owunna attempts to challenge the binary understanding that sets queerness at odds with the African identity. Yet it was important to him that the project not cast homophobia as something innately African. The ignorance and hatred many young, queer Africans now face, Owunna explained, stems from the legacy of European colonialism, which, he said, “has brainwashed us to believe that being LGBTQ is somehow against our indigenous cultural identities.”  Owunna cited Nzinga of Ndongo ― a 17th-century African leader who insisted that the male harem who served her dress in women’s clothing ― as an example of Africa’s early openness in regard to gender expression.  Since Owunna had only met two other LGBTQ Africans in his entire life, he located the majority of his subjects on social media. When a potential subject expressed interest, Owunna reached out for a phone or Skype conversation, during which he would explain the concept of his work in full. Most importantly, he ensured the subjects were entirely comfortable participating in such a visible project, given the potential safety concerns that could arise as a result. “Even though we live in diaspora, there are still very real fears and dangers for us as LGBTQ African people both inside and outside of our communities,” he said.  The photographer then flew to visit each subject and spent the weekend in his, her or their home, spending a day getting to know each other before actually starting the shoot. The participants were also given interview questions beforehand regarding their personal style, their relationship with their families and what they might say to people who think being LGBTQ is “un-African”? The subjects’ written responses are as compelling and moving as the images themselves.  Em, an agender Nigerian living in America, responded to the last question above with: “You’re un-African for believing that all Africans are this monolithic group of people, cis and heteronormative. We are dynamic, bold, and beautiful and queer. Our Africanness is only stronger with this identity because every day we breathe, especially for African trans folk, we are resisting and revolutionary. That’s pretty damn African to me.” While fashion is seen by some as frivolous or superficial, Owunna’s subjects and their thoughtful answers illuminate how clothing can not only express identity but inform it. Netsie, a queer Ethiopian-Namibian woman in America, described how her personal style rejects the roles often foisted upon women of color. “From a young age, women are taught that they have no choice in who looks at them, and so often, we are held responsible for what other people perceive,” Netsie said. “We are taught to be presentable, not just for business meetings, but potential friends, mates and assaulters. At the same time, we are taught never to look threatening, or look back at the people looking at us. We are denied the verb, and forced into the noun. Fuck that. I’m a hard femme with an hourglass silhouette, a goodwill budget, and a firm grasp of anti-capitalist rhetoric. I wear whatever makes me feel comfortable and powerful and safe.” Reactions to “Limit(less),” Owunna told HuffPost, have been overwhelmingly positive, especially from LGBTQ African immigrants themselves. “I feel like there is such a hunger for us to see ourselves and people like us,” the artist said. “And to especially see other LGBTQ African people in a space of empowerment, loving ourselves.” Owunna’s contributions to visualizing a population that has for too long gone unrepresented are staggering, and he is not slowing down anytime soon. The artist is en route to creating the largest digital archive of LGBTQ African immigrant narratives in existence. Having worked primarily in North America so far, he’s headed to Europe ― home to over 6 million African immigrants. The artist is currently raising funds on Kickstarter to finance his journeys to Belgium, France, Portugal, Sweden and the U.K., gathering more stories and images every stop of the way. To continue the project, he needs $10,000 by June 8 ― at time of publication, he has raised just over $5,000.  Owunna looks forward to growing his archive, finally providing visibility for the next generation growing up African and queer. “With each click of my camera,” he said, “I strive to capture my vision of what a free world can look like for black queer and trans people. And to show that this free world already exists inside each and every one of us.” See more of Owunna’s “Limit(less)” on the project’s website."
ARTS & CULTURE,"As A Queer Kid In Rural France, This Writer Was Subjected To Extreme Violence","In Hallencourt, where writer Édouard Louis grew up, the word “violence” is seldom used. Which isn’t to say it’s a peaceful, idyllic place. There may be the ostensible benefits of the countryside; the surrounding area may be lively and green. But the town ― which, in France’s recent presidential race, favored the Trump-esque Marine Le Pen ― is marked by its gendered social values. Louis ― born Eddy Bellegueule ― writes in his novel The End of Eddy that he was chastised and bullied for his “affected” voice from a young age. His father and eldest brother were both drinkers and fighters. Like most men in Hallencourt, his father dropped out of high school to work at a factory, but was unable to continue his work due to an injured back. The author flatly recounts memories of his father, who would murder litters of kittens and brawl for sport. Louis, meanwhile, took pleasure in trying on women’s clothes, and devised excuses for skipping out on soccer practice. Louis’s parents, and others in town, eventually came to accept his queerness just as they conceded the personhood of the only black person they knew in town. But acceptance came with a stipulation, a rationalization: we like you because you’re not like the others. Being not like the others meant being tough. In Hallencourt, toughness was the highest virtue. It meant doing backbreaking work. It meant, in Louis’ case, not flinching when a classmate hocked a phlegmy wad of spit onto his face. Louis is gifted at limning visceral descriptions of squalor. His want to not allow doctors to cede control of his body, and his resulting choice to spray a tetanus-blackened foot with perfume; his dust-covered and smoke-filled home, made worse by having asthma; his dad’s proclivity for fixing up old TV’s, and demanding that the family watch together in silence over dinner. The psychological insights he culls from these experiences are poignant. His mother’s tendency to declare that she’s “not a lady,” the habit both kids and adults in town had of laughing at the pain of others, as though laughter conveyed strength of character. Of being bullied at school, Louis writes, “They laughed when my face began to turn purple from lack of oxygen (a natural response from working-class people, the simplicity of those who possess little and enjoy laughing, who know how to have a good time).” On the town’s rampant racism, Louis’ takeaways run the risk of being facile. “There is a will that exists, a desperate, constantly renewed effort to place some people on a level below you,” he explains plainly. Still, the writer’s emotional tenor and clear-sightedness make this a must-read for anyone looking to learn more about class in the West, and how it weighs on the state of politics. The bottom line A touching story that’s artfully told, The End of Eddy will both make you want to turn away ― the descriptions of violence are that rich, and sensate ― and continue on with its frank and generous author. Who wrote it Édouard Louis, aka Eddy Bellegueule, is the author of two novels. Michael Lucey, the book’s translator, is a professor of French literature at the University of California, Berkeley. Who will read it Anyone interested in the burgeoning subgenre of autofiction, or in stories about class, masculinity, and growing up queer. What other reviewers think Slate: “Coming to terms with his childhood has resulted in this stark and honest image of French working class society, rendered in an authentic voice.” Washington Post: “What is most impressive about The End of Eddy is that its author turned himself into a man capable of creating such a vivid and honest self-portrait.” Opening lines “From my childhood I have no happy memories. I don’t mean to say that I never, in all those years, felt any happiness or joy. But suffering is all-consuming: it somehow gets rid of anything that doesn’t fit into its system.” Notable passage “The truth was that the display of all these bits of flesh was driving me crazy. I was using words like fags, fairies, queers to keep my distance from them. I used these words against the others in the hope that they would stop invading every inch of my body.” The End of EddyÉdouard LouisFarrar, Straus and Giroux, $23.00May 2 The Bottom Line is a weekly review combining plot description and analysis with fun tidbits about the book."
ARTS & CULTURE,"No, Putin's Piano Recital Doesn't Make Him Any 'Softer'","Vladimir Putin, an authoritarian president who is more concerned with consolidating his own power over Russia than addressing the country’s shocking track record of human rights violations, can play the piano. That’s right, the leader of the world’s largest nation, who has threatened the very bedrock of free press and potentially encouraged the delegitimization of Western democracy, has some semblance of a musical talent.  Proof of such talent hit the internet on Monday morning in the form of a video of Putin playing Vasily Solovyov-Sedoi’s “Evening Song” and Tikhon Khrennikov’s “Moscow Windows” in Beijing. While you might have imagined such a recital unremarkable, others would disagree.  “The recital showed perhaps a softer side of Mr. Putin, an authoritarian leader who has been in power since 1999 and has often appeared eager to be seen as manly,” Ivan Nechepurenko wrote in a piece that appeared in The New York Times. The story was picked up by other outlets (including this one) and reported in a similar fashion by other publications, who made it a point to note that the piano playing represented a “softer” skill. When compared to his knack for invading other countries or supporting internationally condemned dictators, perhaps piano playing is a “softer” skill. But the arbitrariness of that comparison reveals the absurdity of the framing: Putin’s ability to play the piano doesn’t make him any softer, or even reveal a supposed “softer side.” As many people have pointed out on social media, several other men capable of heinous things have demonstrated a talent for the arts. So what?  Hitler was an artist. So was John Wayne Gacy. Not sure what your point is. https://t.co/NRhuVosfIA Next up, Kim Jong Un shares his favorite cookie recipes!   Keep up the great reporting, NY Times.https://t.co/aCw26zDfK0 @NPR Putin plays the piano Nero played the fiddle. New York Times: ""A piano recital in Beijing showed perhaps a softer side of Vladimir Putin"" pic.twitter.com/rSVK2muDPN Putin’s seemingly spontaneous public outings, always chronicled by a photographer on hand, have been covered before. He hunts, he fishes, he rides horses shirtless. His piano playing is but another public gesture, meant to humanize, even aggrandize, a president whose regime is riddled with corruption. But does it make a difference to anyone that Putin, capable of the atrocities mentioned here, has a “softer side”? Is artistic talent that redemptive of a quality? Artists are certainly not innately good or soft. (“Hard,” “evil” people can make art, too; to use a particularly popular example from history, Hitler was an acclaimed painter.) Neither is art itself. It can be uncomfortable, dark, provocative, nauseating. Just ask Hermann Nitsch. “The gooey notion that art should somehow be good for you ― Vitamin C for the soul ― is very American,” critic Christopher Knight wrote back in 1992.  When former American President George W. Bush announced his painting hobby, the internet was quick to praise such a nice, quaint retirement pastime. When he came out with his own art book, Portraits of Courage: A Commander in Chief’s Tribute to America’s Warriors, the praise continued, until a Hyperallergic article proposed that maybe we were focusing too much on “the transformative power of art.” He was, after all, the same president who’s believed to have “misled a nation into the Iraq War.”  Perhaps what’s particularly annoying about the framing of an article that suggests Putin, a totalitarian head of state, is somehow more sensitive after putting on a piano performance, is that it proposes that his talent is also the opposite of “manly” ― as opposed to his more “virile” hobbies: hunting and fishing and shirtless horseback riding. The overtly masculine descriptors are perplexingly outdated and sexist, because, obviously, virile men can play the piano and feminine women can hunt. At the end of the day, Putin’s piano playing means much less than he or his administration would like you to believe. Whether he’s performed before ― or done so badly ― does not matter.  Deborah Rothschild, the curator of a show of Hitler’s paintings, once said that, “The union of malevolence and beauty can occur; we must remain vigilant against its destructive power.” But Peter Schjeldahl, an art crtic at The New Yorker, probably said it better: We must remain vigilant against malevolence, and we should regard beauty as the fundamentally amoral phenomenon that it is. It does not matter."
ARTS & CULTURE,People Are Mad 'Handmaid's Tale' Doesn't Respect Scrabble Rules,"Scrabble is a word game, perfect for those with silver tongues and vast vocabularies. It’s also a game the characters in “The Handmaid’s Tale” do not play properly. The new Hulu TV show, adapted from Margaret Atwood’s novel of the same name, frequently features two of its main characters partaking in games of Scrabble. Offred, played by Elisabeth Moss, faces off in tense, albeit brief, word games with the Commander, played by Joseph Fiennes. These scenes are meant to be serious. The commander regularly invites Offred, disallowed from fraternizing with men otherwise, to secretly spar with him in his study at night. The meetings could be described as intimate, illicit and revealing. But fans and viewers of the series have been harping on a different aspect of the Scrabble scenes: Offred and the Commander don’t play by the rules. The scariest thing about the future in #HandmaidsTale is the flagrant disregard for the rules of Scrabble. I know they had to update “The Handmaid’s Tale” a bit for the television series but changing Scrabble to Words With Friends was a bit much Dude just poured all the letters out for Scrabble. It's easier to leave them in the bag. #handmaidstale They also seem to have inordinately high scores ... Second episode of The Handmaid's Tale seriously strains credibility by having a Scrabble game end with a score of 386-383 Some have said they’re just making up their own methods as they go ...   Handmaid's Tale, Ep. 4: The Commander incorrectly challenges Offred's word in Scrabble, but doesn't lose his turn. This adaption is bullshit Wait, if Offred drew an M and the Commander drew an A in the #handmaidstale Scrabble scene, why did she go first?! @alkat Higher value. @jocelyn528 Ah, but official game rules say the letter closest to ""A"" goes first ;) CC @HandmaidsOnHulu: https://t.co/oaChbHCd3i Others can’t believe these two players are getting such great letters every round ...   v difficult to suspend the requisite disbelief to get into handmaid's tale bc of this highly improbable scrabble game in episode 2 pic.twitter.com/o4AFAl8gTl The least believable part of 'The Handmaid's Tale' is their luck at Scrabble. Larynx? C'mon The lesson here is simple: Hulu, if you’re going to film people playing Scrabble, expect to get served."

ARTS & CULTURE,This 14-Year-Old’s Poem Breaks Apart The Wage Gap,"Right now, women face a wage gap in every single state. For those of you who don’t know what that means it’s simple: women are paid on average 79 cents on the dollar for doing the same job as a man. And the wage gap isn’t a symptom of women being less educated. Women with doctoral degrees are paid less than men with master’s degrees, and women with master’s degrees are paid less than men with bachelor’s degrees. But the wage gap doesn’t just exist across gender. The racial wage gap in America has not changed in thirty five years. New data from the Pew Research Center analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics cites that black men earned 73% of white men’s hourly earnings in 2015 — the exact percentage they earned in 1980. So how do we fix this? Well luckily we can turn to the wisdom of a 14-year-old. That’s right, Owen Pallenberg wrote another poem for us. This time the incredible young man is left to wonder why we’re not doing anything about the wage gap in America. When we asked Owen why he wrote the poem he said, “I decided to write about the issue of the gender and race Wage Gap in our country because it is a very serious problem that has been recently overlooked due to the issues with President Trump, Syria, Health Care, and in honor of Mother’s Day and the first annual 50/50 day.” Presented in full. We give you “79 Cents” by Owen Pallenberg: A woman makes on average 79 cents to the man’s buck, So the woman makes less because of her chromosome’s luck. This problem in our nation needs to end, Because yes, a woman makes less...I know it’s hard to comprehend. Minimum wage in California is $10.50 for a man, More like $8.92 for a woman, making it hard to create a viable financial plan. People claim that this gap is just a myth, But it’s a proven fact that they’re losing out on more than one fifth. The gap just gets worse for married women, women of color, and even mothers, Ridiculous, I know. Shouldn’t we all get paid the same as one another? Why are women blamed for things they can’t control, Once men and women are equal, we will finally reach our ultimate goal. Just take a look at the US Women’s National Soccer Team, They earn about 25% of what the men make, which is really quite extreme, Even though the women generate more revenue and won the World Cup, They get paid much less to lace them up. Black women make 63 cents to the man’s buck, And Latina women earn only 54 cents, so I guess they’re just out of luck. Deniers of these stats are obviously citing the alternative facts, Because it is quite clear that women receive a sales, property, income, and “woman” tax."
ARTS & CULTURE,Someone Made Erotic Art About Trump Meeting The Pope,"Whatever happens at President Donald Trump’s first meeting with Pope Francis later this month, it probably won’t include the passionate embrace one artist recently conjured up. A life-size mural depicting the pontiff ardently kissing the U.S. president appeared on a wall near the Vatican on Thursday, Reuters reported. The pope is illustrated with a saintly halo and a crucifix around his neck. Trump appears with a gold watch, a pistol and devil horns sprouting out of his head. The two men are locked in a steamy, mouth-to-mouth kiss. A caption written on the sash of the pope’s cassock reads “The Good Forgives the Evil.” The piece is signed “TVBoy,” believed to be Italian street artist Salvatore Benintende, who has done a number of kiss-related murals in the past. Francis and Trump are scheduled to meet at the Vatican on May 24 while the president is on a tour of Saudi Arabia, Israel, Italy and Belgium. It will be the first time the men meet in person after trading insults on social media and in interviews over the last year. TVBoy imagined the meeting going something like: “Angel Francis forgives the Devil Trump in Rome just before the G7,” the artist wrote on Instagram, referring to the summit of world powers the president will attend in Italy. Perhaps, TVBoy. Perhaps."
ARTS & CULTURE,Nationwide Art Project Is Making Space For Historic Women In All 50 States,"Just before the presidential election in November 2016, Polish-American artist Olek revealed which candidate was getting her vote by hanging a massive portrait of Hillary Clinton over a New Jersey highway. Upon closer inspection, what initially appeared to be a billboard was actually ― in Olek’s signature style ― a 16-by-46-foot neon pink blanket, entirely crocheted by hand.  Days later, Olek, like the rest of the world, learned that Clinton had lost the election and Donald Trump was to be president of the United States. “I immediately thought, I wish I had done more,” Olek told HuffPost in a phone call. “Then I thought: ‘Wait a second, I still can.’” Olek, born Agata Oleksiak, moved to the United States from Poland in 2003 and describes herself as a “young American and an old Pole” accordingly. At 38 years old, she is known for her experimental yarn creations, which combine the art of crochet ― with its traditional connotations of domestic “women’s work” ― with the tactics of guerrilla street art. Her most iconic creations, or “yarn bombs” as they’re often dubbed, include covering the Wall Street bull sculpture with pink and purple camouflage and crocheting a massive fictionalized edition of The New York Times. Olek’s current project is as much about the process of its creation as the final result.  Titled “Love Across the USA,” the piece will consist of 50 portraits of women who changed American history, displayed throughout all 50 states. “I want to honor women who fought their entire lives to open the doors for women like me,” Olek said. “Women who still don’t have enough space in history books.” The artist will travel from state to state until 2020, inviting local community members to help create each work. This community collaboration is where the real impact of Olek’s project takes place. “We’re living in a time when people are stuck to their computers,” she said. “I want to get people out of their homes, out of their habits. Community is so important. I’m getting people together.” Olek isn’t sure exactly which women she will honor throughout the series, although she mentioned Nina Simone, Sojourner Truth and Michelle Obama as some names on her list. She plans to honor women who are significant to each state, hopefully illuminating some lesser-known heroines who have not been sufficiently recognized on a national stage.  An inkling of Olek’s idea for the project emerged on election day, when Olek noticed viral photos and videos of women attaching their “I Voted” stickers to Susan B. Anthony’s grave in Rochester, New York. “It made me think, in the year 2020, women will only have been able to vote in this country for 100 years,” Olek said. “I knew I had to start with Susan B. Anthony.”  In March, coinciding with Women’s History Month, Olek made the trek to Rochester to begin the project. She reached out for volunteers on social media beforehand, inviting crochet masters and novices alike to join her in the process. Over 200 volunteers gathered at the Schweinfurth Art Center in Auburn, New York, where Olek held a crochet workshop for anyone interested in learning the basics. Using donated materials from Red Heart Yarn, each participant constructed a two-by-two-foot square, following a pattern Olek distributed. The squares were then combined to yield a towering portrait of a feminist icon.  Susan B. Anthony ended up being Olek’s second subject; the first, whose image was hung in early May, depicts abolitionist Harriet Tubman. “I couldn’t choose, I had to do both,” Olek said. Alongside Tubman’s face reads the quote: “Slavery is the next thing to hell,” written against a shocking pink backdrop. Anthony’s portrait, currently in the works, will be revealed later in the month. “I could not choose between Harriet and Susan,” Olek told HuffPost, adding that she “broke her rule” by choosing two subjects. The artist hopes to create at least one portrait in all 50 states but clearly is not opposed to adapting her mission along the way.  Olek described her experience working with local crocheters in Rochester as “incredibly powerful.” She described working with collaborators in their 70s, who had been crocheting since before Olek was born, who worked late nights that creeped into mornings. She described working with fathers and sons who had never crocheted before, yet were eager to learn and help.  The project is open to men and women of all political views. While crocheting together for hours on end, Olek explained, the volunteers often communicate about the many challenges of living in 2017. “We talk about what it means to be a women, what it means to support women,” Olek said. “We talk about health care, family, education. People form new friendships.” Beyond the physical existence of the works, it is the intimate experience of working with strangers that brings Olek the most pride. “Making pieces in my studio is not the same as going into the world,” she said. “I see the effect, how public art can change people. It’s not only about seeing the piece, but the impact the work has on the community.” Although the project was triggered in part by the election, Olek doesn’t describe her piece as explicitly political. “I want to go to red states, I want to go everywhere,” she explained. “Often artists don’t go to the smaller places, those are often the places that need us. Those people are equally important to the democracy of this country.” Eventually, Olek hopes to develop a computer program that can help individuals create their own crochet patterns. Then they too can pay homage to the women who inspire them, by printing patters and crocheting from there.  When describing how she landed upon her title for the ambitious endeavor, “Love Across the USA,” Olek recalled her experience preparing for the Women’s March in Washington, D.C., this January and deciding which sign to take with her. “I had this older piece in my studio that said, ‘Love Always Wins. Haha Not Really,’” she said. “But then I realized, the times we live in are really bad. I can’t be sarcastic anymore. I ripped the last line from my piece and took ‘Love Always Wins’ to the march at D.C. I think love is so powerful it can conquer anything.”  Follow “Love Across the USA” on Facebook to keep updated with Olek’s work and volunteer in your hometown. You can also email LoveAcrossTheUSA@gmail.com to get involved.  Welcome to Battleground, where art and activism meet."

It might seem like the leader of the free world has a full plate ― what with people questioning the future of health care, the former FBI Director James Comey’s firing and the general state of infrastructure in the U.S., to name just a few concerns ― but no. Somehow, he still has time to tweet about public enemy No. 1 Rosie O’Donnell AND flex his seemingly obscure idiom skills in yet another reference to his defeat of Hillary Clinton.

I think ""laughing up their sleeves"" sounded better in the original Russian https://t.co/Ub4lHjjU2t I guess ""laughing up their sleeves"" is a Russian expression that doesn't translate well to English https://t.co/eRsIobGVVn WYD?The usual: standing among bushes, laughing up my sleeves @realDonaldTrump ""Laughing up their sleeves""????Probably sounds better in the original Russian because no American has ever used this phrase. We all chuckled but we all also excused ourselves to somewhere private to try laughing up our sleeves in search of some recognizable act He was laughing up his sleeve so bigly he choked like a dog, it was unbelievable, nobody had ever done it before. Believe me. RuSsiA MuST bE lAugHInG uP ThEiR SLeEveS pic.twitter.com/TuLUuxKStC Spotted in the Oval yesterday: Russians ""laughing up their sleeves"" pic.twitter.com/f7v6jtcjjw The particular assortment of word salad is actually a real phrase, though. According to Merriam-Webster, universal guardian of language, it means “to be secretly happy about or amused by something (such as someone else’s trouble).” Oxford Dictionaries concurs, defining it as being “secretly or inwardly amused.” It sounds like a perfect idiom for Trump’s America, to be honest. Who, these days, isn’t laughing up their sleeves about one thing or another? Take, for example, Merriam-Webster’s use of the phrase in a sentence: “The mayor’s critics were laughing up their sleeves when news of the scandal was first reported.”  Tweaked slightly it becomes: “Hillary Clinton was laughing up her sleeve when Donald Trump first won the GOP nomination.”  Yeah, we enter it. https://t.co/3vvrAEFBHu So, while you might have become accustomed to guffawing at the 140-character declarations slung by our commander-in-chief, this one’s real. The dictionary-in-chief has spoken."
ARTS & CULTURE,"Tina Fey Confirms That Unlike 'Fetch,' The 'Mean Girls' Musical Is Going To Happen","Tina Fey stopped by “The Tonight Show” with Jimmy Fallon on Wednesday night, where she confirmed that the highly anticipated stage production of “Mean Girls,” the musical, is indeed happening. What’s more, it’s headed to Broadway. The musical is based on the iconic 2004 film of the same name, which follows a high school clique of popular girls as they welcome fresh meat a new student into their coveted coterie. Fey, who wrote the film’s screenplay and starred in it as Ms. Norbury, also adapted the movie for the stage. Fey’s husband, Emmy-winning composer Jeff Richmond, wrote the music, and Tony Award-nominee Nell Benjamin wrote the lyrics.  Fey told Fallon that the the show has been cast and the actors have been rehearsing for the past month. The level of talent, she ensured, is first-rate. Specifically, Fey described the cast as a bunch of “Baby Timberlakes,” which seems like an appropriately dated metaphor given the subject matter.  “Mean Girls” is slated to premiere at the National Theatre in Washington, D.C., on Halloween night, where it will run until Dec. 3. Fey also noted that the venue is located mere blocks from the White House, adding: “If you work there and get fired, come down, see the show. Twenty-five percent off if you got fired that day.” For all non-White House employees, tickets for D.C. shows are available here. Next stop, Broadway! "
ARTS & CULTURE,Richard Ford On His New Memoir And The Challenge Of Writing About The South,"The preteens and teenagers in Richard Ford’s fiction are captivated ― if perplexed ― by their parents’ choices. A 15-year-old drifts around in search of his twin after his parents are arrested for robbing a bank. An even younger boy witnesses a domestic spat just before his mother flees from his life.  Like his protagonists, Ford is taken with the task of understanding his parents. His most recent book, Between Them, is not a fictional exploration of that particular family dynamic, but a pair of memoirs, one dedicated to his father, who died when Ford was 16, and one to his mother. “Hardly an hour goes by on any day that I do not think something about my father,” he writes of Parker Ford, a hardworking traveling salesman forced to stay still after a major heart attack. Of his mother, Edna Akin, he writes, “The act of considering my mother’s life is an act of love.”  Of the pair and his relationship with them: “Our parents intimately link us, closeted as we are in our own lives, to a thing we’re not, forging a joined separateness and a useful mystery, so that even together with them we are also alone.” This sort of matter-of-fact observation is what Ford has come to be known for, and accounts for his categorization as a writer of “dirty realism,” alongside Raymond Carver, Tobias Wolff and Cormac McCarthy. The style lends itself well to memoiristic writing, where analysis of one’s own life runs the risk of slipping into sentimentality. That’s not the case for Ford; by describing the details of his parents’ lives, and describing what he failed to ever learn about them, he gracefully pays them tribute.  Below, the author discusses the challenges of memoir-writing and his own Southern upbringing: Is this your story, your parent’s story, or something of both? Their story. It’s their story. It’s not my story at all. I mean, I get to tell it because I’m the only one who knows it. I’m the only person left alive who knew my parents. And so it’s inescapable if I want to testify to their experience that I be the person who tells it. I wasn’t obsessively trying to keep myself out of it, but I never imagined it as being my story, or that their importance as two people owed itself to me in any way.  How did the writing process differ for you, between writing fiction and writing these short memoirs? Well, it was sort of a sensate difference, in that it seems starker to write about my parents because it all depended on the factual rudiments of their lives. So it seemed a little grainier, whereas writing fiction for me, which I’ve done for most of my life, has kind of a plushness to it, as if underneath the surface there’s a volume. And with any kind of nonfiction writing that depends on facts entirely, there is not that plushness. Even when I was provisionally commenting on things that [my parents] did ― supposing this or supposing that ― it still seemed fastened to the mast of the book’s factual underpinning.  You’ve talked about writing and word choice as a mode of discovery ― the meaning of a sentence may change based on a desired tone or sound. How did this function for you when writing about true things rather than made-up ones?  That’s a good question, because you still do ― one still does ― write a sentence, and you come to a point at which you need a verb, or you need even an adjective. In a piece of fiction, you can choose a word without any investment in its content. Only an investment in its effect, or where it might lead the sentence. With a piece of nonfiction you still have a choice. But you have to say about the word and its use, “Is this accurate?” Accuracy is not a phenomenon in writing fiction in the same way that it is a phenomenon in writing memoir or writing nonfiction.  There are some kinds of accuracies in fiction that obtain. If you’re writing about Great Falls, Montana, you can’t say the Missouri River runs south there. There is that sort of geographical accuracy, but even that can be subject to all kinds of fantastical whims. But still, I think, that the Missouri River runs north there is kind of inescapable.  I remember one time I wrote a story for The New Yorker, and I put the address of the YWCA, and let’s say that I said that the YWCA was at 613 2nd Street NW. And the fact checker for The New Yorker called me and said, you know, the YWCA is actually at 132 2nd Street S, and I said, “That’s fine, but it doesn’t have enough syllables.” And they said, “Well, no, this is where it is.” I said, “No, just go away.” These two memoirs have some redundancies and also some contradictions. Why did you choose to include them?  I was raised by two people, and they each had a view of things and a view of me, and I had a view of them which was not always consonant. I felt like if I tried to make everything completely add up, it would renounce something true about the book.  Books are written by human beings. I knew that I was leaving some things inconsistent, and I was willing to do that for the sake of a certain kind of accuracy. But also, I wasn’t there. I was there after 1944, but I wasn’t there before that.  Entire paragraphs of this book are composed of strings of questions, without answers. Why did you choose to do this?  Regarding my father, since his absence was predominant in my life, it was to try to penetrate those absences, rather than just saying, “I don’t know,” which wouldn’t make much of a story. I thought that the questioning strategy for the narrator ― me ― was in and of itself interesting.  It reminds me of some of your stories.  And in Canada also. I think it’s just something that ― in the end of “Rock Springs,” when the narrator says, “Would you think he was anybody like you?” you want to give that question over to the reader in an almost conversational way.  I do it because there are certain stories in my past, that I didn’t write, but Frank O’Connor did, that seem to me to be touching and alluring, because they represent, in their first-person interrogative style, a certain kind of human impulse to understand what is otherwise not understandable. There’s a way, when you answer the questions that you pose, of gaining dominion over your life, and demonstrating that dominion. I guess that’s why. How has your Southern upbringing influenced your approach to writing? Well, I grew up down the street from Eudora Welty. I started off with the assumption that one could be a writer. You could be from where I was from and be a writer. It was something that was supported in the community.  I think also, because I grew up in a racist society, in which we were constantly being told that what wasn’t true was true, that I had a natural and have a natural skepticism about what I receive, and what I’m told. And that causes me to try to provide explanations for things that I don’t believe, and that’s a way in which fiction can operate. Fiction can be a kind of imaginative explanation of something, when the discrepancy between apparent fact and truth is too wide to believe. Even though you’re from the South, you tend to set your stories elsewhere.  Well, because everybody had written about everything I knew before I got there, and had done it better than I was going to be able to do it. If I had just let myself become a writer of the South, about Southern topics, for Southern readers, I wasn’t ever going to be a great writer, and that’s what I wanted to be. And I still do. And I had to be able to have a subject over which I was the world’s greatest expert. I was not going to be the world’s greatest expert about the South. First of all, I didn’t like the South very much, and second of all, I liked the literature that I knew about the South immoderately. Faulkner, Welty, Flannery O’Connor, Walker Percy. I thought that stuff was just great. Why did there need to be another one of them, which was all I was going to be able to be? How has your parents’ life on the road impacted you as a writer? I know in the book I call them transients. And in a sense they were people who didn’t, until I was born, stay in one place very long. And so I’m on a constant quest for some new experience that I could come to know and maybe use. I just never have been comfortable feeling, “This is my home and, by god, I have to stay here.” And my parents ― my parents were both in their own way fleeing certain circumstances that obviously didn’t make them very happy. Without being miserable and malcontents, and they weren’t because they found each other at a very early age and immediately started making each other wildly happy. So when I think about where I reside, I think I reside wherever my wife is.  Do you think you’ll write more memoirs in the future, or are you more likely to return to fiction for now? I don’t think I have anything else to write in a memoiristic way. I’ve written a few essays that are kind of memoiristic. My agent, who was very taken by the character of my grandfather really would like me to write a book about him, but I don’t know what I would write. He was a force of nature sort of guy, and did as best he could to ― he was a rakish guy, a real-chaser-after women. And I’m certainly not going to write any autobiographies. As close as this memoir comes to autobiography, that’s close enough for me."
ARTS & CULTURE,Margaret Atwood Just Schooled Us All On What '1984' Is Really About,"As you turned the last page of George Orwell’s 1984, were you overwhelmed by a surge of fatalistic angst? The hero (uh, spoiler alert) has lost his quest to overthrow the totalitarian regime against which he had rebelled, and that seems to be that: No hope, no change.  Well, maybe we’ve been looking at that all wrong, Handmaid’s Tale author and speculative fiction doyenne Margaret Atwood recently told the CBC. “1984 has a coda, and the coda is a note on Newspeak, which was the language being developed to eliminate thought, making it impossible to actually think,” she points out. “The note on Newspeak at the end of 1984 is written in standard English in the past tense, which tells us that Newspeak did not persist.”  So, perhaps the tale of Oceania ends more hopefully than you thought, with the downfall of Big Brother rather than a “decisive victory”? In her own dystopian classic, Atwood revealed the fall of the authoritarian Republic of Gilead not through her heroine, Offred, winding up triumphant, but through a similar epilogue that frames Offred’s first-person account as an artifact from a failed regime ― an object of study to scholars in the more liberal society that has replaced it. Atwood has previously described the concluding 1984 essay on Newspeak as a direct influence on her own choice to end The Handmaid’s Tale with an academic epilogue, though the essay is typically read as an appendix rather than as the conclusion to the novel. “The essay on Newspeak is written in standard English, in the third person, and in the past tense, which can only mean that the regime has fallen, and that language and individuality have survived,” she wrote in The Guardian in 2003. “For whoever has written the essay on Newspeak, the world of Nineteen Eighty-Four is over. Thus, it’s my view that Orwell had much more faith in the resilience of the human spirit than he’s usually been given credit for.” From a rather practical standpoint, Atwood explained to CBC, “Doom and gloom all the way through is not motivating to people. If we’re all going to go swirling down the plug hole, why make any effort, why not just stay in bed all day or party?” By revealing that freedom and justice will eventually triumph, the dystopian author offers us motivation to fight. The reassurance that totalitarianism is unsustainable may reassure some in the current political climate ― though it’s worth remembering the often lengthy time-frame, and the casualties. In Y.A. dystopian sagas, readers can follow along as the protagonists singlehandedly dismantle a crushing regime (Harry Potter, The Hunger Games) or at least nobly die while putting the final cracks in it, all by the age of 18. After the 2016 election, many liberals took solace in comparing opposition to Donald Trump to Harry Potter’s fight against Lord Voldemort, a dramatic yet pacifying narrative in which an oppressive government is overthrown by a single hero. More realistically, books like 1984 and Handmaid’s Tale focus on the midst of the struggle, on resistance fighters who fail and are forgotten. Offred and 1984’s Winston Smith may see the promised land, but they won’t enter into it. That may not seem like cause for optimism, but it seems in dystopia, optimism is all a question of perspective."
ARTS & CULTURE,'Grace And Frankie' Actress Writing A Book To Help Women Run For Office,"The Nov. 8 election has already inspired a tsunami-sized wave of aspiring women politicians. An upcoming book from “Grace and Frankie” actress June Diane Raphael and Emily’s List Chief of Staff Kate Black aims to help them run ― and win. The friends will collaborate on The Badass Woman’s Guide to Running for Office and Changing the World, People reported Wednesday, a sort of “workbook/planner.” The finished product, set for a 2019 debut, will “reveal the basics of what a woman needs to know to run for office, whether it’s on the local, state, or federal level,” according to a statement from publisher Workman. “We can’t look at another photo of a bunch of older white dudes making decisions about women,” Raphael told People, explaining her inspiration for the project with Emily’s List, an organization that helps pro-choice Democratic women candidates run for office. Perhaps the actress was thinking of this moment in recent history, when President Donald Trump gathered a room full of men to discuss maternity coverage in the planned American Health Care Act: Appreciated joining @POTUS for meeting with the Freedom Caucus again today. This is it. #PassTheBill pic.twitter.com/XG6lQIy5a6 Viral moments aside, Raphael cited a basic statistic about American government that she called “haunting”: Women make up less than 20 percent of Congress (19.4 percent, to be precise) and less than 25 percent of state legislatures (24.8 percent, at the moment). As HuffPost’s Emma Gray reported in December, women and men have a roughly equal shot at winning an election. The trouble is that fewer women actually run for office ― an issue Raphael and Black aim to help solve. The Badass Women’s Guide comes as support for women’s campaigns for office has increased amid seemingly unprecedented numbers of women activists participating in marches across the U.S. One art exhibit, “She Inspires,” currently on view at New York’s Untitled Space gallery, is donating 10 percent of its proceeds to She Should Run, a nonpartisan organization that supports women running for office. The need for funding is real: An Emily’s List representative told The Washington Post last month that the organization had spoken with 11,000 women about running for office throughout all 50 states, including some prospective House candidates."
ARTS & CULTURE,"Young New Yorkers, Street Artists, and Keeping Teens Out of Jail","The  Street Art community donates time and art to a program that keeps teens  out of jail in New York. An annual auction overflows with work by today’s Street Artists. With the precision indicative of her architect training Rachel Barnard describes the art/criminal justice project for youth that she founded five years ago – which keeps growing thanks to artists’ help, community involvement, and an evermore engaged criminal justice system. “Alternative Diversion,” she calls it, this court-mandated art program that prosecutors can offer to New York teens as a sentencing option instead of incarceration or doing community service. “What we’re talking about here are 16 and 17 year-olds in Brooklyn who have been arrested for things like jumping the (subway) turnstyle or having a  small amount of marijuana on them or petty larceny,” Barnard explains in a new video for YNY. “Say you get a misdemeanor record at 16,” she says, “What that means is that you’re less likely to get employment, even though you are more likely to be poor and need employment more than most other 16 year-olds.” Each year the programs called Young New Yorkers (YNY), which Barnard founded, work directly with these youth to redirect their route in life, to provide guidance, foster self-analyzation and to set productive goals for the future. To  some observers it may sound ironic that Street Artists, many of whom have done illegal artworks on walls throughout New York City, are the principal artists pool who are donating their time and talent here to the fundraising auction in lower Manhattan. With high profile names like Shepard Fairey, Daze, Dan Witz, the Guerrilla Girls and Kara Walker on this years list of artists donating to the  auction, the program boasts a cross section of established and emerging Street Artists, graffiti artists, culture jammers and truth tellers who  heartily support this program that since 2012 has given more than 400  city youth a second chance. But then we think more about the history and psychological/anthropological  makeup of the Street Art scene and it makes perfect sense: What segment of the arts community has such a rich history of activism, self-directed industry, challenging the norms of society, using public space for intervention – and a penchant for consciousness-raising?  Even after 50 plus years of youth culture in love with graffiti and Street Art these artists and their practice are seen as outside the proper curriculum of many universities with art programs and museums have arduous internal debates about supporting exhibitions that are dedicated  to Street Art and graffiti specifically.  This is precisely the kind of marginalized movement/ subculture that has necessarily thrived often with little encouragement or funding –  overcoming the barriers to success that more institutionally recognized art movements don’t encounter. In fact, many have gone to jail for what they do. Uniquely, Young New Yorkers continues to build its partnerships with artists, teachers, lawyers, volunteers and several agencies within the criminal  justice system, including criminal and community courts, the District Attorney’s Office and the Legal Aid Society. The program’s art shows mounted by graduates are frequently attended by members of the justice system as well and art becomes a facilitator of strengthened community ties. BSA has supported YNY every year since its first auction benefit and this year is no exception. Please go to Paddle 8 to see the items for sale or better yet, go to the auction in person. We stopped by while they were hanging the show yesterday and we were able to take a few shots for you to see what’s up for grabs.

ARTS & CULTURE,Milo Yiannopoulos Claims He Will Sue Simon & Schuster And Self-Publish His Book,"Milo Yiannopoulos claims he will self-publish his book Dangerous after his comments about pedophilia forced publishing giant Simon & Schuster to drop its deal with the alt-right figure. He announced the news late last month over Facebook. In a separate message posted Saturday, Yiannopoulos stated he plans to sue the publisher for $10 million to “send a message.” “We are going to make publishers, professors and journalists who threaten free speech famous ― and ashamed,” he wrote. The former Breitbart editor said Dangerous will be the first project under his new umbrella, Dangerous Books, an endeavor made for those whose work might otherwise be determined unpublishable.  (Bear in mind: Even President Donald Trump’s last book, titled Great Again: How to Fix Crippled America, was deemed publishable by a major imprint.) His original deal with Simon & Schuster was canceled in February. Although Yiannopoulos has a history of controversial comments ― he once equated feminism to “cancer” and led the charge on the racist, troll-fueled harassment of comedian Leslie Jones over Twitter ― it wasn’t until he made a comment seemingly condoning pedophilia that the publisher pulled the plug.  He lost a major speaking gig, and his job at Breitbart, the same week.  “This will not defeat me,” Yiannopoulos said at the time. Shortly after, HuffPost observed that, while his message had been invalidated by trusted outlets, the controversial character would likely self-publish his work anyway. Now, he’s announced just that. Self-publishing is a popular route for writers who are unable to find a traditional home for their books. But the market is “challenging,” Mark Coker, founder of ebook distributor Smashwords, said in a January interview with Publisher’s Weekly, due to the “flood of titles that have entered the ebook space.” Yiannopoulos said he will release Dangerous after touring campuses under Milo, Inc., a new media venture centered on live events. The self-proclaimed supporter of free speech said in a statement that he will focus on “making the lives of journalists, professors, politicians, feminists, Black Lives Matter activists, and other professional victims a living hell.”  The First Amendment, of course, protects the freedom of speech, but also the freedom of the press. According to Vanity Fair, Yiannopoulos claims to be supported by a $12 million investment from anonymous backers. And, he says he personally has access to “all the funniest, smartest, most interesting young YouTubers.” “I’m going to be actively hunting around for the next Milo,” he said. “The generation that’s coming up [...] They love us. They love me.” "
ARTS & CULTURE,Flying Pigs Will Block Trump Tower For One Glorious Day This Summer,"Many Americans would have imagined that reality TV star Donald Trump would become the President of the United States on the day pigs fly. Well, Trump is the president. And thanks to an upcoming project by Chicago-based architectural firm /nwdarchitects.com/""}}"" data-beacon-parsed=""true"">New World Design Ltd., for one day this summer, pigs will fly. The firm, led by Jeffrey Roberts, plans to install four gold pig balloons in front of the facade of Trump Tower, for a one-day public installation titled “Flying Pigs On Parade.” Four golden swine balloons will float in mid-air, effectively concealing Trump’s name from public view. The goal is to provide passersby a brief yet glorious reprieve from seeing the omnipresent name of you-know-who, thus continuing to resist his normalization at all costs.  Visually, the installation is inspired by the album art for Pink Floyd’s 1977 “Animals,” which itself is a tribute to George Orwell’s Animal Farm. The 1945 allegory and classic middle school read follows a barn full of farm animals to symbolize a totalitarian dictatorship built upon a cult of personality ― a scenario bearing some alarming similarities to our current political state.  Roberts’ vision incorporates elements of Pink Floyd and George Orwell with a few additional digs at our nation’s leader. As he explained in a statement: “The references are many, from flying pigs and Miss Piggy comments to a taste for gold embellished interiors. Ultimately, this is a very rational design and is in direct contrast to the chaotic nature and bizarre antics of our current leadership.” Roberts announced his idea for the piece in November 2016, shortly after Trump won the presidency. Recently, Pink Floyd’s Roger Waters himself approved the idea, a necessity since the musician owns the image rights to his 1977 album cover. Now Roberts’ final challenge, aside from actually building the four 30-by-15-foot golden pig balloons, is fundraising. The architects are currently collecting donations to help pay for costs including balloon fabrication, technical specialists, barge rental, rigging, prep costs, security and permitting fees. If interested, you can donate here.  Roberts has not yet confirmed when his piece will be installed, but hopes that pigs will fly (for one day only) come late summer. The goal is to then take the pigs on the road, traveling from city to city, blocking other Trump Tower facades one day at a time. That’ll do, pigs, that’ll do. "
ARTS & CULTURE,Banksy Unveils Brexit-Inspired Mural Showing Dismantling Of EU Flag,"Elusive British street artist Banksy has unveiled his latest artwork, one that depicts the dismantling of the European Union’s flag. The massive blue and yellow mural appeared overnight in Dover, England on Sunday. The site is near a major ferry terminal that connects the U.K. with mainland Europe. A post shared by Banksy (@banksy) on May 7, 2017 at 6:44am PDT Representatives for the artist, whose identity is not publicly known, confirmed to Reuters that it is by Banksy, whose verified Instagram account shared photos of the work. In the painting, a worker is seen chipping away at one of the flag’s 12 stars, which are said to “stand for the ideals of unity, solidarity and harmony among the peoples of Europe,” according to the EU’s website. “The number of stars has nothing to do with the number of member countries, though the circle is a symbol of unity,” the website states.  Dover, England. A post shared by Banksy (@banksy) on May 7, 2017 at 6:40am PDT The painting comes nearly a year after the United Kingdom voted to leave the EU, in a vote commonly known as “Brexit.” It also appeared the same day that France held its presidential elections. Far-right contender Marine Le Pen, who lost to independent moderate Emmanuel Macron, had promised to seek a similar exit from the EU if elected. British tabloid, The Sun, which campaigned to leave the EU, beamed a sign reading “Dover & Out” last month over Dover’s white cliffs that greet ferry passengers. It appeared the same day that British Prime Minister Theresa May began the process of formally withdrawing the U.K. from the EU."
ARTS & CULTURE,Ivanka Trump's Book Uses Toni Morrison Quote To Equate Busyness With Slavery,"One of the less brutal reviews of Ivanka Trump’s book Women Who Work: Rewriting the Rules for Success, penned by The/www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/books/review-ivanka-trump-women-who-work.html""}}"" data-beacon-parsed=""true""> New York Times’ Jennifer Senior, described it as “a strawberry milkshake of inspirational quotes.” Indeed, Trump does begin each chapter with a snippet of wisdom from a woman she, presumably, admires. Each is scrawled in darling, lopsided letters on a pink notecard, resembling a throw pillow more than a page in an actual book. Beneath every quote, Trump honors the intelligence and resilience of the featured writer with the thoughtful commentary #ITWISEWORDS.  This recipe ― which /www.npr.org/2017/05/03/526558242/everything-you-need-to-know-about-ivanka-trump-s-new-book-without-actually-readi""}}"" data-beacon-parsed=""true"">NPR’s Danielle Kurtzleben accurately described as possessing “the aesthetic of a Pinterest board” more than a career guide ― is vapid and irritating enough. But some of the quotations Trump elects to include, particularly one from Toni Morrison, reveal the staggering extent of Trump’s privilege, entitlement and ignorance.  The quote above comes from Toni Morrison’s Pulitzer Prize-winning 1987 novel Beloved, which, inspired by a true story, brings to light the odious ways slavery ripped apart black families through the lens of a mother trying to save her children from its horrors, and the ghastly lengths she endured to do so.  The story follows a mother and escaped slave named Sethe who, upon being discovered by her master, attempts to kill her children to prevent them from being subjected to the barbarity of life on a plantation. Sethe succeeds only in killing her 2-year-old daughter by cutting her neck with a saw. The daughter’s ghost returns to haunt Sethe’s home years later, which is where the story begins. “Bit by bit ... she had reclaimed herself,” Trump quotes Morrison as saying. “Freeing yourself was one thing; claiming ownership of that freed self was another.” While Morrison’s words reference the experience of liberation after being the literal property of another human being, Trump updates the phrase to address the modern dilemma of spending too much time on one’s phone.  “Are you a slave to your time or the master of it?” Trump asks, seriously using the words slave and master, while quoting Toni Morrison, to talk about time management. “Despite your best intentions, it’s easy to be reactive and get caught up in returning calls, attending meetings, answering e-mails...” This is not the only moment in the book Trump appropriates the words of others with no consideration or respect for those words’ context and weight. She quotes poet and civil rights activist Maya Angelou while discussing negotiating for a raise.  So far, at least one woman quoted in Trump’s book has spoken out with some skepticism about her citation: legendary primatologist Jane Goodall. Her quote, as featured by Trump, reads: “What you do makes a difference, and you have to decide what kind of difference you want to make.” In an interview with CNN, Goodall said she “sincerely” hopes Trump “will take the full import of my words to heart. She is in a position to do much good or terrible harm.” Unfortunately, because of the tasteless manner in which Trump has sprinkled the words of others throughout her book like glorified palate cleansers, stripping them of their original context and urgency, it doesn’t seem like she has taken any of the messages to heart. "
ARTS & CULTURE,Nazi-Looted Libraries: Items Must Be Returned To Owners And Heirs,"How did tens of thousands of books stolen by the Nazis from Jewish families and institutions end up, among other places, in the Former Soviet Union? It’s a mystery with more questions than answers, but one thing is certain – these items should be returned to their rightful heirs and owners whenever possible. As part of the Final Solution, the Nazis confiscated and amassed a vast collection consisting of entire libraries, Judaica, and art which was brought to Germany. Millions of objects were taken and, after the war, many of these items became ensconced and remain in archives, libraries, museums, and other cultural institutions throughout Europe. In recent years, the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany (Claims Conference), together with the World Jewish Restitution Organization (WJRO), created the Looted Art & Cultural Property Initiative, to work with governments and Jewish communities around the world to encourage provenance research – that is, ascertaining the historical ownership – of items plundered and lost during the Holocaust. Over the past decade, this program has done an enormous amount of work researching the original records of the “Special Task Force” ― known as the Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg (ERR) – a Nazi agency that looted cultural valuables from occupied countries. The ERR targeted major libraries of Jewish individuals and institutions, along with other libraries belonging to groups or individuals designated as enemies of the Reich. Due to the work of the Looted Art & Cultural Property Initiative, many records containing lists of Jewish-owned art, book and cultural property which was plundered during the Holocaust have become public for the first time. Thanks to the tireless and invaluable research efforts of Wesley Fisher, Director of Research at the Claims Conference, and his team, we now have a detailed account of items that the ERR looted from libraries in France; we know which organizations were targeted for looting, and where these books were sent. This program will be replicated for Belgian libraries, as well as for the Netherlands and other countries. The task is to ascertain what was taken and from whom. According to Wesley, “Books can hold clear clues as to their rightful owners: a bookplate, a stamp imprint from a particular institution, or even a hand-written dedication on the flyleaf can all help to discover from where a book came.” Last autumn, the team traveled to Minsk, the capital of Belarus, where many of the books stolen from France eventually ended up.  At the end of the war, the Soviets, using the “Soviet Trophy Brigades,” brought millions of the looted objects to Moscow, but mystery still surrounds why these French books were taken to Minsk, as opposed to Moscow, where most of the books ultimately landed.   Evidence of their presence in the National Library of Belarus is now available. A list of the individuals and institutions in France from which the books and collections were seized – along with evidence of their current locations – has been compiled.  One of the books belonged to a Jewish Frenchman named Victor Basch who, along with his wife, was murdered in 1944 by the French Vichy government. This book, which included a personal dedication to Victo0r by the author, was found in the French National Library. And last month, at a special conference on looted books at the National Library in Paris, this volume was restituted to Francoise Basch, Victor Basch’s granddaughter and a Shoah survivor, as a gesture of goodwill. How did Victor’s book find its way to the National Library of France? Quite possibly, it may have been among those books that were repatriated to France after the war and sent to the national library. But there’s no way to know for certain. While to most the book itself is not valuable, to the family it is precious, if not priceless. Wesley noted that Francoise’s emotion was palpable, as she weeped when receiving a book belonging to her grandfather. The Looted Art & Cultural Property Initiative will continue to sponsor projects to make Nazi records publicly accessible, in the hope that the light of justice will find its way to finally return these stolen items to their rightful owners. Returning Judaica, artwork and books, seized during the Holocaust to rightful owners or heirs is of the utmost importance. Such items certainly should not remain lost or buried among concealed stacks of books in libraries in the Former Soviet Union, or anywhere else for that matter."
ARTS & CULTURE,The Gallery Trying To Get Women Artists Paid,"“Women artists have always been sidelined,” Bianca Chu, deputy director at Sotheby’s S|2 Gallery, told HuffPost.  Her opinion is hardly unfounded. Over the years, there have been widespread efforts by feminist activists to address the ongoing gender imbalance in the museum and gallery worlds, imploring individuals and institutions to learn more women artists’ names, put more women’s work in galleries and museums, and document more women’s contributions to art on Wikipedia and in history books.  Chu and the team at London’s S|2 Gallery are working to address one imbalance in particular: market value. The gallery, a space adjacent to Sotheby’s auction house in London, is launching a series of exhibitions featuring the work of female artists who are historically influential, yet remain undervalued for a variety of reasons.  For the first show in this vein, S|2 is showing the work of Renate Bertlmann and Maria Lassnig, two postwar artists from Austria whose reputations and market costs don’t add up. Bertlmann, born in Vienna in 1943, is an avant-garde feminist artist whose work incorporated dildos, pacifiers and condoms to defuse what she referred to as the “phallocracy.” In one series, Bertlmann paints phalluses as pastel-colored cartoons donning corsets and garter belts. Throughout her career, Bertlmann depicted penises in many forms over and over again, each time chipping away at the unspoken patriarchal power possessed within them.  “Pornographic jokes have always been a male domain, made at the exclusive expense of women,” Bertlmann said in an interview with the Tate museum in London. “I consider my series of objects an accomplished example of an obscene female joke. This joke has hit home; it targets the deadly serious, male sexual arrogance.” When Bertlmann began exhibiting her work in the 1970s, she was criticized by other feminist artists for her obsession with phallic imagery. “People thought that because she was using phalluses in such a direct way she was empowering them,” Chu said. “But really, by using them so bluntly, she was trying to overcome them.” In another iconic work, Bertlmann covers a mask with the tips of baby pacifiers, which bear resemblance to nipples and condoms, both of which were, again, frequent materials in her work. In a series of staged photos, Bertlmann wears the mask atop her face, covering her fingers with condoms. The monstrous image visualizes woman as baby-making machine, her physical features buried beneath the responsibilities of sexually accommodation and reproduction.  The other artist on view is Maria Lassnig, who was born in 1919 in Kappel am Krappfeld, a small town in southern Austria. For 70 years, Lassnig painted only herself, assuming a variety of disguises including a baby, a cheese grater, a monster and a dumpling.  The artist described her gripping self-portraits as “body-awareness paintings” ― in that they reflected as much as possible how she was feeling at the moment of their creation. She never painted from photographs, always from life. “I need the real body, real air,” she is quoted as saying in The Guardian. “When I paint I want everything to be as direct as possible.” Lassnig’s depictions range from figurative to abstract, naturalistic to teetering on the edge of reality, her flesh shifting from salmon pink to electric green ― all dependent on the artist’s inner state at the time of the images’ creation.  In her most well-known work, 2005’s “You or Me,” Lassnig paints her unclothed, 85-year-old body, the flesh yellowy and loose. Her face appears vacant yet alarmed. With one hand, Lassnig holds a gun to her head; she points another gun at the viewer with the other. The portrait is painful to look at yet impossible to look away from, as if warning the viewer that if she breaks eye contact Lassnig will shoot.  “She has been active since the 1950s,” Chu explained, “but it’s only in the last decade or so that she’s had major museum retrospectives outside of her own country.” Lassnig was awarded the Golden Lion lifetime achievement award at the Venice Biennale in 2013 and died the next year, at 94 years old.  Despite the critical recognition she’s received, her work is still priced in an entirely different bracket than, say, Francis Bacon’s, with whom she exhibited (and held her own) in 2016. While Bacon’s work has sold for up to $142 million, Lassnig’s record, according to Chu, hovers around $600,000.  The first round of S|2 Gallery’s programming focuses on women artists, but future shows will explore work that is undervalued for a variety of reasons. Chu stressed that the exhibitions will place more emphasis on the artist’s work as opposed to the explanations behind their exclusion. “Certain artists have been marginalized because of gender or race, but we are more interested in their rediscovery,” Chu said. “There are always a variety of factors, but we’re focusing on the art they are making.”  The time is ripe for serious attention to be paid to artists as groundbreaking as Bertlmann and Lassnig. And if those auction prices go up as a result, all the better.  Renate Bertlmann’s work is on view now in S|2 Gallery’s lower gallery, and Maria Lassnig’s in the upper gallery. The London show is on view until June 1. "
ARTS & CULTURE,"Solid Gold, Life-Size Darth Vader Mask On Sale For $1.4 Million","The WTF is strong with this one. A jeweler in Tokyo, Japan, is selling a life-size Darth Vader mask made of 24-karat gold for the bargain price of $1.4 million (154 million yen), The Associated Press reported. On Tuesday, jeweler Ginza Tanaka unveiled the glitzy helmet and announced it would go on sale on May 4 to celebrate the 40th anniversary of “Star Wars: A New Hope.” It took a total of 10 goldsmiths three months to craft and assemble the ultimate “Star Wars” trophy, per the outlet. The helmet is 10.4 inches wide, 11.8 inches tall and weighs 33 pounds. Unfortunately, due to its weight, the mask is too heavy to wear. And if you don’t have the money for this gilded paperweight piece of memorabilia, the jeweler has also made commemorative “Star Wars” coins that are a tad more affordable. The coins come in sets of three that sell for about $11,000 a pop, The New York Times reported. If you’re interested in these coins, you have to act fast. Ginza Tanaka has only 77 sets, a number that the jeweler says is an homage to 1977, the year that “A New Hope” was released. We guess it’s time to bust open that change jar-Jar."
ARTS & CULTURE,'Harry Potter and the Cursed Child' Is Officially Coming To Broadway Next Spring,"“Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,” the next chapter of our Hogwarts friends’ stories, opened as a play in London last summer. As the first full Potter-related story since 2007’s Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows, fans eagerly awaited the production’s debut, which was met by positive reviews from British theater critics. And now, the award-winning production is coming to Broadway.  Earlier today, Harry Potter Theatrical Productions announced that the play will be performed stateside beginning in April 2018 at New York City’s Lyric Theatre. Tickets will go on sale this fall, but the total wait time to see Harry and co. on stage will be almost a year. Sorry, Potterheads. The play’s story is set 19 years after Rowling’s seventh book in the “Potter” series, in which Harry and the Order of the Phoenix triumph over Voldemort’s army. Now, Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny have children of their own, and those children are readying themselves to set off for Hogwarts. The original cast included Jamie Parker as Harry Potter, Noma Dumezweni as Hermione Granger-Weasley, and Cherrelle Skeete as Rose Granger-Weasley. The decision to cast actresses of color in the roles of Hermione and Rose drew criticism with fans, citing adherence to canon as their objection. But, as HuffPost reporter Claire Fallon pointed out last summer, these outcries were primarily about race, not accuracy to the original stories.  According to the “Cursed Child” press release, casting for the U.S. production of the play “will be announced in the coming months.” (Auditions for the Broadway play were held last February.) The good news is, if you’d like to brush up on the story ― which was released in book format, but not as a novelization, by Scholastic last summer ― you have plenty of time."
ARTS & CULTURE,The Worst Dressed Person At The Met Gala Was Actually This Naked Artist In A Box,"Over the past 24 hours, the internet has collectively spent way too much time debating which celebrities were the best and worst dressed at Monday’s 2017 Met Gala.  While stars like Gigi Hadid and Kylie Jenner got flak for their not-so-Comme des Garçons-inspired looks, no one was more underdressed for the occasion than Russian performance artist Fyodor Pavlov-Andreevich, who showed up nude inside a glass box.  Around 8:30 p.m. ET, Pavlov-Andreevich (in box) was dragged out of the trunk of a car and placed on the floor of the highly exclusive affair, his six-foot-two frame obscured only by the condensation clouding up box’s glass panels. Immediately, Met Gala partygoers were confused, uncomfortable and a little giggly.  It was not long before police showed up and requested Pavlov-Andreevich leave his box. When the artist refused, firefighters cut him free from his enclosure and promptly arrested him on charges of public lewdness, obstructing governmental administration, criminal trespassing and disorderly conduct, according to NBC New York. There is a naked guy in a transparent box at #metgala. Coppers flyIng above and a fire truck In a Facebook post from the artist’s account, his friends kept interested parties updated with Pavlov-Andreevich’s whereabouts, eventually alerting followers that he was released from custody and scheduled for a court hearing on June 5. The box, the post added, was “arrested,” as well.  Pavlov-Andreevich has pulled stunts like this before ― at least four times before, to be precise. Showing up places naked in a box is an ongoing guerrilla performance piece the artist has dubbed “Foundling.” And yes, he is represented by a gallery.  Previous sites of “Foundling” happenings include the Venice Biennale, the Garage Museum of Contemporary Art in Moscow, Christie’s Vanity Fair party in London and the São Paulo Biennale. So rest assured, this artist gets around. Accounts of all four prior performances are documented in full on his website.  See the whole thing go down in this video below, shared on Pavlov-Andreevich’s Facebook.  H/T artnet News."
ARTS & CULTURE,J. K. Rowling Magically Trolls Donald Trump For Tweeting In The Third Person,"J. K. Rowling just couldn’t resist. The Harry Potter author gleefully mocked President Donald Trump after he tweeted the following message in the third person on Tuesday: ...Trump/Russia story was an excuse used by the Democrats as justification for losing the election. Perhaps Trump just ran a great campaign? Here’s how Rowling responded: I wonder whether Trump talks to Trumpself in the third Trumperson when Trump's alone. https://t.co/8CEzVTJjBq Trump often refers to himself by his surname, rather than by using the words “me” and “I.” It’s a habit that Harvard Medical School professor Elsa Ronningstam says people with “an exaggerated view of how great” they are sometimes use to make themselves appear even bigger. Trump’s tweet and Rowling’s retort did not go unnoticed by other Twitter users, who seized on the posts to also poke fun at the president. @jk_rowling Trumpdiculous, Trump talks perfect Trumpish when around other Human Trumples @jk_rowling Trump tired.

ARTS & CULTURE,Hillary Clinton Borrows 'Handmaid's Tale' Resistance Slogan In Planned Parenthood Speech,"Hillary Clinton can admit The Handmaid’s Tale feels a bit more relevant now, too. In a speech to celebrate Planned Parenthood’s 100th anniversary Tuesday night, the former Secretary of State recalled a phrase from Margaret Atwood’s dystopian feminist classic. A politely sanitized version, that is. The protagonist Offred, whose name comes from “of Fred” to indicate her subservience to the commander of her household, is comforted in the novel by a phrase she finds secretly carved in her room: “Nolite te bastardes carborundorum.” The book documents life in a new militant theocracy on the grounds of what used to be the United States, where Offred is routinely raped in her role as a surrogate for an elite couple. From the Latin, she finds an English translation: “Don’t let the bastards grind you down.” “To paraphrase Margaret Atwood, ‘We can never let them grind us down,’” Clinton said, after recalling her own relationship with the 1985 novel. “We come tonight to celebrate the last 100 years, the progress that so many generations have fought so hard for,” Clinton said at the Planned Parenthood event. “What a time it is to be holding this centennial. Just ask those who’ve been watching The Handmaid’s Tale, a book I read and was captivated by years ago.” She was careful not to raise too many eyebrows.  “Now, I am not suggestion this dystopian future is around the corner,” Clinton continued, “but this show has prompted important conversations about women’s rights and autonomy. In ‘The Handmaid’s Tale,’ women’s rights are gradually, slowly stripped away. As one character says, ‘We didn’t look up from our phones until it was too late.’” “It is not too late for us,” Clinton assured, so long as supporters of women’s rights “keep fighting.” “Progress is never fully won. It has to be renewed generation after generation. We stand on the shoulders of the women and men who came before us, and march alongside young activists who are leading the way forward.” In addition to renewed popularity in libraries and book clubs, The Handmaid’s Tale has been recently adapted into a Hulu series starring Elisabeth Moss, which is available through the streaming service now. In light of its debut, a steady stream of writers have drawn parallels between the book and current events; topics surrounding women’s rights and health have been thrust into international spotlight as a man who once boasted about sexually assaulting women became America’s 45th president. The author herself has chimed in more than once about her work’s lasting importance, stating in a Time interview that she “made nothing up,” despite the novel’s seemingly unthinkable picture of misogyny. “The control of women and babies has been a part of every repressive regime in history,” Atwood recently told the outlet. Planned Parenthood has been under threat by the administration of President Donald Trump, who last month signed a resolution allowing individual states to withdraw funding from the women’s health care provider. To many, Trump’s administration presents a threat to women’s health, a view cemented in March when a photo circulated showing not one woman in a room where the president met with lawmakers to discuss maternity care. This week, Trump appointed an anti-contraception advocate, Teresa Manning, to a top spot within a federal family planning program. Planned Parenthood funding reportedly may also face cuts in a Republican health care bill currently in the works."
ARTS & CULTURE,'The Handmaid’s Tale' Is Already Locked In For A Second Season,"Just one week after its three-episode premiere, Hulu’s adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s “The Handmaid’s Tale” has already been renewed for a second season, according to The Hollywood Reporter. The outlet notes that the show is Hulu’s most-streamed premiere to date; and it’s been a critical success, too, racking up a 92 percent rating on Metacritic.  In an interview with HuffPost last week, showrunner Bruce Miller said that the story’s themes, though timeless, were sure to resonate with contemporary viewers. He said the show will lead fans to “appreciate the freedoms that we have, and see little ways that they’re chipped away and what that can lead to.” In addition to its at least two-season run, the show has Elisabeth Moss signed on for a five-to-seven-year contract, a commitment she made with the condition of working as a producer, with a say in casting decisions.  So, how will a multi-season adaptation of a single novel play out? On a panel at the Tribeca Film Festival, Miller noted that while one of the book’s merits is its close focus on Offred’s personal story, that also means there’s room to explore the world beyond her perspective.  “I wanted to know what happens next,” he said of the novel’s abrupt ending. “The end of the book is quite a mystery, so I get to make it up.” It bodes well for future seasons that Atwood has been involved with Hulu’s take on her story, even appearing as a shadow-shrouded disciplinarian in one scene.  And, there have been possible hints at a sequel to the book, although this might be no more than wishful thinking on the part of her many avid fans. "
ARTS & CULTURE,"Those Brad Pitt Photos Aren't Just Meme-Worthy, They're Kind Of Radical","Photographer Ryan McGinley is known for his electric lo-fi images of ecstatic youth, often revolving around naked 20-somethings galavanting through the wilderness ― lighting sparklers, jumping into waterfalls, and just generally looking young and wild and free.  His most recent series, however, features a very different subject: “LA dad on a juice cleanse” Brad Pitt, who is 53 years old and rebuilding his life following a public, ugly divorce from Angelina Jolie. The spread appears in GQ Style’s Summer issue, along with an interview by Michael Paterniti about Pitt’s life since his split from Jolie in September. The photographs are set in three national parks: the Floridian swamps of the Everglades, the crystalline dunes at White Sands and the crepuscular caves of Carlsbad Caverns, the latter of which are both in New Mexico.  Since the photos appeared online this morning, the internet has banded together to revel in the strange yet undeniably magnetic images, which feature one of Hollywood’s most iconic leading men rolling around like a sad baby deer in a seemingly endless carpet of sand. Many were quick to comment on the resemblance between the pics and Terrence Malick’s films ― especially “The Tree of Life.” But there is something additionally compelling about the series, something we rarely see in the traditional “celebrity spread.” Brad Pitt never left the Tree of Life set. pic.twitter.com/0idnQTfBWG Overall, Pitt’s interview with Paterniti feels genuine, self-aware and open. He discusses the experience of having his family “ripped apart,” his dependence on alcohol and his shortcomings as a father. Although he rejected the term midlife crisis, Pitt is clearly going through a major life transition, one suffused with both pain and possibility. McGinley’s photos similarly reflect the complexity of this moment. From a certain angle, the artist captures Pitt as aged, gaunt and weary, his tumbling body appearing like a folkloric hermit who, after wandering too long, has finally collapsed. From another angle, however, Pitt appears almost adolescent ― his frame lanky and awkward, his tattooed body hunting for meaning or any roadsigns he can find. The images present Pitt as changing and imperfect, aging yet with much to learn.  When it comes to celebrity photo spreads, most are sexy, glamorous and aggressively unreal ― aiming to cultivate envy and desire. Starlets dressed in fantastical gowns lounge impossibly in barnyards, bathtubs and grungy dive bars; makeup artists, hair dressers, designers, photographers and editors all conspire to turn humans into icons, stripping them of their interiority and complexity. Such spreads also tend to feature young women photographed by men. Of course, publications like GQ tend to focus on male stars, but depict everyone from Leonardo DiCaprio to Adam Driver with the male equivalent qualities of charm, ruggedness and looking cool in a blazer. McGinley and Pitt flip that script a bit. McGinley is queer, though he has said in interviews he’s not sure how much his sexual orientation translates into his work. While speaking with queer artist Catherine Opie, McGinley said that his older brother, who died of AIDS when the artist was 17, played a larger role, instilling within McGinley a contagious zeal for life that he believes makes his photographs hum. “I think that, in a way, my work is a response to that,” he said, “like about really embracing life and going wild and creating photographs in which there’s so much energy and so much life being lived. For me it’s an escape. Like when I’m looking through the viewfinder, I’m in another place.”  Many of McGinley’s shoots take place during road trips, for which a bunch of friends will hit the pavement along with a trampoline, smoke machine, disco ball and other visually galvanizing tools, which can turn a gorgeous sunset into a hallucinatory epiphany. He took Pitt on a similar journey, traveling to three National Parks over eight days in March.  As Pitt put it: “If we’re going to do a celebrity shoot, let’s make something, work with an artist, see what we come up with. It’s always more interesting.”  People are, in part, so obsessed with this shoot because we so rarely see celebrities ― especially middle-age male heartthrobs ― presented in this light: awkward, struggling, sad, a little goofy, trying something new and at times failing. In one photo Pitt is literally tearing up! The images aren’t shellacked with Hollywood plastic, nor do they pulse with heartthrob machismo. They are of a different breed than the fashion magazine spreads that depict female celebrities as goddesses ― eternally unattainable and equally uncomplicated. Rather, they couple McGinley’s artistic style with Pitt’s life experience, telling a specific story whose ending remains unresolved. Instead of following the typical formula for celebrity spreads, in which the male gaze glorifies women for being young and hot, McGinley offers an awkward and multifaceted representation of a flawed and fragile male actor, imploring viewers to feel his story through his body as well as through his words.  We often hear that feminism benefits men as well as women. McGinley’s spread, despite being a great viral internet distraction for the afternoon, visualizes this claim. When photography is freed from the grip of the male gaze, powerful men are free to express their creativity and their emotions and their insecurity and fear. They are free to frolic in onesies in damp caves and look moodily into the camera. They are free to breakdance amongst rolling waves of white sand ― and to be honest, that looks really fun.  See all of the (truly amazing) photos over at GQ. "
ARTS & CULTURE,Jane Goodall Kindly Asks Ivanka Trump To Actually Take Her Advice,"In Ivanka Trump’s new book Women Who Work, the current First Daughter quotes a melange of inspirational platitudes meant to motivate her readers into “architecting” their own success. She, of course, didn’t write those statements. She borrowed them from more established self-help gurus and acclaimed authors like Sheryl Sandberg, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Friedrich Nietzsche, Anne-Marie Slaughter, David Brooks, Oprah, Socrates, Stephen Covey, Simon Sinek and ― skipping countless other entrepreneurs, activists and all around inspiring people to get to the pertinent part ― Jane Goodall. “What you do makes a difference,” Goodall’s quote reads, “and you have to decide what kind of difference you want to make.” How does Goodall feel about being lumped into to a coterie of Trump-approved sages? We’d say... skeptical. The renowned primatologist and UN Messenger of Peace told CNN that she was not aware that Trump would be quoting her, but that she “sincerely” hopes Trump “will take the full import of my words to heart. She is in a position to do much good or terrible harm.” Goodall then took the opportunity to call out the Trump administration’s hostile stance toward protected wildlife and lands: Legislation that was passed by previous governments to protect wildlife such as the Endangered Species Act, create national monuments and other clean air and water legislation have all been jeopardized by this administration. I hope that Ms. Trump will stand with us to value and cherish our natural world and protect this planet for future generations. In the past, Goodall has been even more blunt. “In many ways the performances of Donald Trump remind me of male chimpanzees and their dominance rituals,” she told The Atlantic. “In order to impress rivals, males seeking to rise in the dominance hierarchy perform spectacular displays: stamping, slapping the ground, dragging branches, throwing rocks.” “The more vigorous and imaginative the display, the faster the individual is likely to rise in the hierarchy,” she added, “and the longer he is likely to maintain that position.” Trump’s critics have been quick to jump on her perceived hypocrisy ― whether it’s related to libraries, art, Syria or equal pay.

ARTS & CULTURE,Women Dressed Up As Handmaids To Defend Reproductive Rights In Missouri,"Today in Missouri, a group of women protested in and around the state capitol dressed in a familiar costume ― the red robes and white bonnets of Margaret Atwood’s novel The Handmaid’s Tale. According to Think Progress, the women carried signs that read, “Don’t let Missouri become Gilead” and “Gilead took credit cards, #Moleg is taking Medicaid cards,” aiming to raise awareness of lawmakers’ recent push to restrict reproductive rights. The handmaids were forced to remove their bonnets before being allowed to watch the Missouri House. #MoLeg #PraiseBe #HandmaidsTale pic.twitter.com/mDgWOkm7Qb The protest, organized in part by Planned Parenthood and NARAL, expressed concern over a budget amendment that would prevent the Missouri Women’s State Funded Health Services Program from providing funding to clinics that perform abortions.  A politician who sponsored the amendment, Rep. Robert Ross (R), claimed during a debate that it would prevent taxpayer money from supporting abortion. According to the communications coordinator for Planned Parenthood Missouri, Sarah Felts, the amendment is more dangerous than that. “It defines abortion services really broadly. Not only providing abortion care, but just talking about it,” Felts told Think Progress. “There’s no clear definition of referring. It could just be talking about abortion as an option.” This is just the latest women’s health-related development in Missouri, which has seen an array of proposed pro-life bills this year.  #HandmaidsTale in the House, wondering why hats are allowed on the floor today but not theirs #moleg #PraiseBe pic.twitter.com/7PhAMzTnaL The Missouri protest followed a similar demonstration in Texas, for which participants also dressed like residents of Gilead. The Missouri protest, however, went slightly less smoothly; earlier this afternoon, Planned Parenthood Advocates in Missouri, a group that helped coordinate the protest, tweeted, “The handmaids were forced to remove their bonnets before being allowed to watch the Missouri House.” The Handmaid’s Tale, a 1985 novel by Margaret Atwood that’s recently been adapted into a Hulu series starring Elisabeth Moss, is about an American government that quickly becomes oppressive, taking away women’s credit cards and forcing them to work as “handmaids,” or enslaved sex workers for infertile couples.  The series showrunner Bruce Miller, and Atwood herself, have commented on the similarities between Gilead and the political climate in America today.

ARTS & CULTURE,About That Naked Dude Who Crashed The Met Gala...,"The best Met Gala ensembles every year fuse fashion with art to create looks that would borderline extra in any other situation. There are legendary looks, like Rihanna’s Comme des Garçons moment this year, and without fail, there are boring looks—Gisele basically wore a shiny prom dress. (Although, it was Stella McCartney so, there’s that.)   But the one 2017 Met Gala look that nobody should forget is the naked white dude in a box. In the fifth installation of his Foundling series, Russian performance artist Fyodor Pavlov-Andreevich had himself dropped in a transparent box on the steps of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, completely nude. From the video posted to the artist’s Vimeo account, it looks like he made it about three seconds before security covered the box and dragged him out. Still, onlookers stared in seeming confusion, horror, and ultimately amusement as laughing security guards pulled the box out of view. According to the Pavlov-Andreevich’s Facebook page, Foundling targets high-profile art events to “see how the institution reacts to the passive harmless box with an artist inside.” Arrested for public lewdness, obstructing governmental administration, criminal trespass, and disorderly conduct, clearly the answer is: not well! But hey, if Anna Wintour is going to let Jaden Smith accessorize with his own clipped dreads, I feel like a cute Russian guy curled up in a box is the least of our worries."
ARTS & CULTURE,"This Is Rei Kawakubo, The Designer Breaking Down Binaries At The Met","Categories can be presented as choices, but more often, they designate limitations to our freedom. Between options lurks an “or,” a subtle warning of our “this or that” restrictions. “Rei Kawakubo/Comme des Garçons: Art of the In-Between,” the exhibition opening this week at The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, operates differently. The show, honoring iconic Japanese designer Rei Kawakubo, is divided into several categorical pairings, such as “Then/Now,” “East/West,” “High/Low,” and even “Clothes/Not Clothes.” Yet the slash stuck between each pairing isn’t intended as an “or.” Instead, it’s meant to demarcate an in-between, a space that turns dichotomies into cacophonous harmonies.  The exhibition, decisively described as not a retrospective, features 150 garments from Kawakubo’s collections, divided into binary categories she then proceeds to break down. All of the pieces are presented at eye-level, so the viewer can properly observe the magic of their construction. There is no wall text whatsoever, a nod to Kawakubo’s consistent refusal to define her work in rigid terms. “The meaning is that there is no meaning,” she said in 1995. The designer was born in Tokyo in 1942, the oldest of three children and the only girl. At university, Kawakubo studied the history of aesthetics, which incorporated elements of Asian and Western Art. It was in 1973 when she established her now-famous label Comme des Garçons (which means “like some boys”), opening her first store just two years later.  Kawakubo made her Western debut in Paris in 1982, disrupting the era’s wave of glamorous power suits with saggy, lopsided black frocks accentuated with holes, shredded fabric and excess layers of more black. Like many great avant-garde works of art, Kawakubo’s collection was initially met with shock and disdain; critics described it as “ragged chic,” “Hiroshima’s revenge” and “post atomic.” One of her most iconic collections came over 10 years later with the spring/summer 1997 collection “Body Meets Dress, Dress Meets Body,” featuring skintight stretch dresses pulled over ballooning pads. The form-hugging attire accentuated the pads’ bizarre humps and swelling, radically transfiguring the wearer’s silhouette. The dresses, which were later adapted into costumes for a Merce Cunningham dance, epitomize Kawakubo’s radical ability to defy the assumptions about clothes you never knew you had.  Even if you’re not into identifying fashion designers, recognizing Kawakubo’s work is a cinch. Mostly because her designs barely resemble clothing at all, boldly defying the laws clothes are intended to serve. Most garments cater to the body of their wearer ― flattering the figure by enhancing certain body parts and downplaying others, all in accordance with ideal beauty standards. Even more fundamentally, they follow certain elementary guidelines ― for example, shirts and pants have a set amount of holes. For Kawakubo, these items of clothing are hardly that simple. As she told The Guardian: “I built my work from within instead of satisfying a demand for sexualised and ostentatious clothing.” At times, a Commes des Garçons piece can resemble a cocoon or a gift in haphazard wrapping paper. Some tops contain far too may holes for human arms to occupy, as if designed with another species in mind; others have none at all. Many feature bulging protuberances, while other extreme finishing touches like ruffles or collars seem to be exacting revenge on the wearer. Kawakubo’s designs tend to transform those who don them into mythical personae, otherworldly creatures or conceptual artworks. Instead of aspiring to make a woman look long and lean, Kawakubo endows her models with pillowy hunchbacks and architectural nests for hair, destabilizing the gaze that often governs fashion. For centuries, the act of dressing up has proven capable of turning women into characters ― the bride, the professional, the vixen, the princess, the tomboy. The ability to embody an alter ego just by slipping on a dress can be liberating, though of course, the range of available characters can also be limiting. They can seem like choices that, in reality, are anything but. Kawakubo, however, explodes the vault, queering established feminine tropes and ushering in the masculine, the inanimate, the surreal. Instead of being an “old Hollywood starlet” for a night, how about a pillowcase? A cluster of barnacles? A cobweb? Kawakubo’s clothing invites women to transcend and transmute their bodies, weaving fairytales from their own flesh. In Commes des Garçons’ world, there are no stereotypes, no laws, no masters and no categories: the freedom is absolute and often breathtaking. You might not realize how similarly individuals dress until you set eyes on a woman wearing what looks like a blowfish carcass, something so unmistakably distinct. Even at The Met Gala, where Kawakubo was the theme, Rihanna’s army of petals ― one of the few actual Comme des Garçons dresses worn ― made jaws drop. Today, Kawakubo is known as one of the most respected designers of all time ― only the second living designer to be honored with a Met exhibition, after Yves Saint Laurent’s in 1983. Some repeated themes in Kawakubo’s work include the colors black and red, bulging shapes, punk plaid, allusions to bridal and princess gowns ― somehow mangled and resuscitated ― tattered holes, shredded layers, asymmetrical hems and a sculptural intensity that’s rarely seen on the human body. Most of all though, she’s defined by her inability to be defined. Her work’s most identifiable quality is its sense of boundlessness, which brings into being visions so viscerally peculiar most of us couldn’t conjure them in a dream state. In an interview with The New Yorker, the famously silent Kawakubo revealed that she had “never belonged to a movement, followed a religion, subscribed to an ideology, or worshipped a hero.” She has even denounced those who have hailed her a feminist icon, refusing to belong to any such category. “I am not a feminist,” she said in 2009. “I was never interested in any movement as such. I just decided to make a company built around creation, and with creation as my sword, I could fight the battles I wanted to fight.” Comme des Garçons does, however, liberate women from the monolithic male gaze, from the fashionable tradition of dressing up as a mode of self-improvement. But the label does more. It frees art from existing, cold and untouched, in glass cases and frames. It releases pants from the expectation of being two-legged. And it emancipates human beings from their flesh, inviting people to embody intangible ideas that defy categorization. “Rei Kawakubo/Comme des Garçons: Art of the In-Between,” runs until September 4 at The Metropolitan Museum of Art.

ARTS & CULTURE,Anonymous Texas School Art Delivers A Message To Donald Trump,"HOUSTON, TEXAS, April 2017 - A few days after the opening of TRUMP! The Art Show, co-curated by artist and civil right attorney Randall Kallinen and John Paul Hartman, something strange happened. They received a large number of art works from anonymous Texas elementary school children - paintings, cartoons, sketches, and even flyers. With over 70 works received to date, they decided to include a number of them in the show, making them part of the highlight of the show’s closing, which will take place on Saturday, May 13 from 7 to 10 pm at 511 Broadway Street in Houston. (If you haven’t seen the show, mark your calendar! The public is invited at no charge). I went back to the Kallinen Contemporary to check out what the fuss was all about. Here’s a sampling of what I found which shows their concern, fear and hope: The works reminds me of a time long ago, when Ruby Bridges sat with Robert Coles to explain her thoughts.  I recall that she too drew her world on a fragile piece of paper. What kind of nation are we to scare our children like this?  We are failing the next generation.  The terrorist, as another wise man said, is in the White House.  "
ARTS & CULTURE,Amy Krouse Rosenthal's Daughter Continues Her Late Mother's Last Project,"Amy Krouse Rosenthal was a beloved author, wife and mother of three, who died on March 31 of this year from ovarian cancer. About a month before her death, she published a heartbreaking essay for the Modern Love series in The New York Times titled “/www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/style/modern-love-you-may-want-to-marry-my-husband.html?smid=tw-nytimes&smtyp=cur&smvar=wkndbau""}}"" data-beacon-parsed=""true"">You May Want to Marry My Husband,” expressing hope that her partner would begin a new love story after she passed away.

Rosenthal had started another project before she died called “Project 1,2,3,” for which she would post a list of new ideas, observations, or random ideas ― that could be expressed in a group of three ― every day at 1:23 p.m. The goal was to continue the endeavor for 123 days, yet she was forced to stop at Day 61.   A new 1,2,3 project posted daily at 1:23pm = #project123.

(Btw posting from east coast, hence time change for those following closely) A post shared by Amy Krouse Rosenthal (@missamykr) on Dec 30, 2016 at 10:24am PST Rosenthal bid an early farewell to the project, recognizing there were other things and people she’d prefer to focus on given her limited time.  “I have loved this project so much,” Rosenthal wrote in her final list, shared on Feb. 1. “For nearly two months now, I’ve woken up each morning excited about what I would/could create ... But in the last few days, this cancer — oh, did I mention I have cancer? ― has increasingly (and rudely) robbed me of my normal energy and focus.” Following Amy’s death, however, her daughter Paris Rosenthal took to Instagram and announced her plan to pick up where Amy left off, finishing the remaining 62 days of “Project 1,2,3” as a tribute to her mom.  A note from Amy’s daughter, Paris: Many of you know that my Mom had an Instagram project where she posted a new 1,2,3 list daily at 1:23pm. Her goal was 123 days. She made it to day 61. For the next 62 days, to complete the 123 days, I will take my own variation on this project of hers. Everyday at 1:23pm, I will post a photo that represents something about Amy Krouse Rosenthal.

As Rosenthal’s health declined, Paris took on more responsibilities, formulating the writing, photos and ideas.  Now “Project 1,2,3” offers Paris a way to connect with her mother’s ideas while honoring her legacy of creativity and love. On Day 63, Paris shared a photo of her mother’s black clog alongside her childhood black clog, both accentuated with a matching silver buckle. On Day 92, she shared a photo of her mom saying “I love you” in sign language. On Day 104, she shared a screenshot of an old text from Amy, featuring her signature good morning greeting: “Welcome to the day.” “My project is about sharing our relationship with the world,” Paris wrote. “It’s about letting everyone know how I feel about her. It’s about representing all that encompasses the Rosenthal family. And it’s about tangibly acknowledging my mom in some way everyday. It’s the only way I know how to get through this.”  For as long as I can remember, my mom would come into my room in the morning and sit on my bed, probably gaze at me for a few minutes while I was asleep, and then slowly wake me up with her sweet voice by saying, “welcome to the day.” When I left for college, she could no longer do it in person, but she would still text me every single morning.

ARTS & CULTURE,Michael Moore Is Taking His Criticism Of Trump To Broadway,"Last year, Michael Moore surprised fans when he announced he’d been making a “secret film” about then-presidential candidate Donald Trump, which he released shortly before the November election. “Michael Moore in TrumpLand,” however, has been described more as a “love letter” to Democratic hopeful Hillary Clinton than an excoriating profile of her GOP opponent. Maybe Moore’s upcoming Broadway show will give Trump critics the incendiary takedown they’ve been waiting for. Moore will indeed make his Broadway debut this summer, in a limited-run production titled “The Terms of My Surrender.” And he’s teasing the show as sufficiently Trump-critical: “Can a Broadway show take down a sitting President?” a poster reads. A slightly longer description of the “theatrical work” provides a little more color: In a time like no other in American history, and with a sense of urgency like never-before, Michael Moore comes to Broadway for the first time in an exhilarating, subversive one-man show guaranteed to take audiences on a ride through the United States of Insanity, explaining once and for all how the f*** we got here, and where best to dine before crossing with the Von Trapp family over the Canadian border. Moore will act out the “The Terms of My Surrender” ― a flexibly scripted one-man show, with the potential for guests, that’s not quite stand-up comedy or a play ― eight times a week for 12 weeks, beginning with previews in July. The performances will take place, as a press release makes clear, “blocks from Trump Tower” at the Belasco Theatre.  “It’s a humorous play about a country that’s just elected a madman,” Moore, who predicted Trump’s win, told The New York Times. “I mean, there’s really no other way to put it.”  Like “TrumpLand,” Moore has indicated that “My Surrender” will be about more than just our current president. (Though he stands by the question on the poster, quipping to the NYT: “Can something like this unravel an unhinged man? I think that discombobulation might be our most effective path to undoing his presidency.”)  “I think what the world needs right now is Michael Moore standing on a Broadway stage, sharing his hilarious stories and incendiary political perspective” the show’s director, Tony Award-winner Michael Mayer, noted in the show’s release, “creating the kind of dialogue that can only happen in the theater.” Since Trump’s election, Moore has outlined his own blueprints for resisting a man he refers to as our “so-called” president, who’s already, according to the documentarian, declared “war against the actual planet.” If you’re itching to see how Moore will continue the resistance on Broadway, you can checkout tickets for the show ― which officially opens on Aug.10 ― here."
ARTS & CULTURE,George R.R. Martin Wrote This Adorably Geeky Fan Letter When He Was 15,"George R.R. Martin was just 26 when he won the Hugo Award for Best Novella, an impressive feat for such a young writer. But he was published in print over a decade before that ― in the fan mail section of “Fantastic Four #17.” In an upcoming History channel documentary about comics, Martin says that this letter was the first time his writing appeared in print.  In a post about the letter, Entertainment Weekly notes that the “A Song of Ice and Fire” author shows an early penchant for unexpected plot twists, a staple of his own writing.  “In what other comic mag could you see things like a hero falling down a manhole,” Martin wrote. He continued to shower the issue with effusive praise:  “You were just about the World’s worst mag when you started, but you set yourself to an ideal, and, by gumbo, you achieved it! More than achieved it, in fact ― why, if you were only half as good as you are now, you’d still be the world’s best mag!!!” Read the entire letter below:"
ARTS & CULTURE,"'Priestdaddy' Takes On Priesthood, Fatherhood And The Patriarchy","No reader of Patricia Lockwood’s irreverent verse would be surprised to discover that her upbringing was a perfect storm of oddities.  Her father, a naval veteran who spends most of his time clad solely in boxer shorts, calls his daughter “Bit” and drinks Irish cream liqueur. He’s also a Roman Catholic priest ― an achievement that, given the Church’s rather strict rules regarding celibacy in the priesthood, required a circuitous path through the Lutheran priesthood and a dispensation from the pope. Her mother, a colorful Irish Catholic matriarch with five children, frequently spouts bon mots grounded in paranoia. For example: “Did you know rats in big cities are getting aggressive from eating too many cigarette butts?” Lockwood spent her childhood moving from rectory to rectory ― the Catholic Church prefers frequent geographical shakeups over allowing priests to cultivate deep roots in specific communities ― and, increasingly, imagining ways out. When her father bluntly informs her that there’s no money for her to attend the colleges she got into, she finds another way to escape: Falling in love with Jason, a boy she met online who shares her passion for poetry. She runs away with him. They get married young. Several years later, after he needs eye surgeries that force him to leave his job as a newspaper editor, he and Lockwood move in with her parents.  This is where the real action of the memoir begins. As a grown-up, married, extremely lapsed Catholic, living in the home of a traditional (in terms of gender roles) yet unconventional (in terms of clothing choices) Catholic priest and his deeply maternal wife, Lockwood experiences a maelstrom of conflicting feelings. She adores her parents and seems to have a particular closeness to her mother, but frequently finds them ludicrous. Home is familiar, but also alien; comforting, but also claustrophobic. Living in a rectory with Lockwood’s parents, a young seminarian, and copious crucifix-based art stifles them. After they move in, she and Jason “look at each other and realize, with sad certainty, that we will never have sex in this place.”  Instead, as they save up to move out again, Lockwood sits and reads with the young seminarian, periodically offering him educational tidbits about cuckolding and other sexual fetishes. In return, he lets her know that Satanism is “on the rise” in Italy. (“Understand,” she adds, “that hardcore Catholics get their news from different places than the rest of us.”) Her poem “Rape Joke” is published on The Awl and rapidly goes viral. She gets a book deal. She remembers her dad teaching her to swim and how her parents reacted when she first told them about her sexual assault. She goes on a road trip with her mom, who is slightly fastidious about a hotel bed that appears to have semen on it. “I guess a ‘fun mother’ wouldn’t care about all the cum?” she quips.  Her parents’ habits and catchphrases, her oddly religious yet profane upbringing, and her own mischievous attitude toward her childhood religion are the stuff of pure comedy, and Lockwood doesn’t waste a drop of it. Her parents’ and siblings’ over-the-top, slapstick wit seems so unlikely that she goes out of her way to note that she and Jason are constantly scribbling down her family’s riffs verbatim. Her family life needs no punching up. As a memoirist, she can milk all the humor out of human absurdity in one passage (“[M]y mother,” she writes, “is best described in terms of her Danger Face, which is organized around the information that somewhere in America, a house is on fire”). As a poet, she excels at painting familiar and unfamiliar scenes alike in startlingly unexpected terms, terms that force you to reevaluate your own mental pictures. Savannah, where she and Jason lived for some time, “looked like an enlightened underwater city with all the water gone, and seaweed still hanging in the middle of the air. Great mermaids flowed through the streets: southerners. The sun shone down because it was a blonde.” The book, with its slightly off-color-seeming title, isn’t a lighthearted ode to her youth. She struggles with her father’s ingrained, prescriptive misogyny, which he evinces with the confidence of a man who assumes that his audience agrees, and with his fierce determination to have things all his own way.  And, as the daughter of a Catholic priest, she’s looking back on a childhood and young adulthood that took place in the eye of a brewing storm: the Church’s sexual assault problem and its long, long coverup. The book isn’t about sexual abuse by priests, and there’s no indication that Lockwood herself was ever a victim ― it’s just that the problem was so pervasive, and the coverup implicated so many in the Church hierarchy, that of course she was touched by it. An oily, ingratiating priest who taught at her school later turned out to have been a molester; the bishop she meets at a church dinner reportedly moved predatory priests from parish to parish to hide their crimes. Being deeply embedded in the Catholic community means knowing men of God who did unspeakable things. It’s a testament to Lockwood’s way with words that glimpses of such grotesque wrongdoing, painfully candid reflection on her youth and her family, and countless sidesplitting anecdotes about her boxer-clad father and her safety-obsessed mother can not only coexist in this book, but weave together seamlessly, constructing a memoir that’s propulsively readable and brimming with humor and insight. The Bottom Line: Lockwood’s venture into memoir proves just as hilarious, textured and evocative as could have been hoped. What other reviewers think: Kirkus: “Funny, tender, and profane, Lockwood’s complex story moves with lyrical ease between comedy and tragedy as it explores issues of identity, religion, belonging, and love.” The Atlantic: “Lockwood’s book is really a rather deliciously old-school, big-R Romantic endeavor: a chronicle of the growth of a mind, the evolution of an imagination.” Who wrote it? Patricia Lockwood is a poet and the author of two collections, Balloon Pop Outlaw Black and Motherland Fatherland Homelandsexuals. One of her poems, “Rape Joke,” went viral in 2013 after being published on The Awl. Who will read it? Poetry buffs, former Catholic school kids and anyone who loves a well-executed memoir. Opening lines: “‘Before they allowed your father to be a priest,’ my mother tells me, ‘they made me take the Psychopath Test. You know, a priest can’t have a psychopath wife, it would bring disgrace.’ “She sets a brimming teacup in front of me and yells, ‘HOT!’ She sets a second one in front of my husband, Jason, and yells, ‘Don’t touch it!’ She situates herself in he chair at the head of the table and gazes at the two of us with total maternal happiness, ready to tell the story of the time someone dared to question her mental health.” Notable passage: “I submit that every man of God has two religions: one that belongs to heaven and one that belongs to the world. My father’s second religion is Nudity, or Underwear, to be more precise. There are some men who must strip straight down to the personality as soon as they would through the door of their castle, and my father is one of them. I have almost no memories of him wearing pants, and I have a lot of memories of his sitting me down for serious talks while leaning forward on his bare haunches. He just never wore pants on principle. We saw him in his collar and we saw him in his underwear, and nothing ever in between. It was like he couldn’t think unless his terrier could see his belly button. In the afternoons, he reclined nudely on leather couches and talked to Arnold Schwarzenegger while he shot up the jungle, and every time Arnold made a pun about murder, he laughed with gratification. As far as I could tell, he thought movies were real. He watched them in a state of alarming physical receptiveness, with his legs so completely open toward the television that it seemed possible he was trying to watch it with his butt. His default position was a kind of explicit lounge, with one leg up and the other leg extended, like the worst kind of Jazzercise stretch you could possibly imagine.”  Priestdaddy By Patricia LockwoodRiverhead, $27.00Publishes May 2, 2017  The Bottom Line is a weekly review combining plot description and analysis with fun tidbits about the book."
ARTS & CULTURE,Echoes Of World War II -- And A Loud Explosion Or Two -- On A Southern Road Trip,"There's a moment in an historical re-enactment when you start to question reality. For me, it came as I stood on the deck of the USS Alabama on a recent Sunday afternoon, watching two vintage Russian Yak aircraft barreling toward us low and menacing over Mobile Bay. On the deck of the meticulously restored battleship that served during World War II, pandemonium reigned. Sailors dressed in authentic era uniforms scrambled to load their weapons with blanks, tend to the pretend wounded and extinguish simulated fires. They're part of the USS Alabama Living History Crew, who take this kind of thing pretty seriously. How seriously? Well, for just a second, I believed the warplanes were going to take the re-enactors and their audience out in a burst of simulated cannon fire. I saw my 12-year-old son flinch. Then the warbirds pulled up and and soared south toward the ocean. The onlookers let out a collective gasp of relief. There's no better place to learn about WWII history than a road trip to Alabama and Louisiana. It's not just Battleship Memorial Park in Mobile, Ala., that will let you experience the war in a visceral way, the way the American South demands to be experienced. A short two-hour drive away in New Orleans, you'll also find the finest museum of WWII history, The National World War II Memorial Museum. You wouldn't expect to find two such opportunities so close together outside perhaps a major world capital, yet here they are. By itself, Battleship Memorial Park is worth the visit even without its history buffs and re-enactors. (They do their thing every other month, so you have to plan it right.) The USS Alabama, or the Mighty A as they call it here, looks as good as she did the day she was commissioned and is filled with ""wow"" moments -- and plenty of opportunities to lose your kids. I misplaced mine a time or two. While the little ones will be fascinated by the weapons, of which there are plenty, there's also enough to keep the adults occupied. Thoughtful exhibits and displays mark the walking tour of the USS Alabama. You could spend an entire day exploring the ship. The Mighty A has earned its place in history as the vessel that led the American fleet into Tokyo Bay on Sept. 5, 1945. Most tourists come to this area to experience Alabama's famous Gulf Coast, but the battleship is a worthy day trip and a sobering reminder of the sacrifices America and its allies made during World War II -- explosions and all. For a more immersive experience, though, you have to drive west and visit the World War II museum. Why would perhaps the world's finest World War II museum be in New Orleans, of all places? It all started as the D-Day Museum, which wouldn't have been possible without the amphibious landing vehicles built here and tested on Lake Pontchartrain by Higgins Industries. President Eisenhower credited Higgins and his boats for our winning the war in Europe. From there, the project expanded and was supported by Stephen Ambrose, a New Orleans resident and historian. Ambrose, then a professor at University of New Orleans, and Gordon ""Nick"" Mueller, the current museum CEO, were looking for a place to house the stories of veterans Ambrose was collecting and the memorabilia the veterans were giving to him. So it didn't surprise us when Tom Hanks -- the executive producer of the adaptation of Ambrose's book, Band of Brothers -- showed up to narrate the spectacular Beyond All Boundaries, a ""4-D"" multimedia explanation of the war. This is easily one of the most compelling presentations about war I've ever seen. If you're traveling with kids, you'll want to take them here first. The fog effects, pyrotechnics and moving seats really convey the drama of the conflict and set the stage for the exhibits that follow. My middle son, Iden, saw the medical warning that preceded the show, about the possibility of it aggravating ""certain medical conditions"" and asked me if we were going on a rollercoaster. But after sitting through Beyond All Boundaries he sat in stunned silence as the credits displayed. This was a rollercoaster of the mind. It's absolutely worth checking out the signature Campaigns of Courage after you watch the presentation. The Road to Berlin follows the conflict in Germany from the Normandy invasion to Germany's surrender. A second exhibit, The Road to Tokyo, charts the same course for Japan. The exhibits are highly interactive and deeply compelling. Visitors use special ""dog tags"" (they're actually plastic cards) to activate displays, which tell a personal story of someone who lived through the war. For us, one of the most sobering exhibits was on the power of propaganda, Winning Over Hearts and Minds, a short display of wartime propaganda posters. It prompted a frank discussion with my children about the subtle effectiveness of propaganda and some of its modern-day uses. You can't walk though these displays without seeing echoes of the current rhetoric used by politicians both in America and abroad. On a southern road trip, the last thing you would expect is a reminder of the greatest human conflict. But, thanks to a restored ship, a museum built in one of the unlikeliest places, and several loud explosions, you can find one that will stay with you for a lifetime. If you go … Where to stay
The International House is a boutique property located a few blocks away from the WWII museum, but also close to New Orleans' famous French Quarter. The hotel, located in a former world trade center, has been carefully restored with lots of attention to detail. What to do
Check out the Hurricane Katrina exhibit at The Presbytère, the Louisiana State Museum. It's a moving exhibit that follows this devastating hurricane and its aftermath and a testament to the city's resilience. What to eat
You mean, what not to eat? With only two days in town, we never got past breakfast. That's Cafe Du Monde for beignets and coffee and Brennan's for one of their famous breakfasts. Try the turtle soup -- but don't forget the Sherry. I'll discuss the differences between Creole and Cajun in a future story.

ARTS & CULTURE,"70 Years On, Primo Levi's 'If This Is A Man' Is Still A Powerful Reminder Of What It Means To Be Human","Nicholas Heron, The University of Queensland   When he was captured by the Fascist militia in December of 1943, Primo Levi (1919-1987) preferred to declare his status as an “Italian citizen of the Jewish race” than admit to the political activities of which he was suspected, which he supposed would have resulted in torture and certain death.    As a Jew, he was consequently sent to a detention camp at Fossoli, which assembled all the various categories of persons no longer welcome in the recently established Fascist Republic. Two months later, following the inspection of a small squad of German SS men, he was loaded onto a train, together with all the other Jewish members of the camp, for expatriation from the Republic altogether.   His destination, he was to learn, was Auschwitz; a name that at the time held no significance for him, but that initially provided a sense of relief, since it at least implied “some place on this earth”.      Of the 650 who departed Fossoli that day, only three would return. Yet Levi’s magnificent testimony of the Lager, Se questo è un uomo (If This is a Man) – which he would compose in the immediate aftermath of the resumption of his life in Turin, and which was first published 70 years ago in 1947, making it one of the earliest eyewitness accounts we have – is far from a heroic description of his “survival in Auschwitz” (as the American title given to his text would have it). Although in an important sense it is also that.   Indeed, what is striking about Levi’s contribution, still today, is the conspicuous absence of a heroic register from its pages, whose appropriateness in this context – which is in large part what Levi teaches us – must surely be as questionable as the temptation to invoke it is strong.   With characteristic, but unsettling irony, it is the word fortune that appears instead in the very first sentence of his text (“It was my good fortune to be deported to Auschwitz only in 1944…”) and that sets the tone for all that follows. In the camp, it is not virtue that governs fortune; it is fortune that governs virtue.        Levi was sent to the detention camp at Fossoli after his capture.  Jacqueline Poggi/Flickr, CC BY-SA      It is the original title of Levi’s book that in truth gives expression to what will be his principal concern. Yet this is easily misunderstood. It is not exactly a question, and certainly not one that solicits an answer. But it is not even a question whose answer would be provided by the text itself, which claims no such privilege.   As we learn from the poem that opens the text, it must be understood instead to contain an implicit imperative: “Consider if this is man…” It is an order, a command (“I command these words to you”); one that is linked, moreover, to an imprecation:    Carve them in your hearts    … Repeat them to your children,   Or may your house fall apart,   May illness impede you,   May your children turn their faces from you.    It is thus an admonition that we (“You who live safe/In your warm houses”) not avert our gaze. But since Levi, remarkably, includes even himself in this category, it functions also as a kind of self-admonition.  For the description of what Levi calls the “ambiguous life of the Lager” alters our understanding of the very structure of witnessing. And it does so by bringing to light the existence of a distinct oppositional pair much less evident in ordinary life: the drowned (i sommersi) and the saved (i salvati).   In Auschwitz, all the ritual humiliations appeared as if designed to hasten the prisoner’s descent to what Levi termed “the bottom”. But this process was especially accelerated in the case of those he called the drowned: “they followed the slope down to the bottom, like streams that run down to the sea”.   These were the prisoners who, for whatever reason (and the reasons were many), never adjusted to the brutal regimen of life in the camp; whose time in the camp was thus consequently very brief; yet whose number was apparently endless.   In the jargon of the camp, these were the Muselmänner, the “Muslims”, whose tenuous existence, even prior to their imminent selection for the gas chamber, already hovered in an indistinct zone between life and death, human and non-human. These, according to Levi, were the ones who had truly seen all the way to the bottom: the ones who (as he would later powerfully record) had truly seen the Gorgon.  With respect to the “anonymous mass” of the drowned, the number of the saved, on the other hand, was comparatively few. Yet by no means did it consist of the best, and certainly not of the elect. To invoke the guiding hand of providence in the midst of such atrocity was nothing short of abhorrent to Levi.        Primo Levi in the 1950s.  Wikimedia Commons      He is unflinching on precisely this delicate point: with rare exceptions, the saved comprised those who, in one way or another, whether through fortune or astuteness, had managed to gain some position of privilege in the structured hierarchy of the camp.   More often than not, this entailed the renunciation of at least a part of the moral universe that existed outside the camp. Not that the saved, any more than the drowned, are to be judged on this account. As Levi insists, words such as good and evil, just and unjust, quickly cease to have any meaning on this side of the barbed wire.    It was nonetheless his conviction that those who had not fathomed all the way to the bottom could not be the true witnesses. Yet far from invalidating the survivor’s testimony this made it all the more urgent.   According to Levi, it is the saved who must bear witness for the drowned, but also to the drowned. For in him is mirrored what he himself saw.   “Consider if this is a man…”: the imperative issued by Levi’s text is thus not that one should persist in seeing the human in the inhuman. It is more like its opposite: that one bear must witness to the inhuman in the human. And that our humanity in some sense depends on this.

ARTS & CULTURE,Today's Feminist Horror Owes A Lot To This Overlooked 20th-Century Artist,"Warning: This article features artworks depicting nudity and other explicit scenes. You’ve been warned.  When Carol Rama was 12 years old, her father committed suicide. Three years later, her mother was committed to a psychiatric clinic. Without any formal training, Rama turned to art as a form of therapy. She continued to make work, with limited recognition, until her death in 2015 at 97 years old.  The words “art therapy” call certain images to mind: smiling flowers and gentle trees, pointy-roofed houses and birds like lowercase m’s. You know, Bob Ross–type stuff. Rama, however, was interested in more unorthodox subject matter: tongues and teeth, prosthetic limbs and animal pelts, masturbation and puddles of shit.  The first New York museum survey of Rama’s work, titled “Carol Rama: Antibodies,” is now on view at the New Museum in Manhattan. Featuring 150 of Rama’s works, it is a stunning overview of an artist who followed no one and learned nothing, making work in her 80s the same way she did at 18, by following her gut. Despite the fact that Rama was born in 1918 and raised under Benito Mussolini’s fascist rule, her work feels current, frighteningly so. In a variety of media and styles, Rama visualizes the ecstatic horror of existing in a female body ― sexual, deranged and unbound. Today, women are creating the most visceral and compelling material in the horror genre, whose borders are bleeding out at an ever increasing pace. There is Julia Ducournau’s “Raw,” described in Rolling Stone as a “cannibal coming-of-age” movie ― a film so grotesque some theaters stocked up on barf bags for queasy viewers. There is also “XX,” an anthology of short horror films directed by and starring women, which made waves at the film festival circuit earlier this year.  Horror has crept outside the confines of film as well. Musicians including Jenny Hval, Bat for Lashes and even Beyoncé have incorporated the genre’s tropes and aesthetic into their mangled and monstrous music videos. And on TV, there’s “The Handmaid’s Tale,” a thriller that verges on horrific, based off Margaret Atwood’s haunting 1985 dystopian novel, visualized with a “radical feminist aesthetic.”  There are two interrelated ideas lurking at the core of most works of feminine horror. Firstly, the experience of being a woman can be a horrific one, plagued by restrictive standards, a persistent fear of violence, a sense of enforced silence and ― if you think about it all too much ― subsequent madness. The other key of feminist horror is, however, to subvert these terms, to take ownership of femininity and all the monstrosity it possesses. “I desire, I bleed, I make, I bite,” says the monstrous female, feeding off her own suffering and even taking pleasure from it.  Rama herself made a conscious decision to confront the unfathomable suffering she endured at such a young age, turning pain into power. “Private circumstances put me in a state of psychological amputation and loss,” she said in 1986. “I understood that I was obeying a mechanism of repetition of pain. And that when I turned it on its head, it became a sort of devotion to pain, to joy, to death.”  Rama was inspired after visiting her mother in a psychiatric clinic and observing the other patients housed there. People, she described, “with their tongues sticking out, their legs apart or crouching down in some other position.” This blatant disregard for societal norms enthralled young Rama, who found in women with mental illness something stimulating and even hopeful. “The sticking-out tongue is the object of desire,” she said in 1995. “The desire that we have too, except that etiquette enables us to swallow our tongues.” In the 1930s, Rama began creating delicate watercolors of undressed women, desirous and deranged. She often returned to the image of “Dorina,” a nude woman reclining blissfully as a snake writhes from between her legs. Her labia is blood red, as is her tongue, which dangles from her lips like a slab of raw meat.  “Sin is my master,” Rama once said, when asked about artists who influenced her. The snake, a symbol of sin in Christianity, often manifests in her work, though its presence often seems more pleasurable than agonizing. During the time Rama was creating her early work, Fascism labelled deviant bodies of any kind as wicked ― whether they be physically disabled or sexually unorthodox in any way. Rama made such persons her subjects, rendering women in wheelchairs and strapped into hospital beds, men touching themselves while admiring dead horses and a lady mid-squat, producing a watery pile of poop. Through her work she bestowed the de-humanized deviants persecuted by a Fascist regime with subjectivity, and this, humanity.  “I believe there is no freedom without derangement,” Rama said in 1997. “But then, we are all pretty deranged.” When Rama first exhibited her work in 1945 at Turin’s Faber Gallery, the show was abruptly shut down by the police for public indecency. Over 25 works were lost or destroyed as a result. This incident prompted Rama to explore more abstract avenues for exploring similar subject matter. Moving from figuration to expressionist collage, she continued to create works that growled and licked and scratched, never aligning herself with any particular movement, tradition or man.  Rama’s abstract works, it turned out, were even more ghastly than her figurative depictions, the kind of nonsensical scary most of us only encounter in a dream state. Her canvasses are first covered with oozing globs of black, red and brown, then sprinkled with objects like doll eyeballs, fingernails or dirty syringes. The paintings resemble botched autopsies, glimpses inside bodies that refuse to remain silent any longer, their bloody insides at long last coming out to play. With her 1950s and ‘60s work, which she called bricolages, Rama took the unbound body one step further, exorcising all unnecessary parts like hair and skin. This is body horror at its finest, inspiring a mix of terror and fascination in the viewer. Rama threw the unknowability of our own bodies back at us, illuminating that few real-life monstrosities can compare to the excrescence of our own blood and guts.  Rama went on to fold themes into her work that inspire feminist horror of all genres to this day. For example, one series titled “Omens of Birnam” is based on the Three Witches in “Macbeth,” who use their powers to control the fates of men. Rama was enthralled with mythical, occult women, a subject which was recently explored in 2016’s “The Witch.”  For another series, Rama worked with textiles to transfigure the traditional bridal gown, eschewing traditional white for black frocks accentuated with red gashes and welts. Blood-splattered wedding dresses, symbolizing the perversion of purity, have become a horror flick mainstay, most memorably appearing in prom dress form in “Carrie.”  In the 1990s, Rama became fixated, along with much of the world, on bovine spongiform encephalopathy, a deadly illness also known as mad cow disease. Research revealed that an epizootic in the U.K. was a result of cattle being fed a cattle meat-based product, therefore unwittingly committing cannibalism time and time again. Infected beasts would convulse wildly as their brains deteriorated, a visceral physical manifestation of their mental anguish.  In this bizarre tale of cannibalism and madness, Rama glimpsed her own story, and the story of womankind. She connected human’s hunger for cow meat with men’s hunger for women’s flesh, thereby aligning pornography with cannibalism. “The feminine body is meat and animal meat is a body that has been sexualized by the normative heterosexual gaze,” Beatriz Preciado writes in The Passion According to Carol Rama.  The madness that results from this cannibalistic chain of bodies consuming bodies, Rama believes, has been cast over time as “female hysteria.” The artist summed up her conclusions by stating, “The mad cow is me and that has given me joy, an extraordinary joy.” Her mad-cow-centric works take the shape of large-scale collages featuring pieces of rubber cut in the shapes of breasts, testicles and meaty sacs. It’s hard to decipher which parts are food and which are not.  In the film “Raw,” eating meat serves as a metaphor for self-discovery and self-empowerment, feasting off others to strengthen oneself. The taboo act of eating meat generates a chain of rule-breaking discoveries ― some sexual, others psychological, some straight-up cannibalistic. The film offers an empowering alternative to Rama’s mad cow premonition ― finally a woman gets to do the consuming, for once.  Today, it still qualifies as news when a “unlikable woman” appears on television. Yet decades ago, in the 1940s, Rama was pushing boundaries by depicting, in dainty watercolor, a woman sticking out her tongue while spreading her cheeks and taking a shit.  Throughout her life, Rama followed no “masters,” accepted no instruction and adhered to no tradition. Her oeuvre is as loose and leaky as the innards of a dead animal. She preferred to work untrained and untethered, thus making art which which she believed “belonged to everybody,” because “madness is close to everybody” ― male or female, man or beast. Sadly, she did not receive widespread acknowledgment for her work until she was in her 80s. Even now, she remains largely unknown and underappreciated, especially given the unorthodox and insurgent nature of her work.  In subject matter and style, Rama’s work most closely resembles work made decades after her ― by artists working in film, music and television. A true pioneer of the monstrous feminine, Rama realized the brutality inflicted on women’s bodies and minds and the seed of pleasure buried within that brutality. Embrace the depravity, she teaches, embrace the lunacy, embrace everything. When there is desire, even amidst unbearable suffering, there is joy.  “Carol Rama: Antibodies” runs until September 10, 2017 at New Museum. "
ARTS & CULTURE,Now You Can Learn 'Game Of Thrones' Fictional Language... For Real,"Even the most dedicated “Game of Thrones” fan probably isn’t fluent in Dothraki or High Valyrian, the two fictional languages spoken in George R. R. Martin’s epic series. But that’s about to change. The University of California at Berkeley is offering a summer class in the Dothraki’s native tongue. And it’s led by Berkeley alum, linguist David J. Peterson, who created both languages for the critically acclaimed HBO show. Titled “The Linguistics of Game of Thrones and the Art of Language Invention,” Peterson’s class will meet for four days a week during the May 22 - June 30 summer term, according to Berkeley News.  The show’s seventh season is scheduled to return on July 16. And actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who plays Jaime Lannister on the show, confirmed this week that many of the leaks about the show’s upcoming season are real.  “Every year, there are huge spoilers online where people find out real stuff and they will post it, and you go, ‘Oh my God, they just spoiled the whole season online!’ But then, because there’s 10,000 other spoilers out there, they’re not real. It just gets lost in the shuffle,” he told HuffPost. “So, it’s all out there by the way ... if you can find it.”"
ARTS & CULTURE,This Instagram Account Is Documenting Every Anti-Donald Trump Sticker In NYC,"These small stickers are being used to make a big political point. Dozens of different anti-Donald Trump labels have appeared across New York City since his presidential election win in November 2016. And the man behind the Resist Trump account on Instagram is on a mission to document each and every one of them. “They’re basically all over the place, anywhere you would normally see street art,” said the photographer, Tim Olmstead, via email this week. “Phone booths are surprisingly fertile ground, I’ve noticed.”  #resist #resisttrump #trump #trumpmemes A post shared by Resist Trump (@resistrump) on Apr 14, 2017 at 1:40pm PDT Olmstead, 32, said he was inspired to chronicle the often inconspicuous works of art after seeing the message “Fuck Trump” scrawled on New York City’s Manhattan Bridge. “Since then I have just kept an eye out for it,” he said, revealing that he photographs the stickers as he walks around Manhattan and Brooklyn. He also occasionally features other forms of protest art on his account. His favorite label is currently the above one with the word “NO” underneath an emblem depicting Trump’s coiffed hair. He prefers the pieces that make you think.  #resist #resisttrump #trump #trumpmemes A post shared by Resist Trump (@resistrump) on Apr 21, 2017 at 5:11pm PDT “I mean, the ones where people just write ‘Fuck Trump’ or ‘Trump sucks’ don’t exactly grab my attention the way, for instance, (Steve) Bannon puppeteering Trump does,” Olmstead said of the above image of the White House Chief Strategist in control of the president. The underlying theme behind all the stickers he has photographed is “probably the same thing that inspired me to start taking the pictures,” he said. “It’s a way of dealing with and trying to make at least a little light out of a dark situation.” Visit the account here, see more anti-Trump street art here and check out some of the other stickers below:  #resist #resisttrump #trump #trumpmemes A post shared by Resist Trump (@resistrump) on Apr 14, 2017 at 1:30pm PDT  #resisttrump #resist #trump #trumpmemes A post shared by Resist Trump (@resistrump) on Apr 25, 2017 at 2:06pm PDT  #resist #trump #trumpmemes #resisttrump A post shared by Resist Trump (@resistrump) on Mar 9, 2017 at 6:04am PST  #resist #trump #trumpmemes #resisttrump A post shared by Resist Trump (@resistrump) on Mar 24, 2017 at 3:12pm PDT  #trumpmemes #trump #resisttrump #resist A post shared by Resist Trump (@resistrump) on Apr 21, 2017 at 4:52pm PDT  #resist #resisttrump #trump #trumpmemes A post shared by Resist Trump (@resistrump) on Apr 15, 2017 at 8:27pm PDT"
ARTS & CULTURE,'Sheeple' Has Been Added To The Dictionary,"We all know Merriam-Webster rivals Hannah Horvath in being the voice of our generation. The dictionary is also very involved in the Twitterverse, particularly when it comes to politics, subtly throwin’ shade like it ain’t no thang. So, it makes sense for this to be the latest Merriam-Webster addition: “Sheeple.” Wake up!'Sheeple' is in the dictionary now. https://t.co/pbXVADEoBm “Sheeple,” a portmanteau of “sheep” and “people,” is defined as “people who are docile, compliant or easily influenced.” Because, you know, sheep are really chill and can be pretty much herded wherever. It’s similar in sentiment to the word “lemming.” Merriam-Webster uses the word in a sentence that hits deeply close to home: “Apple’s debuted a battery case for the juice-sucking iPhone — an ungainly lumpy case the sheeple will happily shell out $99 for.” But, despite that iPhone realness, the most-known example of the word is likely “Wake up, sheeple!” The phrase “wake up, sheeple!” has been around for years, but appears to have become a well-circulated meme after appearing in an “xkcd” web comic from 2012. The comic, according to Know Your Meme, is about “a civilization of sheep-people hybrids who are awakened from their underground slumber after a man yells, ‘Wake up, Sheeple!’” That’s obviously incredibly literal, but “sheeple” has also been used as a politically-charged word ― apparently since the 1940s. W. R. Anderson, in his column “Round About Radio,” published this line in 1945: “The simple truth is that you can get away with anything, in government. That covers almost all the evils of the time. Once in, nobody, apparently, can turn you out. The People, as ever (I spell it ‘Sheeple’), will stand anything.” More recently, in 2004, an Urban Dictionary entry gave a usage example stating that sheeple supported the war on terrorism: Hmm... By adding “sheeple” to the dictionary now, in 2017, could Merriam-Webster be making another kind of statement? "
ARTS & CULTURE,"These Muslim, Jewish And Christian Artists Use Music To Break Barriers","A group of musicians in Illinois is using its talents to bring different communities together.  The Salaam-Shalom Music Project brings together artists of Muslim, Jewish and Christian backgrounds to play music from one another’s culture and history. Songs are played in the original languages, which include Arabic, Russian, Hebrew, Yiddish, Urdu and French. By playing these types of songs, artists can connect with the emotions and history behind songs of different religions. “When you learn music, you actually deepen your own feelings and you begin to understand things that may have just seemed foreign or different before,” Lori Lippitz, the project founder, told Newsy. Jews and Muslims have had over 70 years of division in the Middle East, but Lippitz says there aren’t that many differences between the two groups. And Yasmin Ali, a Muslim vocalist with the group, thinks similarly. “Divisions are everywhere,” Ali said. “I hope that by seeing people collaborating on stage and finding commonality in a very beautiful and harmonious way, they can just take something from that and apply it in their own lives. “ Multiple religious groups have banded together in the face of an increase in discrimination and hate crimes following the 2016 election. Instead of acting helpless in the face of world issues, these artists are using their outlets to promote the message of “Salaam” and “Shalom,” which both mean peace. “It’s not enough to see the news and feel sorry about it and turn the TV off,” said Amro Hosny Helmy, vocalist and oud player. “We need to say something; We need to do something. I do what I know: I play music.” With the support of the Klezmer Music Foundation, the group performs concerts and private events in the Chicago area. The Saalam-Shalom Music Project has performed at universities as well.  “Giving our students the opportunity to witness such a culturally diverse group of artists is a priceless experience,” Matthew Charnay, DePaul’s Jewish student services coordinator, told the website.   Welcome to Battleground, where art and activism meet."
ARTS & CULTURE,"Public Art Project Is Giving Away 4,000 Free Copies Of 'Handmaid's Tale'","Written in 1985, Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale has never been out of print. So to call renewed interested in the beloved dystopian story a “resurgence” might be disingenuous ― the book’s popularity was never in question.  Nonetheless, as President Donald Trump has ascended to the highest public office and policymakers have suggested revoking basic women’s rights, the story of Gilead ― a militant and theocratic future-version of the United States reliant on a group of sexually enslaved handmaids to repopulate its dwindling republic ― evokes a different kind of urgency. Perhaps that’s why the new Hulu adaptation of the book, starring Elisabeth Moss, is stirring up enough political parallels that people are clamoring to buy, borrow or read by whatever means necessary Atwood’s original source material. (Even high school teachers are using the book to talk about America today.) Thanks to a public artwork in New York City, anyone trying to get their hands on the book can do so free of charge. A massive installation on Chelsea’s elevated park, the High Line, designed by graphic artists Paula Scher and Abbott Miller, houses 4,000 complimentary copies of The Handmaid’s Tale.  Yes, passersby can simply take a book from the massive installation, no charge whatsoever, and return home with a free novel that warns of a dictatorial future. By removing the books from the wall, participants will reveal “messages of female empowerment and anti-authoritarian resistance,” including the novel’s central battle cry: “Nolite te bastardes carborundorum,” or “Don’t let the bastards grind you down.” “The Handmaid’s Tale provides a chilling reminder of how easily the darkest currents of repression can re-surface,” the artists expressed in a statement. “The installation we designed shows how these dark messages are often accompanied by bombastic language and imagery: spectacle becomes a form of persuasion. Cracks in the floorboards reveal empowering texts, glimpses of resistance for an uncertain age.” The glorified public bookshelf, flanked by stunning images of the handmaids from the book and show, will be open through April 30, near the High Line’s 16th Street entrance. The Hulu series, for those who’ve yet to binge on its first three episodes, began streaming on April 26."
ARTS & CULTURE,'The Handmaid’s Tale' Is A Master Class On The Power Of Rebellion,"In the third episode of Hulu’s “The Handmaid’s Tale,” viewers are exposed to a quotidian site seldom shown on television: a shock of red, sitting plainly in the heroine’s underwear, delivering the news that she’s started her period, and isn’t, as she thought, pregnant. Menstruation is part of many women’s daily (or, monthly) lives, but the visual display of it remains a taboo in media. Just last year, a tampon company made waves by showing women boxing and climbing, and getting bloody as a result. Before that, depictions of bloody periods didn’t usually make it to TV, barring a few exceptions from “Degrassi,” “Mad Men,” and “Broad City.” So, the choice to include a splotch of blood in “The Handmaid’s Tale” is a bold one. But, in an interview with The Huffington Post, showrunner Bruce Miller was matter-of-fact about the decision. “Our version needed to be unflinching if it was going to be successful.” Many women menstruate and bleed, he said, “and if people are uncomfortable with that, tough.” This is in keeping with an inflammatory comment made by the cast during a panel at the Tribeca Film Festival, that they’ve since wheeled back. “It’s just a story about a woman,” actress Madeline Brewer said, when asked whether she got involved with the story because of its feminist themes. “It’s a human story because women’s rights are human rights,” the show’s star, Elisabeth Moss, said. The remarks caused a stir, and were blamed on Hulu’s marketing team, even though Atwood herself has made similar claims. The author has taken issue with certain aspects of early feminism, which took a stand against feminine modes of self-expression; she’s also said that the story is about power dynamics more broadly, and could’ve been told from a man’s point of view. In a recent New York Times op-ed, the author wrote, “[I]s ‘The Handmaid’s Tale’ a ‘feminist’ novel? If you mean a novel in which women are human beings — with all the variety of character and behavior that implies — and are also interesting and important, and what happens to them is crucial to the theme, structure and plot of the book, then yes. In that sense, many books are ‘feminist.’” In other words, Atwood makes a distinction between her intention as a storyteller and the implications of the book for readers and scholars. As a novelist, she aims to tell a story about an individual’s struggles, her daily wants and hopes and fears. The character doesn’t explicitly observe that her biological womanhood is an integral part of her oppression and her experience of the world, as a feminist essayist might; instead, she observes that she’s feeling scared, or mad, or happy. But, to create a woman character who thinks and feels on her own terms is a feminist act, and certainly to read the book is a feminist experience. Like Atwood, Miller discusses the show as Offred’s story, first and foremost. Early on, in hiring a director and costume designer, the team decided that filming close-in on Offred, to create a claustrophobic effect that would emulate her oppression, would be stylistically key. “The book has a sense of anecdotal remembrance. She’s remembering things that’ve happened to her. So you don’t want to forget that she was there ― there’s no objectivity, it’s Offred telling stories of herself, of her life. You don’t ever want to lose that feeling of the book, that it’s a very personal narrative of Offred’s,” Miller said. “One of the strongest things about the book was not knowing everything else that was happening. We’re so used to being able to hop on the internet or watch TV or ask somebody a question, and she’s lost all of that. And that, to me, was so scary and so frustrating.” To this end, the team worked to design custom bonnets that would let light through, so that scenes filmed close to Moss’s face would be possible. “You feel every emotion go across her face, even when she wants to hide from the rest of the world,” Miller said. Staying true to the heroine’s point of view was key for Miller, who said he wanted to keep as much of Atwood’s original story intact as possible. Most of the updates were tethered to technology. In the book, Serena Joy, the woman who Offred serves as a handmaid for, is an evangelical personality on TV; in the show, she’s an author.  “If it isn’t real ― if you can say, ‘Oh, that’s not the real world’ ― then it’s less scary. The more it feels like the real world, the scarier it becomes, at least to me,” Miller said.  As it relates to today’s political climate, Miller thinks the show will encourage viewers to, “appreciate the freedoms that we have, and see little ways that they’re chipped away and what that can lead to.” Although the show was conceived before last year’s presidential election, Miller thinks its themes are relevant.  “There’s been just an unrelenting assault on [...] women’s sovereignty over their own bodies, that’s been happening at the state level and the national level, that’s been head-spinning,” he said.  Again, he steered the conversation toward Offred’s personal struggle, and what readers and viewers can glean from it.  “Every single part of her life is so truncated. Yet, she still finds ways to keep her brain alive, she still finds ways to manipulate and move the world around her to increase her chances of survival,” Miller said. “I think to me that’s super inspiring, because I always feel like ― the problems that we have, the government seems like an intractable force, a big, faceless force, but if Offred could do something, I should get off my ass and do something as well.”"
ARTS & CULTURE,Stephen King Has A 'Gentle' Message For Trump Voters,"Author Stephen King has a message for people who voted for President Donald Trump and still support him. I say this gently and kindly: If you voted for Trump and still think he's doing a good job, you haven't been paying attention. The horror master is likely referencing recent polls that showed Trump voters weren’t having any second thoughts about their pick for president. A Washington Post/ABC News poll found only 2 percent had any regrets. At the same time, Trump approaches his 100-day mark as president with a record-low approval rating overall and a fairly meager list of accomplishments.   King has long been critical of Trump. In March, he mocked the president’s unproven wiretapping claims in a series of tweets. And last year, prior to the election, King shared this:  My newest horror story: Once upon a time there was a man named Donald Trump, and he ran for president. Some people wanted him to win."
ARTS & CULTURE,"In 'Captured,' People In Prison Draw The 'People Who Should Be'","Charles and David Koch are the CEO and VP of Koch Industries, respectively. Joseph Acker is an incarcerated artist currently serving a 10-year sentence. Acker doesn’t know the Koch brothers personally, but he drew them as part of a project called “Captured.” Started by Jeff Greenspan and Andrew Tider in 2016, “Captured” attempts to shine a spotlight on what its creators deem are “crimes masquerading as commerce.” By asking incarcerated artists to draw the CEOs, VPs and chairmans they believe should be behind bars, they hope to inspire other people to consider a world in which the highest levels of corporate leadership are held personally responsible for the illegal actions of their companies. “If we put poison in a glass of your drinking water, and you got sick or your children had birth defects because of it, we would certainly be hauled off to prison,” Greenspan told HuffPost. “But when a corporation does it on a large scale, if anything, they’re given a fine. [...] It’s kind of just the cost of doing business.” “So we started thinking,” he added, “it’s interesting when you have the veil of a corporation around you, it’s almost like you’re exempt from [...] behaving within the law.” Greenspan and Tider recognized early on the power of juxtaposing the circumstances of incarcerated artists with the “rap sheets,” as they call them, of corporate leaders accused of various misdeeds. In Acker’s case, he’s serving 10 years in prison for receiving stolen goods, possessing altered passports, and possessing body armor as a felon. The Koch brothers, “Captured” asserts on its website, have yet to see prison time for bribing their way into securing contracts in Africa, India and the Middle East; selling millions of dollars of petrochemical equipment to Iran; bribing judges and legislators; propagating mass deception by funding climate change denial groups; polluting American’s air, water and climate; and rigging Congress. “What we thought would be interesting is to juxtapose the two: People who are in jail, who society has already deemed to be criminals, whether it be for murder or for theft or for burglary or manslaughter. And put them up against companies who are really committing the same kinds of crimes,” Greenspan said. “So we display each piece of artwork with a ‘rap sheet’ ― a ‘rap sheet’ for the incarcerated artist and a ‘rap sheet’ for the companies and the crimes they’ve committed over the past couple of decades.” ”Captured” wasn’t easy to get off the ground. In order to get in touch with the various incarcerated artists who took part in the project, Greenspan and Tider originally reached out to the prisons and prison wardens themselves, to no avail. Eventually, they got in touch with an art therapy program coordinator who couldn’t help them on the record, but agreed to bring a letter from the two men detailing the project to the prison she worked with. “She couldn’t promise it wouldn’t be in her pocket the day she visited the prison and fall out of her pocket in the art room,” they explained. Next, Greenspan and Tider turned to eBay, where they found a group of incarcerated artists selling portraiture ― images of Elvis or Madonna or other famous people. They contacted the eBay sellers, who tended to be family or friends of the incarcerated individual, who would facilitate contact with the actual artist. “Once we got there, the project sort of went viral in the prison system,” Tider added. “An inmate would tell another inmate, even in other prisons, and we were able to get a lot of artists that way.” To arrange for the actual portraits in “Captured,” Greenspan and Tider began by offering artists a selection of five to 10 corporate leaders they could draw. But because of the limited means of communication, and the delays that come along with using traditional snail mail, they felt it became more feasible if they just chose a subject for each of their participating artists. So Greenspan and Tider would create a dossier on the proposed subject, with images to draw from, background on the associated company, and information and case materials on the “crimes” committed, and send it to the artist. If the artist agreed to draw the person, the project moved forward. If they didn’t, they could offer them a different person. “All the incarcerated artists knew the aspects of the project and the context of the project,” Greenspan added. He and Tider warned them about the attention the project could draw and the subsequent blowback that could affect an inmate’s chances at parole; some of the individuals involved were on death row and felt little regard for those potential consequences. Moreover, each artist was compensated fairly for their work. “Captured” paid the artists $100 (based on an estimation that the average rate for a prison portrait was $30), covering any fees associated with services like JPay. Online, “Captured” includes links to contact information for the incarcerated artists, allowing fans of their work to reach out if they so choose.  “Corporations maintain that they have the same rights and freedoms as individuals. That’s kind of a reframing of a corporate entity that has no conscience ― it’s now being considered a person,” Greenspan noted. “Yet we’ve got actual people in prison who are treated like subhumans. By putting contact information there, by showing their artistry ― we’ve seen people go, ‘Wow, there’s a person behind this.’” “Captured” also takes physical form. Last year, Greenspan and Tider sold 1,000 “Captured” books, donating all proceeds to the Bernie Sanders presidential campaign. The timing couldn’t have been more ideal ― they’d included a portrait of Rex Tillerson, currently the secretary of state in President Donald Trump’s administration, in the series. This year, they have plans to release 1,000 more copies, and although they don’t know yet where the proceeds will go, they’ve been thinking about groups like the Brooklyn Bail Fund or organizations working on prison reform policies and lowering prison populations. “When you see something like Rex Tillerson become secretary of state, a man who’s worked for a company with decades-long abuses of the law ― what it’s done to our environment. It’s troubling,” Greenspan said. “But we’re not telling you that it should be troubling, we’re asking you to at least consider it.” “One of the big goals was to redefine things in people’s minds,” Tider concluded. “If you consider corporations anew, and you consider the things that they’ve done, you might come out with a different perspective on them. Likewise, it’s the same for the inmates. If you thought of inmates as people who were very different from you, you might see the beautiful artistry they do and think differently.” Welcome to Battleground, where art and activism meet."
ARTS & CULTURE,This Poem About The Darkness Of Depression Gets Beautifully Animated,"I first began writing poetry when I was in high school to escape the constant and merciless torture inflicted on me by the homophobic monsters I called my classmates. My biology teacher, bless her, let me hide out in her lab during lunch or other free periods so I could avoid whatever living nightmares awaited me in the school hallways, and I began to write as a way to process the agony I was living through. 20 years later, I’m alive and thriving, and I credit poetry as playing a large part in me still being on this planet. Today, I have an MFA in poetry from New York University, and while my job as editorial director of HuffPost Voices makes it hard for me to dedicate the kind of time and energy I’d like to my poetry, I still write ― often to work through confusion or pain or other emotions in the same way I did as a 14-year-old. Last year, in the midst of a particularly bad bout of depression, I wrote a poem entitled “This Might Not Make Sense Now, But Don’t Worry, It Will.” The poem deals with the strange and devastating feeling of being so distanced from the things that made me happy that, while not being suicidal, I worried that I had become so apathetic about my life that it now held little meaning for me. After reading the poem, Carina Kolodny, a creative director at HuffPost (and a friend of mine) asked if Ji Sub Jeong, one of HuffPost’s talented multimedia producers, could have a go at animating it, and I was incredibly moved by the poem’s transformation from written word to animated short.  Today we’re sharing the piece as part of National Poetry Month. Check it out above and read the poem below.   This Might Not Make Sense Now, But Don’t Worry, It Willfor Paolo Fanoli When I ask Paolo how to draw the line between  not wanting to live anymore and wanting to die,  all he’ll quietly commit to is “that isn’t funny.”   I’m worried I worry him.   He says if I ever left him he would keep my body  under his bed and drag it out once a day to remember me,  prop up the less and less of me that’s left of me  and remind me of the world I left behind me — just look!  Some people can wake up every morning, open their  eyes and recognize something beautiful, even if it’s  just the sun slobbering across the bedroom floor with its  hot black tongue,    so, why can’t you?   He’s right, of course, but when I was 14, nothing was  more beautiful than the thought of the heavy gray  garage door guarding the far edge of my family’s driveway  and how sweetly, how surely it could kiss my head apart from the rest of my body if only I asked it sweetly  enough.   Things were different then —   I still was afraid to ask for what I wanted then and I  spent my lunch hours holed up in the biology lab hiding  from the other boys, sobbing into my sandwich, another  pickled frog prince bobbing in his embalming fluid, one more  never-born piglet day-drunk on the useless daydream of  one day living someone else’s life on the other side of the glass    but we both know how that story ends."
ARTS & CULTURE,'Handmaid's Tale' Showrunner Is Already Talking About Future Seasons,"Hulu’s soon-to-be-released adaption of Margaret Atwood’s 1985 dystopian classic, The Handmaid’s Tale, has yet to premiere, but that hasn’t stopped the showrunner and producers from dreaming about future seasons. During a panel discussion that took place after a screening of the series’ first episode at Tribeca Film Festival, members of the cast and crew discussed all things “Handmaid’s Tale,” including how the source material for the adaptation of Atwood’s incredibly prescient novel leaves the door wide open for an expanded version of the story for TV.  “When the book ends, the reaction is fury, because the way it ends is so cut off,” showrunner Bruce Miller told audiences on Friday night. “And so in some ways, immediately, the first thing you think of is ― how are we going to expand this story? Because that’s what your desire is as a reader.” The book, he noted, is written strictly from the perspective of Offred ― one of the many handmaids living in the theocratic dictatorship known as Gilead, who are forced to function as sexual surrogates for leaders of the republic. In this indeterminate future version of the United States, sterility has become an overwhelming issue, resulting in a return to “traditional” values and widespread subjugation of women, particularly those of lower social standing who are capable of bearing children for more powerful men.  “The book is so strictly from Offred’s point of view, that you hear about all of these amazing, interesting worlds and all of these parts of all of these things that are going on, but you don’t see any of them going on in the book,” Miller explained. “That, to me, as a TV series [showrunner], seemed like ... once you create this world, you have a lot of places to go.” “I wanted to know more,” he added. “I wanted to know what happens next. The end of the book is quite a mystery, so I get to make it up.” The first three episodes of the Hulu series certainly center around the life of Offred (Elisabeth Moss), once a free mother and wife who’s now forced to live with, serve and produce children for a high-ranking commander in Gilead’s militant regime. But we’re also given a glimpse into the worlds of fellow handmaid Ofglen (Alexis Bledel), Offred’s best friend from college Moira (Samira Wiley), the commander’s wife Serena Joy (Yvonne Strahovski), handmaid trainer Aunt Lydia (Ann Dowd), and even the commander himself (Joseph Fiennes). “You might not stay with Offred the whole time,” teased “Lemonade” cinematographer Reed Morano, the director of the first three “Handmaid’s” episodes. Executive producer Warren Littlefield was more than willing to entertain the idea of future “Handmaid’s Tale” seasons as well: The landscape of television right now is such an exciting playground for artists. The audience asks, each and every year, to only get more complex in character and more complex in story. Look at who’s up on stage. Each and every one of these actors ― the characters that they play ― there’s so much to explore. Where a limited series is certainly thriving right now in the television landscape, Bruce has years and the struggle continues. God knows it’s relevant. So [...] we’ve only scratched the surface in the first 10 hours and our hope is that we leave you with, “Oh, I have to have more.” “The Handmaid’s Tale” will premiere on Hulu on April 26. Meantime, here are some images from the show to get you excited:"
ARTS & CULTURE,"So You Want To Talk About Ghost In The Shell, The Whitewashed Edition?","Whitewashing is a problem that has been spotlighted repeatedly since the 20th century, and the awareness of it has increased especially in the past year with the growing prevalence of whitewashing in Hollywood. Despite opposing opinions, whitewashing is a legitimate racial issue: it is an instance of American media erasing POCs’ stories and histories, removing opportunities for much-needed POC visibility and representation. Furthermore, as whitewashing removes POC visibility and representation, it is also an instance of American media affirming the stereotype that to be American is to be white. To be clear, there are five major forms of whitewashing: first, when characters that were originally drawn or described as POCs are replaced by white characters or actors in live-action adaptations of fiction; second, similar to the first, is when POC characters are played by white actors, but the white actors pretend to be POCs (eg. blackface); third, when films based on true stories about POCs portray these stories from a white perspective, by prioritizing or privileging the white experience; fourth, is when while the majority of characters are played by actors of color, all of the major roles or most developed characters are played by white actors. (Examples for each are: The Lone Ranger, The Last Airbender, Dances with Wolves, and The Last Samurai respectively.) Finally, the fifth is arguably when most films produced by a particular industry, or of a particular genre, feature only white actors. Recent cases of Hollywood’s live-action adaptations of originally Japanese works are just more examples of whitewashing. Let’s take a look at the following remakes: Dragonball Evolution (2009), Ghost in the Shell (2017), and Death Note (2017). Dragon Ball is not set in Japan, but there is a basic understanding that unless made clear otherwise, all manga and anime characters are East Asian, and usually Japanese at that (even if they are blond). Dragon Ball specifically, although it is a Japanese creation, is a story inspired by a famous Chinese novel, Journey to the West. Journey to the West is one of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature (read: it’s a big deal), and one of its main characters is named Sun Wukong. Dragon Ball’s protagonist, Son Goku, is based on that character and his name is derived from Sun Wukong’s as well; Son Goku is the Japanese pronunciation of the Chinese name Sun Wukong. Do you know what this means? This means that Dragon Ball is inherently East Asian. No, it is not set in Japan, but its narrative is inherently Asian. Asian is not white. Goku is not white. So casting Goku with a white person, is whitewashing. Furthermore, this whitewashing of Dragon Ball is also problematic because the film remake preserves only the stereotypical Asian elements where a white protagonist has an Asian mentor while no other main characters are Asian, (as in the case of Karate Kid for instance). Films like this not only plays into the stereotyping of what Asian elements are, but also suggests that even when elements of a character are Asian, the role should be given to a white person. Similar to Dragon Ball, Ghost in the Shell is an internationally acclaimed manga and anime created by a Japanese person. Unlike Dragon Ball however, Ghost in the Shell is explicitly Japanese both in terms of its setting and its narrative. Ghost in the Shell is, as summarized by a critic, “sacrosanct among a generation of artists, writers, animators, and filmmakers who witnessed anime’s ascendency as a cultural export”. Therefore, it’s especially outraging that Major, “a character traditionally coded as a Japanese woman working at the behest of a Japanese domestic terrorism unit” is being played by Scarlett Johansson who is undeniably not Japanese (nor Asian for that matter). However, despite the whitewashing of the lead role, Paramount’s film still sets itself within a futuristic Japan with elements from other Asian locations. The original plot-line of Ghost in the Shell is also integral to the Japanese narrative. As comic book writer Jon Tsuei explains, both the manga and the first film were released at a time when Japan was considered the world leader in technology. Japan, after having gone from being positioned to conquer the Pacific to being forcibly disarmed, poured their resources into their economy and set a new standard by producing all the new technology. What does that mean? It means that Japan has a highly unique relationship with technology and since the story of Ghost in the Shell plays off of all of those themes, it is inherently a Japanese story. Furthermore, Major’s Japanese identity is actually integral to the story because Major struggles with her identity specifically within the Japanese society. These elements that make the story richer are all lost when the cast is whitewashed. To make things worse, Paramount decided to try to address this anger towards whitewashing by running special effects test to make Johansson appear “more Asian” (read: CGI yellow-face). They failed. But they tried again, this time by straight-up altering the plot of the Ghost in the Shell story itself. The plot-twist of the remake is that Major is a Japanese mind in a white body. This is a change the filmmakers created in an attempt to justify whitewashing – it’s a change from the original story, the source material. It doesn’t stop there though. As a critic on Bustle explains, “It’s not just that Major is, essentially, a Japanese mind in the body of a white person, it’s that the white body is that of someone largely considered one of the most bankable movie stars and most beautiful people in the world — someone who has become a Hollywood beauty standard. In the film, Major’s body is the ultimate desire, the pinnacle of mechanic ‘enhancements’ enjoyed by everyone in Ghost in the Shell.” In other words, Major’s white body is considered an improvement from Motoko’s Japanese one – a problematic subliminal message. Netflix, as if eager to partake in whitewashing, shared the news of its latest original film while Paramount’s Ghost in the Shell was still being criticized. The film is Death Note, an adaptation of the popular manga of the same name. Unlike Ghost in the Shell, Netflix’s Death Note is a completely westernized version of the original (similar to the remakes of Shall We Dance? and The Ring) – the cast has no Asians and the story is set in Seattle, instead of in Tokyo. This adjustment, however, is still problematic. The casting choices imply that an Americanized version of an Asian story means none of the cast can be Asian. Whatever happened to Asian-Americans? It is not as if there were no Asian-American actors available to be cast. Asian-American actor Edward Zo has been vocal about how he was openly told not to bother auditioning for the role of the protagonist, Light Yagami, because “they were not looking to see Asian actors for [that role]”. Asian-American actors were explicitly excluded from even being considered, despite Light Yagami, and the rest of the leading characters in Death Note, being Asian characters. In addition, the Japanese culture is integral to the story of Death Note. For instance, the Japanese school life culture largely affects the protagonist’s motivation in becoming a serial killer. It is also notable that the epicenter of what later becomes an international problem begins in Japan, and therefore the Japanese police force leads the investigation on the protagonist’s murders with the FBI acting as the backup force, (differing from stereotypical expectations). Furthermore, L, also a main character, is a person of mixed race – he is a quarter Japanese. Therefore it is meaningful that he, a mixed Japanese person, is the world’s number one detective, relied on by every country’s police force for solving the most difficult cases. Additionally, another one of the main characters, Ryuk, is a Shinigami – a death spirit particular to Japanese religion and culture. You wondering yet how Netflix is going to “Americanize” Ryuk? Here’s the thing; Americans cannot use the relatively positive reactions of Japanese people to justify whitewashing – in America. This is because Japan and the U.S. are very different countries demographically. While the U.S. is (for the most part) celebrated as a country of diversity, Japan generally prides itself in its apparent homogeneous population. Majority of the people in Japan are ethnically Japanese and homogeneous in appearance, and as a result there are no problems of “erasure” or “representation” like in the US – at least, not the same kind. In other words, Japanese people looking at a whitewashed Japanese film from a Japanese perspective, wouldn’t see anything wrong with it. In their minds, the thought process may be something akin to the following: Americans are mainly white. So, a remake of any film in the US would have a white person in the lead role. Just like how a Japanese remake would have an Asian person in the lead role, since Japanese actors are usually Asian. They don’t understand the stakes like Asian-Americans and other POCs do regarding whitewashing in the US, because they have never experienced it. They didn’t grow up as an ethnic minority in their home country, wondering why almost no one in the media looked like them. They didn’t grow up questioning the validity of their identities, while POCs still do because American media teaches them that to be American is to be white. They didn’t grow up with a media that whitewashed their voices, their stories, and their histories. Hence, Japanese condemnation of whitewashing, or lack thereof, does not matter; their reaction in no way validates said whitewashing."
ARTS & CULTURE,Adorable Portraits Explore The Lives Of Big-City Shop Cats,"Tamar Arslanian knows that shop cats aren’t just cute, they can play a vital role in a city like New York that can feel a bit cold and brutal at times. It all started when she started posting photos of two shop cats in her neighborhood — Jack, who lives at a wine shop and Kitty, who resides at a pilates studio — on social media, and was overwhelmed by the enthusiasm and interest of her fellow New Yorkers. Many of them had favorite local shop cats of their own. “It’s then I began to realize how pervasive shop cats were in the city, and the important role they played in adding a touch of warmth – a sense of community even – in a place that can sometimes feel overwhelming and impersonal,” she told HuffPost in an email. That realization inspired Arslanian to write “Shop Cats of New York,” a book that explores the lesser-known lives of the city’s most adored felines. She teamed up with photographer Andrew Marttila, who shot gorgeous portraits of the book’s furry stars. Arslanian had some important criteria for which cats she included. “First and foremost, I wanted to to feel confident the cats were well cared for and beloved,” she said. As it turns out, she was pleasantly surprised by just how great the cats’ lives seemed to be. “My biggest ‘ah ha’ was realizing the level of stimulation and attention these cats received in comparison to most house cats, mine included,” she said. “I see my cats for about an hour before work and a few hours in the evenings during the week, but I can’t say I’m actively playing with them for very long. It made me realize the level of enrichment these cats were receiving on a daily basis. In some ways they could be viewed as having fuller lives than most cats living in more traditional homes.” That’s one reason why Arslanian would like to see more animal shelters and rescue groups be open to adopting out cats to businesses, not just traditional residences. “Businesses could be vetted as are most adopters, and assessed to ensure the business and cat are a good fit for one another,” she said, noting that of course not all cats have personalities that would be suited to that environment. See a selection of Marttila’s photos from the book below."
ARTS & CULTURE,Margaret Atwood Responds To Cast's Claim That 'Handmaid's Tale' Isn't A Feminist Story,"It’s difficult to talk about “The Handmaid’s Tale,” Hulu’s adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s famous dystopia, without bringing up the story’s eerie relevance to contemporary politics. It is, after all, centered on a dictatorial regime hellbent on policing women’s bodies. This was certainly the case during a panel discussion at Tribeca Film Festival on Friday night, during which many of the show’s cast and crew were asked how they felt about the political aspects of the series, set to premiere on April 26. When asked whether or not the story’s feminist themes in particular were part of the reason some of the actors were attracted to the project, the answers were somewhat surprising.  “Any story about a powerful woman owning herself in any way is automatically deemed feminist,” Madeline Brewer, who plays handmaid Janine, told audiences after a screening of the show’s first episode. “This is a story about a woman. I don’t think this is feminist propaganda. I think this is a story about women and about humans. The three people hanging on the wall were all men. This story affects all people.” “I really echo what Maddie said before,” Elisabeth Moss, who plays Offred, said. “It’s not a feminist story, it’s a human story, because women’s rights are human rights. I never intended to play Peggy [from ‘Mad Men’] as a feminist and I never expected to play Offred as a feminist.” A few members of the audience, including MTV culture writer Rachel Handler, took to Twitter to express their concern with Moss and Brewer’s claims. bizarre Handmaid's Tale panel at Tribeca. Cast stressing over and over again that it's ""not a feminist story, it's a human story."" exactly. I don't blame the cast, I blame whatever white male suit was like ""play down the feminist shit."" https://t.co/uRsg45IhT8 Watch the show y'all, it's v good. Just want Hulu's marketing dudes 2 get the message that feminism isn't a dirty word or a bad PR strategy. https://t.co/OGIQn2lGh8 In response, another Twitter user thought it wise to see what Atwood, the keeper of the source material, thought: .@MargaretAtwood Your thoughts? https://t.co/HRMFsXaQLC @KarmaLovesGumbo They needed an ""only,"" an ""also,"" and a human rights definition of the F word, imho. Atwood didn’t necessarily refute the cast’s claim, but rather edited it to be more in line with a human rights-centric definition of feminism, one that many contemporary feminists already adhere to. “It’s not only a feminist story,” she’d have them say, “it’s also a human story.” In an earlier essay for The New York Times titled “Margaret Atwood on What ‘The Handmaid’s Tale’ Means in the Age of Trump,” the author weighed in on whether or not she considered her novel to be feminist. [I]s “The Handmaid’s Tale” a “feminist” novel? If you mean an ideological tract in which all women are angels and/or so victimized they are incapable of moral choice, no. If you mean a novel in which women are human beings — with all the variety of character and behavior that implies — and are also interesting and important, and what happens to them is crucial to the theme, structure and plot of the book, then yes. In that sense, many books are “feminist.” Moss has taken a similar position in past interviews. On stage on Friday, she described her character’s actions and thoughts as being motivated simply by a desire to survive and reunite with her daughter ― not necessarily a cemented vision of feminism. “For me, I don’t approach anything with a political agenda,” she added. “I approach it from a very human place, I hope.” While several members of the cast seemed less willing to discuss politics point blank during the Tribeca panel, Ann Dowd, who plays a complex villain in “Handmaid’s Tale,” did not mince words. When asked what kind of impact she’d like the show to have on viewers. “I hope it has a massive effect on people,” she said. “I hope they picket the White House and I hope they’re wearing [’Handmaid’s Tale’] costumes.” Her advice to fans who want to view “The Handmaid’s Tale” as a politically-charged warning was made clear: “Stay awake. Stay awake. And don’t for a minute think, well, I’ll get involved some other time. I won’t worry about the midterm election. I’ll just... no, no, no. Don’t wait. Just stay awake.”"
ARTS & CULTURE,French Artist Hatches Live Chicks And Avoids Egg On His Face,"French artist Abraham Poincheval, who famously spent a week inside a rock and two weeks inside a bear sculpture, has succeeded in hatching chicken eggs after incubating them for some three weeks. Poincheval embarked on his latest project in late March of imitating a mother hen by incubating some 10 eggs with his own body heat inside a glass vivarium at Paris’ Palais de Tokyo contemporary art museum. At the time, he estimated it would take 21-26 days for the eggs to hatch and the first did so on Tuesday. A spokeswoman for the museum said on Thursday nine had hatched and the chicks were on their way to a farm.  For the endeavor, Poincheval sat on a chair, wrapped in an insulating blanket, over a container with the eggs. He could leave his seat for no more than 30 minutes a day for meals. Earlier this year, the artist spent a week inside a block of stone, while in 2014, he lived in a hollowed-out bear sculpture for two weeks."
ARTS & CULTURE,"You Can Soon Buy Tickets To The 'Mean Girls' Musical, You Pathetic Loser","Good news, people who were in high school in 2004 and still feel like they are in high school in 2017. “Mean Girls,” Tina Fey’s classic comedy exploring the many creative ways young women torture one another to rise up on the food chain of popularity, is headed to Broadway. But first, it’s stopping in D.C.  What is the 411? Tickets to #MeanGirlsDC go on sale on FRIDAY, APRIL 28! Sign up and we'll remind you. Link in bio. A post shared by Mean Girls Broadway (@meangirlsbway) on Apr 18, 2017 at 9:37am PDT On April 28, tickets go on sale for the world premiere of the highly anticipated musical adaptation, which follows fresh blood Cady Heron who, after starting at a new school in Illinois, is seemingly adopted by a trio of popular girls called The Plastics. Spoiler alert: they aren’t very nice.  The Broadway plot description sounds pretty familiar: After years of living with her zoologist parents in Africa, Cady Heron moves to Illinois and must find where she fits in the social hierarchy. A sweet, naive newbie, Cady quickly attracts the attention of The Plastics, a trio of popular frenemies led by the vicious and calculating Regina George. When Cady devises a plan to end Regina’s reign, she learns that you can’t cross a Queen Bee without getting stung. Thankfully, Fey herself adapted the “Mean Girls” screenplay for the stage, so it’s probably sticking true to the original. Jeff Richmond, the Emmy-winning composer with TV credits like “30 Rock” and “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt” under his belt (who’s also Fey’s husband), wrote the music, with lyrics by Tony Award nominee Nell Benjamin.  Tony Award winner Casey Nicholaw is directing and choreographing the show. Lorne Michaels is co-producing, because of course he is. “Mean Girls” will premiere at the National Theatre in Washington, D.C., on Oct. 31, and travel to Broadway soon after. Our advice: Dress appropriately."
ARTS & CULTURE,Ivanka Trump Will Skip Her Book Tour Due To Ethical Concerns,"Ivanka Trump’s Women Who Work: Rewriting the Rules for Success is out May 2, but the author won’t be touring to promote her latest title.  Plus, citing ethical concerns, she’ll be donating the proceeds from the book to the National Urban League and the Boys & Girls Clubs of America.  Due to her role as an unpaid advisor to her father, the president of the United States, financial gain from her personal business would conflict with her governmental duties. President Obama, for example, only collected royalties from his first two books while in office; the third book, Of Thee I Sing: A Letter to My Daughters, was written during his time in the White House, so the proceeds were donated to charity.  There’s further precedent for president-adjacent authors forgoing profit from their books; both Barbara Bush and Hillary Clinton did just that. If anything, Ivanka Trump’s choice to donate these earnings solidifies the official professional relationship between her and her father, Bloomberg reports.  While she’s skipping out on an official promotional book tour, Trump will, however, visit Berlin on her first official international trip, where she’ll be on a panel closely related to the topic of her forthcoming title: women and empowerment in the workplace.  Still, the move to donate rather than directly profit from the platform afforded by governmental appointment is more ethically sound than previous decisions made by the Trump administration. Last summer, HuffPost’s Christina Wilkie reported that President Donald Trump said the proceeds of his book, Crippled America, would go to charity, but the then-candidate later disclosed that he earned between $1 and $5 million from the project. And, last October, HuffPost reported that Trump was using small donors’ money to purchase copies of his own book The Art of the Deal, resulting in personal royalties from the sales. Ultimately, if Ivanka Trump’s donations do make it to the charities she’s named, the move is in keeping with the established principles for books published by first family members. "
ARTS & CULTURE,Bill Murray Is A Classical Musician Now,"The line “Bill Murray stepped back from the microphone and closed his eyes in bliss” has probably been written or contemplated before.  The line “Yes, he was singing Gershwin with classical accompanists” has not. Until this week, that is, when The New York Times announced to the world that the “SNL” alum’s latest work, “New Worlds,” is actually a classical music project ― or “a program of songs and literary readings paired with chamber music,” to be more exact. For the project, which has been in the works since 2013, Murray sings songs like Stephen Foster’s “Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair” and tunes from “West Side Story.” He also reads Walt Whitman and Ernest Hemingway while cellist Jan Vogler’s trio plays Schubert, Bach and Piazzolla. Sounds like a gas! “New Worlds” will premiere at Festival Napa Valley in California on July 20, after which Murray will take the project on tour. (He’s coming to Carnegie Hall on Oct. 16, and they’ll be a recording release in August.) So, is Murray a good classical musician? Well, the short profile describes his voice as “a brassy growl.” The actor, in typical fashion, outlines his performance style modestly, and abstractly. “When they start playing,” he said, “the demand is so great that if you are attending to who you are right now, it brings out something that you couldn’t have visualized or planned for. You hear all those other voices saying, ‘That didn’t sound like Tony Bennett,’ or, ‘That B flat’s not going to break a light bulb.’ But they’re receding. They’re gone.” We can’t wait for Jonathan Schwartz’s take on the whole thing. It’ll be epic."
ARTS & CULTURE,Bill O’Reilly's Book Publisher Says It Will Continue To Support Him,"Although an investigation into his alleged sexual harassment has led to Bill O’Reilly’s dismissal from Fox News, the right-wing media personality will still have a platform, courtesy of his book publisher. Publisher’s Weekly reported Wednesday that Henry Holt ― an imprint of Macmillan ― “has no intention of altering its support of the bestselling author.”  Just last month, O’Reilly released a commercial successfully book through Henry Holt called Old School: Life in the Sane Lane. The book ― a sendup of progressive values, from trigger warnings to safe spaces ― begins with a quiz, wherein readers can determine whether they’re “Old School,” or a “Snowflake.”  Questions range from the politically divisive (“If someone wishes you ‘Merry Christmas’ what’s your immediate response?”) to the smug (“If you happen upon a raging warehouse fire late at night, do you: a) Hope the firefighters are safe and express concern for the people who work there during the day. b) Get out of your car and take a selfie with the fire in the background?”)  Henry Holt has an unnamed September release co-authored by O’Reilly; so far, the publisher says “plans have not changed” for the title. The imprint’s other recent releases include Elizabeth Warren’s This Fight is Our Fight and Coretta Scott King’s My Life, My Love, My Legacy.  It’s unclear whether the publisher’s decision to keep O’Reilly on its list is inspired by commercial or ethical aims. Publisher’s Weekly points out that O’Reilly was the bestselling adult nonfiction author of 2016; his book Killing the Rising Sun sold over 1 million copies in print. With the ability to tout his titles on his show, he had the sort of built-in fan base that a debut author might not. But, a book market expert predicts that his sales will decline, especially from casual fans and women readers.   On the other hand, free speech organizations such as the National Coalition Against Censorship ― which stood by Milo Yiannopoulos’ book before the title was pulled ― would likely argue that cutting ties with O’Reilly would be a violation of his rights. Yiannopoulos’ book was cancelled after the “alt-right” personality made a comment condoning pedophilia. Either the statement was finally an ethical breach the publisher was unwilling to accept, or it turned Yiannopoulos into a long-term financial liability. Most likely, it was some combination of the two.  Regardless, O’Reilly’s charges seem not to have warranted such action just yet. "
ARTS & CULTURE,"Weird, People Are Protesting An Art Performance Featuring 500 Liters Of Bull Blood","Even in the proudly freaky domain of performance art, Hermann Nitsch is an odd bird. Since the 1960s, his pagan performances have incorporated the carcasses, blood and entrails of slaughtered animals into elaborate aesthetic rituals resembling botched orgies or alien religious ceremonies. The Austrian artist, who has been arrested three times for his work, is no stranger to controversy. Nitsch’s newest performance, part of his ongoing “Orgy Mystery Theater” series, just might be his most gag-reflex-triggering yet. The three-hour piece, titled “150.Action,” will feature 500 liters of bull blood as well as an actual slaughtered bull.  “Action” participants, who Nitsch calls “disciples,” are invited to dress in white and engage with the bloody mess by bathing in blood, butchering dead animals, whatever floats your boat. The performance will involve a bizarre buffet of blood, semen and guts, a visceral event at once pleasurable, horrifying, pornographic, spiritual and grotesque.  Nitsch’s work is slated to run in June as part of the Museum of Old and New Art’s Dark Mofo festival in Tasmania, but a petition by Animal Liberation Tasmania is calling on the Hobart city council to ban the literal blood bath.  The appeal reads: “We are opposed to this event, which trivializes the slaughter of animals for human usage, and condemns a sentient being to death in the pursuit of artistic endeavors.” It had received over 9,000 signatures at the time of this article’s publication.  Though an actual bull will need to be killed for this debauched sensory overload, Dark Mofo creative director Leigh Carmichael told ABC Radio Hobart that reports of a “live slaughter” are incorrect. Instead, the animal will be “slaughtered humanely” at a local butchery before the performance, he explained, adding that the blood used in the performance would also be locally sourced.  Despite this clarification, Peter West, the general manager of animal welfare group RSPCA Tasmania, is still concerned with what will happen to the carcass after it’s slaughtered. “I think the difficulty we have is the respect shown to the animal with this action, that’s the challenge that we have with this particular artwork,” West told Guardian Australia. “It’s clearly not respectful to the beast and even though it has been humanely and respectfully dispatched, what happens after that is anything but respectful.” Surely no bull wants its life to end with a crowd of young art enthusiasts bathing in its blood, but for Nitsch, such an action evokes intensified sensations that are often muted in everyday life, feelings that get to the core of what it means to be a human being. “I want my work stir up the audience, the participants of my performances,” the artist told Hyperallergic in 2014. “I want to arouse them by the means of sensual intensity and to bring them an understanding of their existence. Intensity is an awakening into being.” As of now, Dark Mofo remains unsurprised by the controversy Nitsch’s performance has provoked and has no plans to cancel the performance. As Carmichael explained, the festival will “not shy away from presenting work that challenges us to consider the ethical implications of our actions both today, and in the past... Some artists use paint, he uses blood and meat.” Barring cancelation, Nitsch’s “150.Action” will run in Hobart as part of Dark Mofo from June 8 to June 21. “Action” attendees ― all of whom must be 18 years or older ― may even be able to feast on the freshly butchered meat itself, if the museum can sort out the details with Australian health and safety regulations."
ARTS & CULTURE,Artist Gives Historical Women Of Color The Glorious Crowns They Deserve,"In Nicaraguan artist Ivette Cabrera’s delicate drawings, women real and imagined don elaborate headdresses. The black, white and red crowns transcend fashion trends and sovereign traditions, resembling weightless, geometric diagrams ― part botanical, part architectural ― that allude to the endless, blossoming potential of its wearers. They are material and immaterial, regal and boundless.  Cabrera first began contemplating the series while researching the Sandinista National Liberation Front, the democratic socialist party in Nicaragua that overthrew the country’s president in 1979, establishing a revolutionary government in its place. Women played a vital role in the revolution, serving in government, enacting social programs and joining the ranks of the local guerrilla groups. While delving into the Nicaraguan history that propelled her mother to migrate to the United States, Cabrera discovered a photograph that grabbed her attention.  The photo depicted a Sandinista woman wearing a rifle slung around her shoulder while breastfeeding a child. “The image made me realize,” Cabrera explained to The Huffington Post, “that women are both warriors and creators, fighters and powerful yet fragile enough to care for human life.” This image and the paradoxical ideas of womanhood it embodied compelled Cabrera to think about the societal standards women have been held to regardless of time, place or tradition. “We are much more capable than the roles society places on us,” she said, “but it takes an awareness of our own personal identity within that societal structure to really grow as a human so we can create a more balanced future for ourselves. Our history of oppression has had cataclysmic effects that has molded the identity of women today, especially to women of color.” Cabrera’s background is in architecture; she worked in renovations and residential building design for most of her life. She is more inspired by architects like Frank Lloyd Wright, Zaha Hadid and Rennie Mackintosh than fine artists, by movements like Brutalism and Constructivism than those found in art history books. “Some of my work is inspired by artists of the Post-Graffiti and Futurism movements along with some older artists from Art Nouveau such as Victor Horta, Erte, Alphonse Mucha and Gaudi,” Cabrera added. In 2013 she taught herself how to draw portraits, incorporating elements of her architectural design concepts for buildings into visionary headdresses fit for a warrior and a queen.  Before beginning a work, Cabrera scours thrift stores, hunting for old architecture books. She flips through them, looking for certain details she can incorporate into her unorthodox headpieces ― whether a certain use of negative space, line or composition. She works on toned paper with archival ink, marker, graphite and charcoal, sometimes using a magnifying glass to perfect the smaller details. Each drawing takes weeks or even months to complete, and Cabrera will start a piece over if the portraits don’t sufficiently capture the essences of their subjects.  Currently, Cabrera is working on a series titled “Monarch,” focusing on historical icons like Hadid, the iconic Iraqi-born British architect, and Wu Zetian, a 7th-century empress and the only woman to rule China. These sovereign inspirations are crowned with airy and expansive coronets that combine the airiness of butterfly wings with the expansive power of a yawning cathedral.  Through the drawings, Cabrera hopes to highlight the discrepancy between the roles women are often expected to fulfill and the true potential they possess. As the artist explained: “The biggest message that I hope to communicate to my viewers is to honor their inner strength and individuality, not to conform to the societal rules, and to see yourself as powerful and beautiful. Don’t buy into the system that tells you how you should be, act or what you should look like.”"
ARTS & CULTURE,Los Angeles' Getty Center To Reopen After Bomb Threat,"Los Angeles’ Getty Center will reopen at its usual time on Wednesday after a bomb threat caused the museum to close early.  Around 3 p.m. on Tuesday, museum officials contacted Los Angeles Police Department after receiving a threatening phone call. They did not formally evacuate the building, but advised those inside to leave. The threat caused the museum to close early, around 4:15 p.m.  Getty Center is closing early today due to threatening phone call.

ARTS & CULTURE,Old Hollywood Portraits Capture Stars In Candid Moments Between Takes,"Twentieth Century Fox had been accumulating behind-the-scenes portraits of its stars for decades before it decided to gather them all together in an archive in 1997. The candid photos ― production stills captured by various photographers over the years ― caught actors like Marilyn Monroe, Lena Horne, Cary Grant and Doris Day in between takes as they posed in glamorous costumes or awaited makeup in their bathrobes.  In one photo, Monroe stares absent-mindedly beyond the camera, a comb at her chin and a towel concealing her hair. With her cat-eye glasses and just a hint of that platinum hairdo peeking out, she’s as stunning as ever ― maybe more so. She’s not pouting or smiling in character, but merely gazing out. Without the sheen of a posed portrait, she appears human, frozen in a moment of being herself. Over 150 of these photos, oozing with Golden Age nostalgia, appear in the book Styling the Stars: Lost Treasures From the Twentieth Century Fox Archive. Written by former child star Angela Cartwright and actor Tom McLaren (with a foreword from the great Maureen O’Hara), the book is a tribute to the forgotten film stills that tell a decades-old story the public was never permitted to see. Today, actors and film crews share endless amounts of behind-the-scenes photos, giving fans a taste of the intimate environment of a movie set. But in the 1930s or the 1970s, the so-called continuity photos, snapped by photographers on set to ensure that actors’ wardrobe and makeup remained consistent from one shot to the next, were the only rare bits of documentation studios collected. The only remnants of a time period when film studios operated like small towns. “Because these [continuity photos] were not promotional shots, the actors wore a variety of expressions that often showed their personalities,” Cartwright writes. “Some were very serious, some clowned around, some posed like models, and some paid little attention at all, showing that it was merely a mundane part of the job. These photos often show the actor in a truly candid moment.” According to Cartwright, over time, many photos intended for the archive have been lost, misplaced or stolen. While Twentieth Century Fox struck a deal with UCLA in 1973, providing the film department access to the 6,500 boxes of continuity shots and other materials saved in exchange for storage space, it wasn’t until the late ‘90s that the photo archive was organized. Cartwright and McLaren managed to uncover a trove of negatives throughout their research in the archive, reprinted in Styling the Stars alongside anecdotes from movies past. See a preview of the book below, including forgotten shots of Rita Moreno, Rock Hudson, Candice Bergen and more.

ARTS & CULTURE,Nuart Aberdeen 2017 Already Has Locals Saying 'Haste Ye Back!',"The sky is still twilight blue above the streets of Aberdeen at 21:00 this time of year and as you walk the city’s edge on the beach of the North Sea the winds pick up with a chilly bluster. Of course, that’s just for this minute. In a half hour it may be a gentle warm caress, or  you’ll be pelted with hail and sleet mercilessly. Locals like to say that this northern Scottish seaside city has 4 seasons in one day.  During one Street Art tour that we gave for 350 Aberdeenians on the day  before Easter, we cycled through those seasons, twice. This is Nuart, the festival begun in Stavanger, Norway in 2001 by loveable bad boy and (some would argue) curatorial visionary Martyn Reed which invites Street Artists from around the world to partake in thoughtful aesthetic excursions on the street and in public space. The cumulative success of Nuart’s indoor/outdoor programs is now  well recorded and looked to as a model. Remarkably they have risen despite tensions that occur when commingling frameworks of illegality and institutional acceptance; including a relatively new academic rigor  that is now investigating the family of practices called Urban Art,  their absorption into the commercial market as contemporary art, the badass anti-establishment musings of jilted outcasts who want nothing of it, and a somewhat romantic notion of communicating with the public in a meaningful dialogue. Ah, but this is the bumpy, potholed, slimy street along which  counter-culture becomes culture and the marginalized becomes the mainstream – producing a modicum of nausea for all involved. While not explicitly aiming for legitimacy on these fronts, the Nuart Festival has gradually metamorphosed into a standard  by which some others are judged, with reason. Now for the first time Nuart exports its hard won and uniquely prickly formula in a perhaps more reserved manner to this new, old city which lies 500 kilometers across the North Sea in Scotland. This is the stirring, storied North Sea known globally for the black  oil lurking beneath it, and the two cities of Stavanger and Aberdeen have both been impacted greatly by the plunge of world-wide petroleum  prices since the end of the last decade; a downturn described by  London’s Telegraph as “vicious”.  We may have stumbled upon evidence of this during one of our walking  tours when we remarked on the large number of people there who were  interested in seeing the new artworks and one woman cracked with some sarcasm, “that’s because none of us has jobs.” And here we are with eleven international artists to ease the  grayness of this historic and granite city by the sea where daffodils cover the meadow in Union Terrace Gardens and single malt whisky eases the sight of iron leg fetters in the 17th century prison  museum called Tolbooth. When it comes to Nuart Aberdeen the people whom we met are nearly  exuberant in their responses, even awestruck by the appearance of this new art in their city. With the introduction of aerosol, brush paint, wheat-paste, stencils, miniature sculpture, and poetry to street walls,  it is as if a hidden pent-up desire for art in the public sector has  burst open, a geyser if you will. “I think there are quite a lot of places now in Aberdeen that are  quite plain. It’s like there are a lot of empty canvasses. It’s good to see something be done with them,” says Mark, who’s touring the new pieces through the streets with Julia, who’s originally from the capital  Edinburgh. Map in hand, the couple appears to be about 30 and they say  that while they’ve seen work like this in other cities, they’re glad to see something more youthful now appearing here in a historical seaport that boasts soaring, turreted and spired cathedrals and narrow stone  streets. “I’ve been to Leipzig lots of times and there’s lots of sides of  buildings,” says Mark, “they’re similar in size to these, with lots of murals in the city center, and it really kind of brightens the place up, makes it a lot more lively.” “Welcome to a city investing it its city and its culture,” says Councilor George Adam, the Lord Provost, a prestigious post and an  ancient office with its roots in the 13th century. During a  reception with other members of the Aberdeen City Council and the local business improvement district (BID) named “Aberdeen Inspired,” Mr. Adams says that he is excited by Nuart and has received a lot of positive  feedback as well. Indeed, the reception from youth, middle aged and senior patrons at our 14 short-video film lecture and the sold-out screening of the  premiere of “Finding Bansky” at the independent art theater Belmont  Filmhouse was ardent, enthusiastic and full of inquiries afterward. The  walking tours had more people than anyone had predicted, with a few people using canes and others pushed in strollers. It would appear that  the worldwide Street Art phenomena had seemed frustratingly out of reach  for some of the young people, who have been fascinated by it from afar.  Seeing these works by international artists here in their city was like  a jolt of electricity. During an entertaining slide show by festival participant Julian De Casabianca at the Lecture Theatre at the Anatomy Museum Thursday night, the steeply angled seats held a full capacity crowd, with many sitting  on the floor and steps. The somewhat inebriated and raucous artists and  students in their twenties hooted and hollered and pounded on desks  during the 50 minute lecture which included mobsters, murder, the  Holocaust, stolen artworks, and Street Art – specifically the museum art  images which De Casabianca has been wheat-pasting on public streets for  all to see for the last decade or so called “The Outings Project.” Martin Reed’s curation of the program is wise and the selections are  contextual from the perspective that Nuart Aberdeen 2017 presents an array of disciplines from a solid thoughtful selection of perspectives, each attached to the history of graffiti and Street Art from their  unique evolution of practices – as well as to the culture of Aberdeen. Germany’s Herakut dominates one concave wall of Aberdeen Market overlooking “The Green” with their improvisational blending of  illustration style portraiture, textual flourish, and symbols germane to the city. De Casabianca chose images form the Aberdeen Art Gallery of  two children – haunting in a narrow street known by local folklore for  ghosts of children who were sold as slaves to America in previous  centuries. Belgium’s Jaune peppers doorways and electrical boxes with multi-layer stencils of fluorescent-vested municipal workers in humorous  scenarios. These are partnered in scale by small grey-suited and somber  businessmen by Spain’s Isaac Cordal, which are hidden before your eyes  and camouflage into the daily city until you discover one standing on a  ledge, balancing on an electrical line, or sitting atop a CCTV camera. Norway’s Martin Whatson has perhaps the most obvious reference to the locality, with a golfing figure swiping into a plume of colorful  graffiti tags. With Donald Trump’s golf course only minutes away, the  piece raises an immediate association with a guy who is heartily disliked here. The Street Artist named Add Fuel create an enormous tile-patterned wall  that refers to local motifs and decorative artisans on a wall that can be seen easily by pedestrians looking from Aberdeen’s Union Bridge the largest single-span granite arch in the world. Italy’s Alice Pasquini brings imagery of the harbor into her figurative pieces and Norway’s  Nipper works directly with local artists to compile gifts of art posted  on clipboards around the city. This is not to say that Reed is running from possible controversial material or opinion: Poland stencilist M-City is without doubt  critiquing the oil industry with his oil barrels flying through the sky and tankers in the sea, the UK poet Robert Montgomery’s piece addresses  topics like the definition of modernism, race, and social equality, and Australia’s Fintan Magee’s very large mural diptych obliquely references rising sea levels and man made environmental degradation. In review of the successful event and the relatively young history  of the Street Art movement as one that is continually in motion, a few  points come to mind as worth mentioning: The first is the ongoing discussion of illegal graffiti and Street Art culture giving way to legal mural festivals that have as their aim some form of business  improvement and/or gentrification in a city, particularly when a city previously persecuted and derided the organic and illegal artists who  began the scene. This situation is not specific to Aberdeen, but the concern probably  will come up in conversations (including during panel discussions at  Nuart) and at the very least it is an irony that art practices once  reviled or verboten are now to some extent embraced as worthwhile  because they can be economically advantageous. These are not direct relationships, but close ones certainly. Similarly there have been a few so-called Street Art festivals in  recent years where the primary driver is commercial brand-building and while they give opportunities to artists they somehow cheapen the dialogue between people. It is always ironic, if inevitable, when a  subculture becomes more closely associated with mainstream culture, sometimes specifically because of its cache as being rebellious. The trick here would be to accommodate the activist voices in the program, and clearly Nuart aims to do so with panache. An argument could be made that counters the quick-on-the-draw “selling out” charge that says true rebels are somehow abandoning their values by working for “the man”. From our perspective, we’re happy when  artists are working, are treated fairly, and when people get to enjoy their work. Even in this second least affordable city in Scotland  where artist spaces are at a premium if not scarce altogether, it is a good development to see art on the walls outside and a public dialogue facilitated by art. This mural initiative will invariably jump-start two outcomes. One will be a renewed interest in the zone in which the art appears, driving foot traffic and, if all goes according to plan, new business initiatives and increased interest in the arts in general. Secondly, it will spur an uptick in locally grown Street Art. We already witnessed it mushrooming overnight on surfaces during the days we were in the city and were pleased to learn of many local artists who  have been looking for opportunities for exposure in addition to this one  and last years’ “Painted Doors” project, which was spearheaded by Aberdeen artist Mary Butterworth. As this local scene continues to coalesce in public space, one hopes that  the city will challenge itself to find healthy and proactive ways to support this organic scene as well. Overall, the first year of Nuart Aberdeen has been hands-down successful by many standards, and talk of a 2018 program has already  started popping up in discussions online and elsewhere. From what we could see and hear, the city is longing for more. “We want you all back! You showed us what can be done!” says Dr.  Fiona-Jane Brown, the author of “Hidden Aberdeen” and founder of Graft  Theater Company in her comment on Facebook to the Nuart team. “Haste ye back, loons and quinies!” says Morag Russell, another  Facebook commenter as the Nuart artists, production team and assorted  misfits say their final goodbyes in a posting.  The sentiment rings just  as sweet at the song it comes from, like this version from Scotland’s legendary entertainer Andy Stewart We would like to express our gratitude for the professionalism and support of the Nuart Team, to all the volunteers whose work and  dedication made our work more efficient and our stay a lot more  pleasant, to the team at Aberdeen Inspired and to the people of Aberdeen for being such gracious and generous hosts, and to all the artists  whose work we love and admire and for your inspiration and talent. Thank you. We hope to meet again next year.

ARTS & CULTURE,Kevin Spacey Is Here To Save The 71st Annual Tony Awards,"From a murderous politico to charming emcee: Kevin Spacey, star of stage and screen, has been announced as the host of the 71st Annual Tony Awards. Breaking News: Tony winner @KevinSpacey will host the 71st Annual #TonyAwards on Sun, June 11! https://t.co/xt8ZcmdWOI pic.twitter.com/DIEp1I1C4F Spacey, who currently stars in the hit Netflix series “House of Cards” as Frank Underwood, a scheming Southern Democrat with an unquenchable thirst for power, will take the stage at Radio City Music Hall on June 11 for the live CBS telecast of the awards show. The TV, film, and theater actor is a veteran of award shows. In 1991, he won a Tony for Best Featured Actor in a Play for his performance in Neil Simon’s “Lost in Yonkers.” He’s also taken home two Oscars, for his work in “The Usual Suspects” and “American Beauty.”  In comparison to the Academy Awards and the Emmys, the Tony Awards can be viewed as a relatively niche award show, honoring performances and productions many outside of the New York metropolitan area haven’t had the opportunity to witness. Its viewership is typically smaller: In February, the unexpectedly eventful Oscars broadcast garnered 32.9 million viewers, while the 2016 Tony Awards tallied 8.7 million viewers.  Even that modest award-show viewership may prove to be an outlier for the Broadway awards, which have garnered around 7 million viewers in previous years. The 2016 awards, hosted by late-night host James Corden, saw a 35 percent increase in viewership that many attributed to the national obsession with Lin-Manuel Miranda’s “Hamilton.” Not only did the show clean up at the Tonys, but viewers were treated to a number from the musical ― without having to mortgage their house for an elusive ticket. Now that the year of “Hamilton” has passed, producers fear that the audiences will leave, according to ABC. Can CBS hope to retain those gains in audience by leading with A-list host Frank Underwood Kevin Spacey? That remains to be seen ― and we’re willing to wait for it. (Sorry, “Hamilton” fans.)"
ARTS & CULTURE,Stephen Colbert Is Turning One Of His Popular Segments Into A Book,"“Late Show” host Stephen Colbert is a longtime evangelist of new books. During his tenure at “The Colbert Report,” he hosted authors like National Book Award winner Phil Klay, and literary darlings Toni Morrison, John Green and Michael Chabon. Now, Colbert is coming out with his own book ― his sixth, including a co-written title in 2004, and the 2012 children’s book I Am a Pole (And So Can You!). Colbert’s latest ― Midnight Confessions ― is based on the “Late Show” segment of the same name, where the host finds time for “one of his favorite Catholic rituals” by sitting in a makeshift confessional and substituting the audience for a priest. The book will include his confessions as well as audience submissions, and will be released by Simon and Schuster on Sept. 5, Hollywood Reporter writes."
ARTS & CULTURE,Broadway's New Princess Elsa Is Absolute Fire (And Ice),"Big news, “Frozen” fans and their legal guardians. Last year, we learned the much worshipped and irrationally catchy Disney musical would grace the Broadway stage in the spring of 2018. Today, Disney Theatrical Productions announced the cast of the highly anticipated production. Meet your newest Disney princess.  Playing Elsa, the role immortalized by Idina Menzel, is vocal powerhouse Caissie Levy. Like Menzel, Levy has previously played Elphaba in “Wicked.” Her other roles include Fantine in “Les Mis,” Molly in “Ghost” and Sheila in “Hair.”   Judging by this 2015 video of Levy singing “Let It Go” ― as mashed up with The Beatles’ “Let It Be” ― families lucky enough to see Levy belt out the ballad in person are in for a serious treat.  Levy will be joined on tage by some truly magical talent. Playing the role of Anna, as played in the movie by Kristen Bell, is Patti Murin. Her previous parts include Glinda in “Wicked” and Lysistrata in “Lysistrata Jones.” Along with the leading ladies, the cast also features Jelani Alladin as Kristoff, John Riddle as Hans, Greg Hildreth as Olaf and Robert Creighton as the Duke of Weselton.  We still have quite a while until winter hits Broadway. In the meantime, “Frozen” will run an “out-of-town tryout” at the Buell Theatre in the Denver Center for the Performing Arts this fall, from Aug. 17 through Oct. 1, 2017. Single tickets for performances in Denver go on sale May 1, and tickets for Broadway performances will go on sale later this year."
ARTS & CULTURE,Trump Urges Twitter Followers To Read A Completely Blank Book,"On Monday, at 8:13 a.m., President Donald Trump published a surprising tweet. Surprising for two reasons, in fact: Firstly, it recommended a book of “Reasons to Vote for Democrats” to his followers, and secondly, it recommended a book. Had the president been hacked? What could account for such an uncharacteristic tweet? Not to worry ― it all makes complete sense. Reasons to Vote for Democrats: A Comprehensive Guide by Michael J. Knowles is neither pro-Democrat nor, in the traditional sense, a book. It’s a 266-page volume filled with empty pages. (Get it? There are no reasons to vote for Democrats!) A great book for your reading enjoyment: ""REASONS TO VOTE FOR DEMOCRATS"" by Michael J. Knowles. Knowles, who brought out Reasons to Vote for Democrats in February, is hardly the first to use this old gag ― even in this election cycle. For example, back in November, Why Trump Deserves Trust, Respect and Admiration by David King became available on Amazon. “This book is full of blank pages,” the description says. “Despite years of research, we could not find anything to say on this subject.” The author includes a helpful hint for what to do with all the clean, unused pages inside: “Please feel free to use this book for notes.” Good idea! Here’s hoping the trees that were pulped for these joke books were not chopped down in vain. Reasons to Vote for Democrats, despite being completely free of content, has been a top seller on Amazon for weeks. Thousands of consumers have snapped up $6 paperback copies, and the author, 26-year-old Knowles, was invited on “Fox and Friends” in March to discuss his creation. Setting aside the president’s deliberate trolling of the Democratic Party ― of which a significant percentage of his constituents identify as members ― Trump’s ringing endorsement of a book without any words beyond the table of contents struck some as almost too on-the-nose, given his notorious inability to name any books he has read all the way through.  Rare book-related tweet is for a book without words. https://t.co/AE5yjmgMPu It seems fitting that the only book President Trump has ever enjoyed reading is made up entirely of blank pages. https://t.co/uL3GcgEgFH Knowing what we know about Trump’s reading habits, it’s little wonder he might define “reading enjoyment” as “not having to read any words” ― now we just have confirmation."
ARTS & CULTURE,Huma Abedin Wants $2 Million For Her Memoir,"America has heard a lot from the two people closest to political staffer Huma Abedin: former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, whom she served as a top aide, and former congressman Anthony Weiner, her estranged husband. We haven’t heard much directly from Abedin herself, but that may change soon, as The Hollywood Reporter revealed that she is shopping a memoir. THR reports that Abedin has been speaking to publishers about the project, which she is pricing at up to $2 million. Given her central role in Clinton’s campaign and her marriage to Weiner, whose political career was repeatedly felled by sexting scandals, that price almost seems like a bargain. Compared to celebrity book deals like Lena Dunham’s ($3.5 million) or political book advances like Hillary Clinton’s post–White House deal ($8 million), a couple million doesn’t seem outrageous. That’s assuming Abedin plans to spill the dirt, of course. THR describes the work-in-progress as “a reflection on how her personal and professional lives collided during the campaign.” Her experience brings together two of the juiciest political stories of recent years ― Clinton’s failed presidential campaign and Weiner’s sexting scandals. Abedin separated from Weiner, with whom she has a young son, in August after news broke that he had sexted a woman while lying in bed with his son. The couple had previously remained together after two previous scandals, in 2011 and 2013, both surrounding his sexual exchanges on social media and via text. During an investigation into Weiner’s alleged sexting relationship with a 15-year-old girl, the FBI announced that it had turned up emails that may have been relevant to Clinton’s handling of confidential information on Weiner’s and Abedin’s devices. The revelation ― which came just days before the 2016 presidential election ― kept allegations that Clinton mishandled national security information fresh in voters’ minds and sent shock waves through the campaign. Abedin has never spoken candidly in public about her husband’s indiscretions, defaulting to an even-keeled silence that she has attributed to her desire to protect their son. Following the dramatic manner in which his digital offenses affected Clinton’s campaign, silence may seem like a less and less viable option."
ARTS & CULTURE,A One-Woman Show Explores The Fragmented Life Of Frida Kahlo,"A few years ago, Brazilian-born writer, actor and dancer Andrea Dantas heard back about her audition to dance flamenco on Madonna’s world tour. She didn’t get the job.  “I thought, ‘OK, you’re allowed to feel sorry for yourself for 10 minutes,’” Dantas told The Huffington Post. “After, I thought, ‘What do you want to do now? What do you want to do with your life?’ And I swear, I heard a voice that said ‘Frida,’ and I just knew.” The fruits of Dantas’ labor are currently on view at Brooklyn’s BAM Fisher, in a one-woman show called “Fragmented Frida.” Dantas plays the role of the iconic painter Frida Kahlo, starting as a young, awkward yet precocious child ― complete with a bowl cut and a limp ― and ending up as the most renowned woman artist of all time: braided hair, unibrow and all. Far more than Dantas focuses on the specifics of Kahlo’s artistic craft, she zooms in on her life story, an extraordinary journey riddled with hardship. At the age of 6, Kahlo was stricken with polio, leaving her right leg incapacitated and in tremendous pain. At 18 she was involved in a near-fatal bus crash, which left her pelvis crushed. While recovering, and spending most of her time in a wheelchair, Kahlo began to paint, famously declaring: “I don’t paint dreams or nightmares, I paint my own reality.” It was Kahlo’s incredible resilience that drew Dantas to her as a character. “At that time in Mexico, being a woman wasn’t cool, being a feminist wasn’t cool, divorcing a man wasn’t cool, being a bisexual wasn’t cool, being so free sexually was not cool at all,” Dantas said. “How did she manage to do so much in spite of all the illness and all the betrayals? How does the underdog become the hero?” Dantas read around 20 Kahlo biographies before writing the script, taking about eight months to research. She then trained with movement coach Thiago Felix to accurately convey how Kahlo moved through the world, crippled at various points by illness, injury and heartbreak. Even after receiving recognition for her dreamlike self-portraits, which translated her brutal physical and emotional wounds onto her painted flesh, Kahlo continued to suffer. After being told she could not conceive, she became pregnant, only to suffer a grisly miscarriage. She experienced infidelity on the part of her husband, painter Diego Rivera, most painfully with her own sister.  While today Kahlo is regarded as a figure of strength and courage, it was important for Dantas to capture the softer, more vulnerable aspects of her personality to show how, despite the mythical status she achieved, she was an emotional, fallible human being. “She had such a subtlety to her and a magnetism, she was a hopeless romantic,” Dantas said. “She was soft, she had a great sense of humor. It’s not just about the pain and the suffering. She was not a victim. This is a woman who, when her leg was amputated, the first thing she did was custom-make a boot for herself. She painted it red so everyone could see what was happening to her. She had an amazing zest for life.” Although Dantas could not have predicted the political climate in which her play would debut, the current moment seems to make its message all the more pressing. “In the 1930s Frida said: ‘If the American people rebelled against everything that is wrong here, this would be a very different place,’” Dantas said. “Even then, she always said that women matter, that the LGBTQ community matters, that art matters. All the craziness that is happening in the country regarding immigration, she would have a lot to say about that for sure.”  There have already been countless retrospectives, books, essays and films devoted to the life of Ms. Kahlo. Through “Fragmented Frida,” Dantas hopes to add her own perspective to the mix with a performance revolving around one particular thread of Kahlo’s many accomplishments: Her exceptional ability to turn vulnerability into strength. “She overcame so much,” Dantas said. “She shows, with certainty, there is nothing a person cannot overcome.” “Fragmented Frida,” directed by Christine Renee Miller, runs until Sunday, April 16, at BAM Fisher in Brooklyn, New York. "
ARTS & CULTURE,Help A Queens Museum Create A Permanent Home For Jim Henson's Muppets,"Kermit the Frog. Miss Piggy. Elmo. Cookie Monster. The Fraggles. You will soon have a chance to see these and plenty more beloved creatures in the flesh ― or rather, in the fuzz ― thanks to a comprehensive Jim Henson exhibition headed, permanently, to the Museum of Moving Image (MOMI) in New York.  The Museum launched a Kickstarter campaign on Tuesday, calling on all Henson buffs to help raise $40,000 to realize the creatively named “Jim Henson Exhibition” in all its glory. And boy did they deliver. In just two days, the museum met its initial mark. We can officially say, the show will happen.  Now they’re hoping to reach their “stretch goal” of $100,000, in order to welcome even more bug-eyed creatures with squeezable noses and unruly mops of hair into their new Queens home.  The permanent MOMI exhibition was first announced in 2013, with help from $2.75 million in backing from New York City, a place many muppets would have called home if they could talk. “Many of the Muppets who you’ve come to love were made right here in New York City,” Jim’s daughter Cheryl Henson said at the time. “They were sewn, glued, designed and built right here.” The money helped fund a 2,200-square-foot gallery on the museum’s second floor and ensure that it is puppet-proof.  Given the fact that the Jim Henson’s Creature Shop is based in Queens, the setting was a perfect spot for the muppets to settle down in.  This next round of fundraising is geared toward the restoration of the puppets themselves, around 40 of which will appear in the exhibition. The crop is any puppet-head’s dream come true, featuring original beasties from all the Henson classics: we’re talking “Sesame Street,” “The Muppet Show,” “Fraggle Rock,” “The Dark Crystal” and “Labyrinth.” The delicate creatures are to be spruced up by designers and builders at Henson’s legendary Creature Shop, where they’ll be preserved for future generations to ogle, as well.  If you’re not based in New York, worry not, a traveling version of “The Jim Henson Exhibition: Imagination Unlimited” is also slated to go on tour, starting off at Seattle’s Museum of Pop Culture on May 20.  Clarification: The Center for Puppetry Arts, based in Atlanta, also received a major donation from the family of Jim Henson and has a permanent exhibit devoted to Henson on view. The two exhibitions are not related. "
ARTS & CULTURE,Ballet Hispánico Is Giving Latino Artists A Voice They Deserve,"A small number of residents from Manhattan’s Upper West Side gathered in a community garden on Tuesday to watch as members of Ballet Hispánico posed for a photo shoot. The dancers were dressed in the costumes they’ll wear onstage at the Joyce Theater later this month, where they’ll be performing three works by Latina choreographers, all of whom are women.  Founded in 1970, Ballet Hispánico defines itself as a community-building institution dedicated to exploring the diversity of Latino culture, involving dancers and choreographers from Venezuela, Cuba, Trinidad, Puerto Rico, Mexico, Spain, Brazil, Argentina and Colombia in a mix of classical, Latin and contemporary dance. This year, its New York Season will not only celebrate the depth of expression found in the various corners of Latin America, it will shine light on the women creating art in a traditionally male-dominated field. “Ballet Hispánico was born out of the need to give voice to Latino/Latina artists at a time when they did not have a strong presence in mainstream performing arts,” Eduardo Vilaro, the artistic director of Ballet Hispánico since 2009, told The Huffington Post. Today, the company is taking its mission a step further, by choosing to honor the female choreographers who are seizing positions of leadership in dance: Michelle Manzanales, Annabelle Lopez Ochoa and Tania Pérez-Salas. “It is imperative that we nurture and give voice to those who may not have opportunities within the field,” Vilaro added. “By nurturing and celebrating the work of these Latina artists, Ballet Hispánico hopes to contribute to the process of making the dance field more equitable.” Vilaro’s sense of duty to marginalized voices is heightened, he says, by the company’s 46-year legacy in New York City. Since the 2015 opening of Ballet Hispánico’s Arnhold Center on 89th Street ― with its unmistakable banners and open windows ― the organization has embarked on a five-year plan to nurture its relationship with the neighborhood it calls home. It’s doing so by hosting free performances, outdoor events and Hispanic heritage celebrations. Judging by the public’s captivation upon seeing dancers like Melissa Fernandez and Lyvan Verdecia leaping in front of a nearby parking garage, local interest is pronounced. “The photo shoot certainly underlined the magic and richness of culture that Ballet Hispánico brings to the Upper West Side,” Vilaro added. “It is our duty to continue this legacy and build upon it as we navigate the terrain of today’s immigrant and race relations and the new challenges that our communities face.” Ahead of the company’s April 18 debut at the Joyce, HuffPost’s Damon Dahlen ventured to the Upper West Side to photograph members of Ballet Hispánico in the familiar spaces just beyond its front doors. Check out images of Fernandez, Verdecia and other members of the company paying tribute to their neighborhood in the best way they know how: through dance. Ballet Hispánico’s 2017 New York Season at the Joyce Theater will take place April 18-23, featuring “Con Brazos Abiertos” by Michelle Manzanales, “Línea Recta” by Annabelle Lopez Ochoa and “3 Catorce Dieciséis” by Tania Pérez-Salas."
ARTS & CULTURE,"Meet Pearl Mackie, The 20-Something Shaking Up 'Doctor Who'","When Pearl Mackie began the audition process for “Doctor Who,” she didn’t know she was auditioning for “Doctor Who.” She’d been starring in the West End production of “The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time” when her agent asked if she was available to tryout for a part in a show called “Mean Town.” With little more information, Mackie said she was free and agreed to wait for more details on the opportunity. When her agent contacted her again, she told the actress that “Mean Town” wasn’t actually a show, it was an anagram for “Woman Ten.” Turns out, Mackie wasn’t just auditioning for a poorly titled drama or sitcom, she was now in the running to become the newest female companion on “Doctor Who” Season 10.  “I was like, riiight, OK, I’m never gonna get that,” the London-born Mackie told The Huffington Post in a phone interview. Long story short, she did. After an initial audition, she performed lines alongside a theatrical Peter Capaldi, the resident Doctor entering into his final season as a time-traveling alien this year.  “He’s running pressing buttons and pulling levers, because he knows where everything is in the TARDIS,” Mackie recounted. “And I’m sort of just standing, open-mouthed, looking around in wonder, kind of thinking ― What is going on here? This is the maddest experience of my life. I’ve just had the most intense experience, and I can’t even tell anyone about it.” Secrecy is par for the course when it comes to the BBC show, which ran for 26 seasons between the 1960s and 1980s, only to return in a 2005 revival that’s about to air its Season 10 premiere on BBC America on April 15. But Mackie’s character, Bill Potts, is anything but traditional. According to The Guardian, she’ll be the show’s first openly gay companion, a woman who’s been described as “completely fresh and new,” perhaps due in part to the fact that the actress behind the role has never really watched more than one episode of the show. Check out our entire interview with Mackie, in which we talked about her character’s persona, the pressures of joining the “Doctor Who” family, and what representation on television means to her. I love your character’s name ― Bill. Is there anything behind the name? Is it short for anything? Well, no, not as far as I know. She’s just called Bill! I wondered the same, but I haven’t discovered anything, unless they’ve got big plans for a reveal later on. No, as far as I know, it’s just Bill. Fans have been speculating that Bill is from the ‘80s and that there might be a parallel to a former “Who” companion, Ace ― is any of this true? I’ve read that “Doctor Who” showrunner Steven Moffat has hinted otherwise. She is not from the ‘80s, no. She is very much from now. She’s very much a present-day woman. Kind of a normal young woman, really. Kind of a nod there, in her vintage-inspired outfits, but she’s definitely not from the ‘80s. Is there anything else you can tell us about Bill’s origins that won’t incite utter rage from the BBC? Yeah! In terms of personality, she’s very open and she’s very real. When I read Steven’s script, I was very struck by how fully rounded the character was. Not sort of struck in terms of being surprised by Steven’s writing ― because, I mean, we all know how good that is ― but it was very much more that I felt she was already there. She had a history. She felt like a real person that you would meet. And someone that you’d like. She’s quite open. She’s quite honest ― sometimes to her detriment. She doesn’t necessarily always think things through before saying them. But I don’t do that very well either, so maybe that’s why I related to her. But yeah, she’s quite witty and quite intelligent and very human and driven by her gut and the way she feels about things, which is something that I really liked. Do we know how old she is or where she was born? I mean, she’s about early 20s, I would say. Yeah, that kind of age. Aaand I don’t know if I can say where she’s born. In the U.K.! To be vague. Well, obviously the entire “Doctor Who” universe is filled with a ton of secrecy and a lot of these really really dedicated fans. I saw that kids are already dressing up as your character online. What has your life as a companion been like so far ― even before the show has aired? It’s been kind of a whirlwind. It’s sort of like being welcomed into like the biggest, most enthusiastic family at a family gathering and being introduced to them all at the same time. And, you know, everyone’s got really strong opinions about what it is you’re about to do, which can be a little bit overwhelming at times. But I think, for me, it’s been amazing. It’s such a wonderful thing to be part of a show that means so much to so many people. You know, people relate to “Doctor Who” in such a personal way, which I think is why people have their own personal favorite Doctor, their favorite companion, their favorite monsters, their favorite episodes. It’s a very strong relationship for a lot of people. And it’s been wonderful to be to be welcomed so wholeheartedly into it. Did you do any particular research before you took on the role? Did you brush up on any of the history or any of the fan theories? You know, I didn’t watch much of “Doctor Who” when I was a kid. I didn’t watch any of the feature series ― I think I’ve watched one episode. But obviously you’d have to be living in some type of a hole to not be aware of the show. After getting the job, I said to Steven and [executive producer] Brian [Minchin], “Look, give me the back catalog and let me watch everything.” And they said, “Well, what you’re doing at the moment is great. You’re bringing a really nice sort of freshness to it. And, you know, you experiencing things as Bill is kind of experiencing things seemed to work really well. So don’t watch it!” And also, I kind of felt like as an actor watching someone play what is essentially your role [as a companion] and watching them do it so well, it would be hard not to borrow a little bit here and there, even subconsciously. And I really didn’t want to do that because I thought Bill was supposed to be completely fresh and completely new to this. So I thought it was best not to [watch].   Did Peter Capaldi or some of the other cast and crew members give you any memorable advice during your first moments on set? Peter was great. He gave me a little card and a scented candle for my new flat in Cardiff. It was really sweet. It’s such a big beast of a show, you know, in terms of its its reach and its fan base and all the extra little bits that make up the world of Doctor Who. But he said, “Remember why you’re here. You’re here because you’re really good.” Which was very kind of him to say. “The acting is what you’re here to do ― that’s the main job. We’re here to create this show and everything else is on top. But all of that can be a bit too much sometimes. It can seem like a lot, but if it does, here’s my number. Feel free to have a chat with me about it if anything seems too overwhelming.” Which was very lovely. The trailer for the upcoming “Who” season contains the line, “2017 needs us.” And Peter Capaldi has hinted in interview that while Season 9 began to reflect on the modern world a bit more, he thinks we might see more of that in Season 10. Does this mean we’re going to hear about contemporary politics at all on the show? Ummm, there might be some areas of contemporary politics in this series. Yes, indeed. But not in a very direct way. In a way that is open to interpretation, as all good art that imitates life is. If you know what I mean? Am I being too abstract? I can’t imagine keeping secrets, so I applaud you. On to the next question! One of my favorite “Doctor Who” fan theories claims that the Doctor always regenerates into a face he’s seen before. So, is there any chance the character of Bill is just one giant teaser for your eventual takeover as the Doctor? Would you turn down the role? What, would I turn down the role of Doctor Who? No, I’d be mad to do that, wouldn’t I? Can you imagine if someone was like, “Do you want to be Doctor Who?” And you were like, “Nah, I’m alright. One of the most exciting jobs in television? Nah, you can leave that, actually. I’m over it.” That’s not to say that’s what is going to happen. I mean, who knows?   There’s been loads of discussion about the all-male Doctor roster ― we’ve yet to see a woman tackle the role. What do you make of the show’s track record with representation?  I think in terms of representation, this series is doing pretty well from what I’ve seen so far. Hopefully, by the end of the series, we might have another conversation, or you might think the same. But in terms of playing the character of Doctor Who next, hopefully, they get whoever is best for the job, whatever gender or race that may be. You mentioned in a Guardian interview that you didn’t see many people who looked like you on TV growing up. When you think about your role on this show, are you thinking about the fans today who might still feel the same way you did? I think as an actress of color, there’s always that kind of responsibility. And especially in a prime-time, widely reaching show. For me, if even a couple of kids can look at Bill on “Doctor Who” and think, hey, she looks like me, maybe that means there’s more room for me in the world of acting or the world of television or the world of fighting aliens, then that’s a good thing, you know? I think it is important to see people that look like you and to show that there is a place for you in the world. That you do exist and that you are important. But then, that said, you know, I am only playing one person and she’s not supposed to be representative of every person and every young woman of color, because that would be a generalization that we wouldn’t want to make either. “Doctor Who” Season 10 premieres Saturday, April 15 at 9 p.m. ET on BBC America."
ARTS & CULTURE,Review: 'Teethmarks On My Tongue' By Eileen Battersby,"I had no idea what to expect from Teethmarks On My Tongue when I opened it, since it had been written by an American woman in Dublin, someone I’d met and liked, the chief book critic for The Irish Times. She’d given the thumbs up on all but one of my books, but I wasn’t sure what I’d think of hers. When her daughter, Nadia, was a child, the unmarried mother, Eileen Battersby, had no family in Ireland and she dragged the little child along. The management of the hotel had us sit in the stairwell of the Shelbourne. Battersby seemed wonderfully intense, extremely affectionate and intelligent, slightly mad. She lived in the country and could never leave her horses for long. Once she interviewed me in a little roadside hotel halfway between her farm and Dublin.  She was a very sensitive and curious critic, known for reviewing foreign titles in English translation, something most journalists were encouraged to avoid. She is open to every sort of literature of quality, even the most obscure. I sat over dinner last night with a French and a Malaysian novelist and they both had been reviewed brilliantly by Eileen Battersby, felt grateful to her but had never met her. My books are usually given to women to review; if a man takes one on, he’s either well-known to be gay or he starts his piece with “I, a heterosexual…” Just in case.  And isn’t the cliché that critics are disappointed novelists?  And first novels are supposed to be autobiographical, aren’t they? Happily, there was nothing disappointing or autobiographical about this book, save for an unusual affection for horses and dogs, but since I share those attachments, “Teethmarks” seemed utterly natural to me. It starts off with  high-octane intensity. Susan, a rather dizzy and eternally cheerful mother (one of Battersby’s best and most multi-dimensional characters) feels neglected by her veterinarian Southern husband and begins a dalliance with a younger man who, in a fit of jealousy, shoots her to death. The daughter (the narrator, Helen) was always too much the tomboy to get along with her self-dramatizing frilly mother (a Yankee with an exaggerated Scarlet O’Hara accent) but after the woman’s death the step-daughter volunteers to sing at the funeral. Helen, reflecting on Susan, her deceased mother, thinks, “Was she happy it was finally over and that at long last she wouldn’t have to try so hard to be happy?” (p41). There are moments in this Virginia sequence as brilliant as those in James Salter’s All That Is. Battersby is a subtle and convincing psychologist, not just for human beings but also for these one-ton gods in our midst: horses, and for those creatures that have evolved  in step with us: dogs. Her people are good, too. Here she traces the portrait of the cook in a French stately home: “She was a cheerful soul, motherly, careful not to step on the cats as she carried dishes out to the table; she referred to those squalling parasites as ‘mes enfants’ and never lost patience with the way, for all their stateliness, they’d grab at everything. The skin on her face made me think of wizened apples, lined and soft, flushed pink on sallow.” (p 259) Through a series of lucky accidents the narrator ends up in France  with a  stray dog, Hector, which she loves, and she is asked to work on a horse farm; in an oblique way Helen recreates a better version of her American adolescence with a kindly horse breeder, Monsieur Gallay, and another sketchy American beauty, nicknamed Lone Star, as vain and frivolous as Helen’s long-gone mother but a lot more hostile.  There’s also a handsome, eligible man… I admire Battersby’s comic sense, which never deserts her, her firm grasp of French social reflexes, customs and cuisine.  Her heroine has a drunken Parisian encounter with a totally sketchy man, but we’re intended to laugh at the American’s naiveté not the man’s beastliness.  This book is the sentimental education of an intelligent but unwary girl, who’s in love with astronomy and animals but doesn’t know much about the ordinary terrestrial life in between. She’s called Helen  Stockton Defoe , and like Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe she endures the strangest adventures while remaining fundamentally solitary. What do I know, but the horse world always struck me as oddly egalitarian; the ability to train and ride and care for the animals outweighs the social status of the equestrians.  (The heiress marries the stable boy, the lord of the manor dines with his trainer). Some of this egalitarianism rubs off on the observing Helen.  She sees the people around her with a true sense of their worth and, like a child, she is entirely indifferent to their worldly importance. For all her indifference to status, Helen is well-informed about the arts and especially her own fetishes, such as Caspar David Friedrich, the German Romantic painter of loneliness; Helen makes a special trip to Berlin to see his works. She is also taken with Van Gogh and with the Elizabethan poet Thomas Wyatt.  References to these artists are never  prestigious instances of cultural bric-a-brac but genuine dramatic turning points in the plot (the Wyatt poem, for instance, is cited during Susan’s funeral and it is not lost on the reader that Wyatt was accused of adultery with Anne Boleyn, just as Susan herself has died in a terrible adulterous mishmash). Culture—like the love of horses—is to be lived viscerally, seriously, morally."
ARTS & CULTURE,Margaret Atwood On ‘The Handmaid’s Tale’: 'I Made Nothing Up',"Weeks ahead of the forthcoming Hulu adaptation of The Handmaid’s Tale, a classic dystopian novel by Margaret Atwood, the author and the series’ star, Elisabeth Moss, discussed the story with Time.  The show, like the novel, follows a woman named Offred, who’s been enlisted as a “Handmaid,” or sex surrogate, for a couple with fertility issues. This setup is the norm in Gilead, a religious fundamentalist society that formed as a response to mass infertility.  And while the premise may seem extreme to some readers ― in fact, early reviewers of the novel dismissed it as implausible ― Atwood asserts that the world of The Handmaid’s Tale is nothing new.  “I made nothing up,” Atwood said in the Time interview, citing the Salem witch trials of the 17th century as an example of women’s oppression. “The control of women and babies has been a part of every repressive regime in history,” Atwood continued. “Not much has changed.” While the show was planned and shot before the 2016 presidential election, Atwood has taken its release as an opportunity to discuss today’s political issues, releasing a letter from PEN/America about the dangers of tyranny and speaking out on Twitter. And she doesn’t seem to plan on going anywhere soon: In a recent audiobook update, Atwood hinted at the possibility of a sequel. "
ARTS & CULTURE,Fancy Food Market Eataly Is Going To Help Save Leonardo Da Vinci's 'Last Supper',"Eataly, the fancy Italian market chain fronted by chef Mario Batali, is down to protect a good Italian meal in need. The famed eatery recently announced its plan to back an innovative air-filtration system meant to conserve Leonardo da Vinci’s iconic 15th-century painting “The Last Supper,” which depicts what is possibly the most epic Italian meal of all time. Da Vinci’s tempera-on-gesso masterpiece, depicting Jesus and his disciples deciding to sit on only one side of the dinner table, has been in a steady state of decline since its creation in 1498. The artist’s experimental construction method ― not to mention the fact that the work was once stored in a prison ― contribute to its rapid fading, which is aggravated by the “microscopic dust” of the visitors who make the pilgrimage to see it at Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan, Italy. As of now, restoration attempts have been largely unsuccessful, and only 1,300 visitors are allowed to see the work each day in order to limit the dust-induced damage.  According to an Eataly spokesperson, Italy’s Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities and Tourism has developed a system designed to protect this invaluable relic of Italian culture, and Eataly has graciously agreed to help foot the bill. Italian research institutes ISCR, CNR, the Polytechnic Institute of Milan and the University of Milano at Bicocca have teamed up to create a mechanism that will filter in around 10,000 cubic meters of clean air into the convent where the work is housed. That’s almost three times the current amount of sweet, un-dusty air coming in at present. The system aims to protect da Vinci’s work for the next 500 years, Eataly wrote in an email to The Huffington Post, meaning that all of your potential great-great-great-grandkids will get to see Judas, Peter and good ol’ Bartholomew in the flesh ― or, at least, in the paint. The installation is slated for completion by 2019, which also marks the 500th anniversary of da Vinci’s death.  If you’ve previously felt irked by Eataly’s high prices, know the profit from that $9 bag of pasta is going to a great place."
ARTS & CULTURE,Wall Street Bull Sculptor Says NYC Violated His Rights With 'Fearless Girl',"While critics were busy debating the merits of “Fearless Girl” ― that diminutive-but-defiant statue strategically placed in front of Wall Street’s resident “Charging Bull” ― the artist behind the old bovine was apparently asking, “What about me?” According to The Associated Press, Italian-American sculptor Arturo Di Modica is accusing New York City of violating his legal rights by permitting the installation of “Fearless Girl” in front of his bull, without his permission. Di Modica is expected to explain this accusation in a news conference on Wednesday, his attorney Norman Siegel claimed. The sculptor will be challenging the city officials who issued a permit for the bronze girl to stay until February of 2018, demanding that the city provide documentation behind the decision. A day before International Women’s Day, “Fearless Girl” first appeared on the Wall Street traffic island, meant to symbolize the lack of women on the boards of U.S. corporations. Designed by artist Kristen Visbal, the statue was celebrated by some as a model of female empowerment and criticized by others as a form of pinkwashing.  “Wall Street is a traditionally male environment and [the statue] says, ‘Hey, we’re here,’” Visbal told The Wall Street Journal. “To me, it says a woman can be delicate and petite, but strong.” “Don’t let emotions about this piece of art fool you,” HuffPost’s Emily Peck countered. “That adorable, perfectly irresistible little girl is just a super-sophisticated bit of feminist marketing, used to make us feel good and do little that is substantive.” Di Modica seems to agree, calling the statue an “advertising trick” created by corporations themselves ― Boston-based State Street Global Advisors and New York-based advertising firm McCann. Di Modica installed his 7,000-pound bronze bull in 1987, not long after the stock market crash of that same year, The Guardian writes. He did so in the middle of the night, without a permit. Authorities originally removed the work, but later reinstalled it after public outcry made clear that New Yorkers wanted the bull to stay. Visbal’s work was also installed in the middle of the night, though this time, with a permit. Similarly encouraged by fans, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced last month that “Fearless Girl,” initially scheduled to be removed on April 2, would remain where she is until 2018.  Displeased with that decision, Di Modica is fighting back. “We’re all for gender equality,” Siegel, the former director of the New York Civil Liberties Union who’s handling Di Modica’s case alongside attorney Steven Hyman, told The Washington Post on Tuesday night. “But the questions are because there are other issues.” “Men who don’t like women taking up space are exactly why we need the Fearless Girl,” de Blasio quipped on Facebook soon after. A lawsuit has not yet been filed, added Siegel, who has yet to provide further details. The time of Di Modica’s Wednesday press conference is unknown. This piece has been updated to include comments made by Mayor de Blasio on Facebook."
ARTS & CULTURE,7-Year-Old Refugee Who Tweeted During Aleppo Siege Is Writing A Memoir,"In 2016, 7-year-old Bana al-Abed gave the world a glimpse into the violent siege of Aleppo, Syria, on her Twitter account. She’s since been named “our era’s Anne Frank” and amassed over 300,000 followers, communicating the horrors of the Syrian civil war from a child’s perspective. My name is Bana, I'm 7 years old. I am talking to the world now live from East #Aleppo. This is my last moment to either live or die. - Bana Now, al-Abed will be writing a memoir detailing her life under siege, as well as her journey to overcome it, Entertainment Weekly reports. Dear World, published by Simon & Schuster, will be released in the fall of 2017. “I hope my book will make the world do something for the children and people of Syria and bring peace to children all over the world who are living in war,” al-Abed told EW in a statement.  Al-Abed and her family were able to flee Syria in December and are currently rebuilding their lives in Ankara, Turkey. The little girl is only slightly older than the six-year conflict in Syria and has suffered flashbacks of her traumas in Aleppo, according to CNN.  “I have dreams that I am still in Aleppo and there were more airstrikes,” al-Abed told CNN. “I was seeing how children are dying. I get sad and cry.” Hi @jk_rowling I watched Harry Potter movie, Bana would like to read the book.- Fatemah #Aleppo Fatemah, al-Abed’s mother, was an English teacher before the war and is responsible for managing her daughter’s Twitter account. After al-Abed watched one of the “Harry Potter” movies, her mother tweeted at J.K Rowling, informing her of the girl’s desire to read the series.  Rowling responded by sending the young author-to-be the “Harry Potter” eBook series. Al-Abed tweeted a thank-you video as well as pictures of herself reading the series on a cell phone to her younger brothers, Noor and Mohammed. “Harry Potter” can be interpreted as a story about war and division, in which Potter fights to end the influence of the violent Lord Voldemort. The series, and its lessons, have come to define an entire generation of readers, so it’s not surprising that al-Abed would find a connection with its characters.  But while Potter faced a fictional fight, al-Abed’s traumas are real ― and they aren’t going away anytime soon. She’s been called the face and voice of Aleppo, bringing humanity to destruction. “Recalling iconic young heroines such as Malala Yousafzai, Bana’s experiences and message transcend the headlines and pierce through the political noise and debates to remind us of the human cost of war and displacement,” Christine Pride, a senior editor for Simon & Schuster, told EW. "
ARTS & CULTURE,Sylvia Plath Alleged Abuse By Ted Hughes In Unpublished Letters,"The tumultuous marriage between Sylvia Plath and British poet Ted Hughes is the stuff of literary legend. Now evidence has surfaced suggesting that the union’s problems went far deeper than infidelity and heartbreak. According to The Guardian, unpublished letters Plath sent to her former therapist, Dr. Ruth Barnhouse, allege that Hughes beat her just days before she miscarried their second pregnancy. Another letter alleges that her husband told her that he wished she were dead. The letters, dated between February 1960 and February 1963, span the turbulent end of her marriage. In 1962, Plath discovered that Hughes had been carrying on an affair with Assia Wevill, a friend of theirs. The couple separated by the end of 1962, while Wevill and Hughes continued their romance more openly. On February 11, 1963, Plath died by suicide. Though the couple had been separated, Plath’s death left her husband in control of her literary legacy. He oversaw the publication of her poetry, including her famous and searing collection Ariel, much of which was written in the final years of her life. Scholars have been left to pick through her raw, impassioned verses for clues as to her psychological state, as more personal descriptions of her later years have been elusive. Hughes claimed her journals from the years immediately preceding her death had been lost, later telling The Paris Review that he did destroy “one journal that covered maybe two or three months, the last months. And it was just sad. I just didn’t want her children to see it, no. Particularly her last days.” Dr. Barnhouse also claimed, before her death, that she had destroyed her letters from Plath. Instead, says feminist scholar Harriet Rosenstein, Barnhouse gave them to her as material for a never-completed biography of the poet. Last month, Rosenstein put them up for sale, via bookseller Ken Lopez, as part of a large archive, priced at $875,000, assembled during her research for the nascent book. The letters to Dr. Barnhouse run to 45 pages, Lopez told The Telegraph, and contain “very dramatic and very personal” revelations. Though the exact content of the letters remain unpublished, several Plath scholars told The Guardian that they’re eager to unpack these long-lost personal writings. “These letters look as though they could fill certain gaps in our knowledge,” biographer Andrew Wilson said. Carol Hughes, the widow of Ted Hughes, stated to The Guardian that “The claims allegedly made by Sylvia Plath [...] are as absurd as they are shocking to anyone who knew Ted well.” Many Plath fans, however, have long held Hughes culpable in his wife’s emotional deterioration and eventual suicide. Hughes, who died in 1998, took pains to obscure or downplay his late wife’s more shocking journals and verses, telling The Paris Review that “[s]he thought of her journals as working notes for some ultimate novel” rather than faithful accounts of her life. The allegations contained in her letters to her former psychiatrist, which reportedly detail physical as well as emotional abuse, only stand to deepen the long-standing antagonism of feminist readers toward Hughes."
ARTS & CULTURE,Beyoncé's Pregnancy Photographer Is Turning His Attention To Trump's America,"Although most of America may not be familiar with the name Awol Erizku, they likely know his work. Specifically, they know the photograph of Beyoncé Erizku took in February 2017, which she then posted on Instagram to announce her pregnancy. The dreamy image of Bey covered in a gauzy mint veil, bulging belly exposed, turned iconic in a matter of minutes, quickly becoming the most liked Instagram photo of all time.  In his post-(Beyoncé’s)-baby glow, Erizku is turning his attention to a less glamorous but just as talked-about topic: the current state of American politics. The Los Angeles-based artist’s upcoming show ― titled “Make America Great Again” ― combines political symbology, urban iconography and ready-made objects with deep personal significance to conjure a potent appraisal of our uncertain times.  The presence looming over the politically-charged show is, of course, President Donald Trump, whose “Make America Great Again” baseball cap Erizku updates by adding the Black Panther Party logo atop it. Erizku has never shied away from being direct, even obvious, in his imagery, showing how art does not have to be esoteric to be effective. In another piece titled “How That Make You Feel?” the same panther image is printed on an American flag turned sideways. The image recalls Dred Scott’s “What is the Proper Way to Display a US Flag?” ― hinting at the extreme reaction it’s bound to elicit.  “I’m putting it out there because I’m black and I’m Muslim and this is everything Trump has tried to stand against,” Erizku, who was born in Ethiopia and raised in the Bronx, told The New York Times. “I don’t think this show is anti-American, but it is definitely anti-Trump. All the people he’s hating on do make America great.” Other works fold Erizku’s personal experience as a black man in America into an abstract, artistic language. For example, the piece “Wave Brake” features a slab of corrugated metal painted blue, the number “12” spray-painted over and over around it ― a slang term for the police. “It’s a little Cy Twombly-ish, but if you go to any kid on the street they will know what it means,” he told The New York Times. Next to it rests a yellow, plastic bucket and mop, alluding to the artist’s father, who worked as a janitor. Erizku, born in 1988, has been gaining momentum in the art world since before his brush with Beyoncé. His early works, made while a photography student at Yale, featured black subjects assuming the poses of art history’s iconic muses ― his sister, for example, was appointed a 21st-century “Girl with a Pearl Earring,” with golden heart hoops instead of the traditional pearl studs. The series highlighted the lack of black bodies represented in the art historical canon, yielding enchanting portraits with one foot in the past, the other in the present. While his current work veers away from photography into the realms of painting and sculpture, Erizku remains focused on issues that confront black youth in America, ensuring they are not overlooked by an art scene that is often insular, elitist and out of touch. We’re sure Beyoncé would be proud.  Awol Erizku’s “Make America Great Again” runs from April 20 until June 2 at Ben Brown Fine Arts in London. "
ARTS & CULTURE,'Handmaid's Tale' Waitlists Surge In Libraries Across America,"If you had casual plans to check out a copy of Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale from your local library, we have some bad news: The waitlists are almost as daunting as the author’s dystopian vision for the future. Hundreds of Handmaid’s Tale fans in New York City are waiting to get their hands on Atwood’s novel, soon to hit Hulu as an adapted TV series starring Elizabeth Moss, Samira Wiley, Joseph Fiennes and Alexis Bledel, according to a recent report from Patch verified by The Huffington Post. In February, readers placed 183 holds on 64 copies of the book at the New York Public Library alone. By March, the NYPL added 32 more copies of the book into circulation, and the number of holds jumped to 534. “As of today, there are currently 546 holds on 96 copies of The Handmaid’s Tale,” a NYPL representative told HuffPost on Monday. “For background, according to our online catalog, there aren’t other dystopian titles with the same level of checkouts or holds.” The NYPL isn’t the only public library experiencing a surge in demand for The Handmaid’s Tale, which recently rocketed to the top of Amazon’s best-seller list. According to the Chicago Public Library’s website, there seem to be four of 160 paperback copies of the book available to check out, though there are currently 63 holds on six other copies and 318 holds on 81 available ebooks. The San Francisco Public Library presents a similar backlog; there are 101 holds on 54 physical copies and 283 holds on 65 ebooks. The Houston Public Library boasts zero available physical copies. Demand for the book shouldn’t take anyone by surprise. Atwood’s 1985 novel is set in a near-future, totalitarian U.S. civilization called the Republic of Gilead, which is built on Christian fundamentalist values and fixated on the declining birthrate of its population. The story is told from the perspective of Offred, a “Handmaid” suddenly forced to abandon her relatively free life in order to have sex with, and produce children for, a high-ranking man whose wife is infertile. Offred is one of a number of Handmaids subjected to the reproductive rights nightmare that unfurls. A description of The Handmaid’s Tale on the Houston Public Library’s website characterizes it as “a novel of such power that the reader will be unable to forget its images and its forecast.” It continues: In condensed but eloquent prose, by turns cool-eyed, tender, despairing, passionate, and wry, she reveals to us the dark corners behind the establishment’s calm facade, as certain tendencies now in existence are carried to their logical conclusions. As many critics and fans ― and even Atwood herself ― have remarked, this story feels more relevant to American politics than ever. Just last month, a group of women activists made sure the parallel was clear by wearing Handmaid’s Tale–style red robes to the Texas Senate in protest of the anti-abortion bills being considered. (Ed. note: HuffPost reporter Catherine Pearson is attempting to keep up with the dizzying array of abortion-related bills in the U.S.) The NYPL did not speculate as to which factors have contributed to the book’s increase in popularity. Earlier in 2017, the waitlist for George Orwell’s 1984 surged, prompting the library to recommend a slew of other dystopian books, including the Atwood classic now sprinting off shelves. New York Times writer Alexandra Alter surmises that Americans turning to dystopia may be doing so as a response to the uneasy feelings some have felt after the election of President Donald Trump."
ARTS & CULTURE,Colson Whitehead's 'The Underground Railroad' Wins Pulitzer Prize,"Colson Whitehead’s National Book Award–winning speculative history novel The Underground Railroad garnered another top honor on Monday, with the announcement that the book had been awarded the Pulitzer Prize in Fiction for 2017. The novel reimagines the Underground Railroad as a real, tangible subway system carrying Southern slaves north. Whitehead’s fantastical twist on the nation’s history takes readers on a time-collapsed tour through the horrors visited upon black Americans from slavery onward, including medical exploitation and expulsion from certain territories. Upon its publication in August 2016, the book was well-received by critics, including HuffPost, which praised Whitehead’s “compelling, fluid blend of historical and speculative fiction.” Lynn Nottage received the prize in Drama for her Broadway debut, “Sweat.” The play follows a diverse chorus of nine working class people in a dying Pennsylvania factory town from 2000 to 2008. After the show’s opening, HuffPost wrote that the timely, emotionally searing play “provided Broadway with a much-needed elemental shake-up.” Also recognized in the arts were Tyehimba Jess, awarded the Pulitzer Prize in Poetry for his collection Olio, and Du Yun, awarded the Prize in Music for her eclectic opera about child trafficking, “Angel’s Bone.”  Blood in the Water: The Attica Prison Uprising of 1971 and Its Legacy by Heather Ann Thompson received the prize for History, and the Biography prize went to The Return: Fathers, Sons and the Land in Between by Hisham Matar. Matthew Desmond’s Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City added to its substantial list of awards with the Pulitzer Prize in General Nonfiction. The long history of the Pulitzer Prizes ― this year marked its 101st batch of awards ― has been critiqued for its overwhelmingly white and male honorees. The Pulitzers given out for the arts in 2017 featured five creators of color and three women out of the seven winners.  The journalism Pulitzers honored several local news teams, including the staff of the East Bay Times in Oakland, California, and Eric Eyre of the Charleston Gazette-Mail in West Virginia for their reporting on urgent local matters. Hilton Als, theater critic for The New Yorker, was awarded the Prize in Criticism for “bold and original reviews that strove to put stage dramas within a real-world cultural context, particularly the shifting landscape of gender, sexuality and race.” Check out the full list of Pulitzer winners for 2017 at the organization’s website."
ARTS & CULTURE,John Grisham Calls String Of Arkansas Executions A 'Spectacular Legal Train Wreck',"Best-selling author John Grisham on Monday issued a harsh rebuke of Arkansas’ plan to end a 12-year hiatus of the death penalty by executing seven men later this month.  Gov. Asa Hutchinson (R) should “stop the execution madness in Arkansas,” he wrote in USA Today.  The prisoners are slated for be killed two at a time between April 17 and April 27. Grisham, a former attorney and state lawmaker in Mississippi, called the plan “a spectacular legal train wreck.”  An eighth man, Jason McGehee, was also originally slated to be killed during that time period. However, a federal judge blocked that execution because it was scheduled to fall within the window of the state’s mandatory clemency review timeline.  “Indeed, no death-happy state has ever dreamed of eight kills in such a short time,” Grisham wrote.  There is so much urgency to the execution schedule because the state’s supply of midazolam ― a controversial sedative that’s been blamed for botched executions in at least four states ― expires this month, according to Hutchinson. It’s unclear if Arkansas will be able to get more of the drug once it does.   Grisham’s arguments mirror those of legal analysts and human rights activists who have brought up a variety of concerns about the procedure, including the strain it puts on corrections personnel and potential problems with the drugs.  Grisham mentions in his op-ed that two dozen former corrections officials and administrators recently sent a letter to Hutchinson, asking him to reconsider the hasty schedule on account of the “extraordinary and unnecessary stress and trauma” facing the corrections staff.  “Managing seven or eight rapid executions will be a brutalizing experience, even if there are no surprises,” Grisham said. He also blasted the state’s willingness to “arbitrarily violate its own policies and laws” regarding clemency in order to meet the frenzied schedule. Each of the men slated for execution will have one hour to make his case before the state clemency board, down from the typical two-hour allotment. They all also face a review process shorter than the 30 days that’s traditionally required.  “An execution is the most serious act a government can undertake,” Grisham said. “Why assume so many risks in the name of expediency? Even if Arkansas pulls it off, justice will lose.” Grisham, whose legal thrillers include The Firm and The Pelican Brief, is currently a board member of the Innocence Project, a nonprofit dedicated to using DNA evidence to exonerate wrongfully convicted people."
ARTS & CULTURE,'Hidden Figures' Author To Write Two New Books On Overlooked Black Icons,"Margot Lee Shetterly’s Hidden Figures (subtitled: The American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black Women Mathematicians Who Helped Win the Space Race) thoroughly debunked the idea that white men alone were responsible for winning the space race and, in the process, became a major hit. Both the original 2016 book and its lively film adaptation starring Taraji P. Henson, Janelle Monae and Octavia Spencer won over audiences ― and those readers and viewers will doubtless be psyched to learn that Shetterly is serving up more hidden history soon. Viking announced today that the publisher will be bringing out two new books from Shetterly which will examine “the idea of the American Dream and its legacy” by telling the stories of “extraordinary ordinary African-Americans whose contributions to American history have, for one reason or another, been untold, unseen, or overlooked.” Much like Shetterly’s last subjects, Dorothy Vaughan, Mary Jackson, Katherine Johnson and Christine Darden ― the black women whose computing power helped drive NASA’s dominance in space ― these figures made historic achievements before being set aside by history.  First, Shetterly will tackle Baltimore and the prominent black families that empowered its citizens in the middle of the 20th century, as well as the discriminatory policies and norms, such as redlining, that black Baltimore residents faced. The upcoming book will spotlight Willie Adams, a venture capitalist who invested in numerous black-owned businesses at a time when access to capital was hard for black Americans to come by. Upon his death in 2011, former Baltimore Mayor Thomas D’Alesandro told the Baltimore Sun, “He brought black entrepreneurs into the formerly all-white business community.” Adams’ wife, Victorine, was the first black woman on the Baltimore city council. In that same book, Shetterly will also examine the lives of the Murphys, a powerful family who published the Baltimore Afro-American newspaper for generations. And that’s all just in the first of a two-book deal ― we can’t wait to see what she has in store next. CORRECTION: A previous version of this article included the name Octavia Butler instead of Octavia Spencer. We regret the error."
ARTS & CULTURE,Alec Baldwin Calls Out Publisher For Errors In His New Memoir,"Alec Baldwin has been a busy gentleman in recent weeks. His impression of President Donald Trump on “Saturday Night Live” has been wildly popular (at least among liberals), he voiced the titular baby in the new breakout blockbuster “Boss Baby,” and his memoir Nevertheless hit bookstores last week. Nevertheless, he apparently found a free moment to take to Facebook with some concerns about the editing of his new book, The Guardian reports. In his first, and currently only, post on a Facebook page for Nevertheless, he noted that “the published edition contains SEVERAL typos and errors which I was more than a little surprised to see.” He also hinted that he was less than thrilled with how few photos made it into the book.  Baldwin didn’t sugarcoat his displeasure with the errors he saw in the final text. “The editors at Harper Collins were, I imagine, too busy to do a proper and forensic edit of the material,” he commented, rather cuttingly. Though the Facebook page is, he wrote, intended to be a platform for him to share material that didn’t make it into the book, his upcoming postings “will be an index of corrections and amendments to the text in order to bring it more in line with my original intent.” Perhaps Baldwin’s ongoing impersonation of Trump is wearing off on him ― the two men apparently share, at least, the impulse to bypass traditional media to set the record straight. All that said, only one correction ― more of a clarification than an amendment ― appeared in his initial post, published on April 4: When I write that I am “in love” with Megan Mulalley [sic] or Kate McKinnon or Tina Fey, I mean that I am in love with their talent. As a happily married man who wants to stay that way (ahem), I wanted to clarify that. Got it. HarperCollins declined to comment. But some fans and authors have weighed in with their thoughts on Facebook."
ARTS & CULTURE,'Star Wars' Fans Should Be Very Excited About This New Backstory Book,"On Thursday, a hashtag swept the “Star Wars” Twittersphere alerting fans that an announcement was on the horizon. That announcement, per the Del Rey Star Wars Twitter account, was to have something to do with a much-anticipated book code-named #OperationBlueMilk. On Friday, Del Ray spilled the denta beans, revealing that the book in question, Star Wars: From a Certain Point of View, is due out October 2017. The book involves more than 40 authors telling 40 stories that center around the background characters of “A New Hope.” (Think “X-wing pilots who helped Luke destroy the Death Star,” according to the Star Wars website, and “stormtroopers who never quite could find the droids they were looking for.” And most definitely everyone in the that cantina.) From a Certain Point of View will celebrate the 40th anniversary of “Star Wars: A New Hope,” which was released in 1977. But instead of honoring those staple characters ― you know, like Princess Leia and C3PO ― the book will pay tribute to those “really weird background characters” that help make the “Star Wars” universe so rich. So far, the public lineup of authors includes 28 men and women, some of whom have written “Star Wars”-related books and stories before, and others who’ve yet to dabble in the galaxy, but have demonstrated writing chops as mainstream authors elsewhere. Most notably, none of the authors will receive compensation for their work on the book, as their earnings are being donated to First Book, a nonprofit social enterprise that provides books and learning materials to children in need. Publisher Penguin Random House has also pledged $100,000 to the charity, while Disney/Lucasfilm reportedly donated approximately $1 million in books. From a Certain Point of View ― which you can preorder here, using this clandestine listing ― is not the first “Star Wars” book (you can check out several here), but it is the latest. And if we’re finally going to figure out what “Fiery” Figrin D’an is all about, we’re there for it."
ARTS & CULTURE,"To Make Women’s Stories Prestige TV, Just Add A Murder Plot","If you’d heard nothing about “Big Little Lies” beyond blurbs and snippets singing its praises, you might be aware that the HBO show (adapted from a book by Liane Moriarty) poignantly portrays the nuances of domestic abuse. You might know that it’s a smart meditation on school bullying, on the group-think of parenting communities, on relationships between adult women. You might know that it centers on first-world problems, but does so in a way that’s full of feeling.  What you might not know about “Big Little Lies,” unless you’ve seen it or read about it at length, is that the central event that weaves these stories together is a murder, and a police investigation into who committed it. After its satisfying conclusion, the whodunnit aspect of the show is seldom commented on; it’s the quieter, more personal storylines that seem to resonate.  A New York Times review of the recently wrapped-up drama argues that “the show’s empathy was its strength.” Another review on Vox praises the story, writing that its “most riveting moments are the silent ones between women.” HuffPost’s Emma Gray wrote that “at its core, ‘Big Little Lies’ is about the deep, complex and protective connections that can form between women in the face of buried trauma.” Members of the show’s cast seem to agree. In an interview with Vogue, Nicole Kidman spoke at length about her character’s domestic abuse, and the emotional difficulty of filming those scenes. When asked about the show’s appeal, Kidman complemented the author’s ability to write moving, fully realized characters. “She writes these novels and then she threads in these deeply painful and topical and real emotions and relationships that you get pulled into,” Kidman said.  Again, in an interview with Vulture, Kidman described the complexity of her relationship with Alexander Skarsgård’s character, his “dominance” and “fragility.” While the conversations around the show ― by viewers and critics and the actors themselves ― have been remarkably nuanced and functioned as jumping-off points for broader conversations about abuse and the stereotype of female pettiness, these themes rarely appear on so-called prestige television. It’s the other, more superficially central aspects of “Big Little Lies” ― the murder, the suspense, the sun-lapped gun in the opening sequence ― that align it with other widely praised shows. And, while those elements of the story are arguably the least interesting, it seems unlikely that the show would’ve been embraced without them. It’s not accurate to say all prestige TV is the same; you wouldn’t recommend “Westworld” to a “Transparent” fan. But there are tenants to the genre that reappear more than others. In a recent list poking fun at the concept of prestige TV, Vulture lists out the signs you know you’re watching a highly regarded show, including “Darkness,” “What the hell is even happening right now?” “Breasts,” and “The sad man.” A mash-up of these qualities appear in “Game of Thrones,” “True Detective,” “Better Call Saul,” “House of Cards,” and the original prestige show, “The Sopranos.” So, if a production company were to take a gamble on a show that could be an awards season contender, a brooding and violent male protagonist would be a safe bet. But recently, a woman-centered riff on that storyline ― a vengeful woman with a plan, and a gun ― has emerged. In the last year, two films about women seeking revenge for sexual violence or emotional manipulation committed against them ― “Elle” and “The Girl on the Train” ― predicted audiences’ interest in “Big Little Lies.”  There is, it seems, an interest in stories about sexual abuse. But, perhaps due to the proven success of more clamorous approaches to storytelling, these stories are being stuffed into the revenge genre arc, the character’s abuse a jumping-off point for outward action. In “Elle” and “The Girl on the Train,” abuse itself isn’t the dramatic focal point ― the identity of the abuser is. But, as with “Big Little Lies,” critics seem less impressed with the deftly written mystery plot than they are with the portrayals of issues such as gaslighting.  Because it’s a miniseries, and afforded more space than a movie, “Big Little Lies” manages to achieve both things ― to comment on abuse as it unfolds, and to satisfy the apparent commercial need for a noir-like overtone. That audiences and critics both found Celeste’s personal struggles more resonant than Jane’s thoughts of revenge bodes well for the future of these stories; perhaps now production companies will be more likely to take a risk on complex depictions of abuse, rather than coming at the issue slantwise. Imagine, for a moment, the plot of “Big Little Lies” sans murder. A woman, overcome with listless feelings, cheats on her caring second husband; another struggles to parse out her feelings for her husband from his abusive actions; another moves to a new town, and, due in part to class differences, struggles to defend her son against bullying accusations; another feels spurned for balancing work with parenting, and behaves defensively as a result; another is trying to gingerly encourage her stepdaughter’s activism, while remaining cordial with her husband’s overbearing ex. There are ample opportunities for tension, for high stakes, for the things that make stories interesting. But, in the past, this type of story ― one centered on the earnest dramas and ennui of parenthood and domesticity ― has been written off as “Hallmark”-worthy, as unimportant.  Maybe we needed to simultaneously experience both ― a gun-slinging mystery and an all-too-real commentary on the dramas women experience daily ― to appreciate the value of the latter.  Fortunately, HBO ― the gatekeeper of must-watch smart shows ― seems to have recognized the salience of these stories. The network recently announced that it will adapt Elena Ferrante’s Neapolitan novels, which, like “Big Little Lies,” focuses more on its friendships, and its domestic tragedies, than on the violence that surrounds them.

ARTS & CULTURE,11 Republican Lawmakers Sign Letter In Support Of Arts Funding,"In a move demonstrating the uphill battle President Donald Trump will face attempting to achieve his budgetary goals, 11 House Republicans have signed a letter expressing support for the National Endowment for the Arts. The New York Times reported on Friday that the signatories included “one Republican who previously voted to defund public broadcasting,” though none of the lawmakers were named. The letter was sent to Rep. Ken Calvert (R-Calif.) and Rep. Betty McCollum (DFL-Minn.) ― the Republican chairman and top-ranking Democrat, respectively, of the House subcommittee with jurisdiction over appropriation of funds for the NEA and National Endowment for the Humanities. Eliminating the NEA and NEH has long been a conservative pet project, but it’s also a tricky one to accomplish, even when the Republican Party controls both legislative bodies. The endowments may be favorite targets of small-government, budget-cutting hardliners, but they’ve nonetheless enjoyed support from a healthy number of Republican lawmakers over the years.  Several GOP lawmakers expressed their support for the endowments after Trump’s bold proposal that they be eliminated entirely. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) issued a statement in March that read, in part: “I believe we can find a way to commit to fiscal responsibility while continuing to support the important benefits that N.E.A. and N.E.H. provide.” Rep. Mark Amodei (R-Nev.) commented, “I support the present level of funding for these programs.” Arts advocacy groups likely aren’t surprised ― in fact, they’ve been counting on some level of Republican support for the arts and humanities endowments to see them through this existential threat. In March, PEN America executive director Suzanne Nossel and Stephen Kidd, executive director of the National Humanities Alliance, each cited a February letter sent by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) to the president advocating for continued support of the endowments. The letter was signed by 23 other senators, including two Republicans, while others, like Murkowski and Amodei, issued separate statements endorsing the endowments. “We are heartened by the level of bipartisan support that members of Congress have shown for the NEH in recent years and in recent weeks,” Kidd told HuffPost. After the embarrassing withdrawal of the Trump-backed legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act last month, which foundered due to a lack of Republican support, it’s clear that even with his party controlling both the House and the Senate, Trump may struggle to achieve much of his agenda.  Signs from G.O.P. legislators continue to suggest that shuttering the NEA and NEH will remain an unlikely victory."
ARTS & CULTURE,Margaret Atwood Offers New Insights On Tyranny In Updated 'Handmaid’s Tale' Audiobook,"Later this month, Margaret Atwood’s classic novel The Handmaid’s Tale ― which has become a staple of high school curriculums ― will be released as a TV adaptation starring Elisabeth Moss and Alexis Bledel. Like the book, the show promises to shed light on how power structures can work to oppress women, and the powerful rhetoric of religious fundamentalism.  These ideas are navigated by Offred, the story’s heroine, who must work as a surrogate to a couple struggling with fertility. In Atwood’s original story, we learn by the end that the story’s narration is actually a found recording, made by Offred and later studied later by an archivist at Cambridge named Professor Pieixoto.  It’s Pieixoto who delivers the book’s last lines, which sum up the heroine’s tragic story with an intentionally glib sort of distance. “Are there any questions?” he asks.  Today, The Washington Post reports that a new audiobook version of the story goes beyond Pieixoto’s conclusion, recording the fictional audience’s questions about the likelihood of tyranny recurring in their own society.  This scene was written by Atwood, who’s been vocal about her story’s relevance to today’s political climate. In a letter distributed by PEN/America, she warned readers against “dictators of any kind.”  Soon, that message will be trumpeted to an even broader audience, as the story makes its way to the screen. Check out a sample of the Audible update below:"
ARTS & CULTURE,A Museum In Germany Is Asking Designers To Give Peace A New Sign,"A museum in Frankfurt wants to give peace a sign. A new sign, that is. The Schirn Kunsthalle museum recently issued an open call inviting designers both professional and amateur to submit new graphic images that communicate the contemporary notion of peace. “We feel it is high time for a new peace logo,” Philipp Demandt, the director of the Schirn Kunsthalle museum, wrote in the invitation. “A logo for today that reflects our current notion of peace.” The hunt for the next peace sign comes in conjunction with the exhibition “PEACE,” on view at the museum this summer. The current reigning peace sign symbol was created in 1958 for the first Aldermaston march, a massive demonstration advocating for nuclear disarmament. Among the hordes of protesters who marched over 50 miles from Trafalgar Square in London to the site of the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment was Gerald Holtom, a designer and art school grad. Many, many protesters raised original, politically-charged imagery above their heads as they marched, but Holtom’s image was the one that stuck ― it was adopted by the Direct Action Committee against nuclear war. While Holtom’s peace sign ― created without copyright ― might look radically simple upon first glance, there is some purportedly heavy symbolism lurking within the circle inscribed with three intersecting lines. First, the symbol allegedly references the semaphore signals for the letters “N” and “D,” alluding to nuclear disarmament. (Semaphore is a telegraphy system meant to convey information at a distance using visual signals like flags; “N” looks like this and “D” looks like this.) But yet another inspiration behind the peace sign reportedly comes from the annals of art history, specifically the 1814 painting “The Third of May 1808” by Francisco de Goya. The image depicts a Spanish man standing before a firing squad of Napoleon’s army, arms spread in surrender, a Christlike image rooted in Spanish history. The revolutionary painting captured the horrors of war in a single, emotionally riveting image.  In a letter to Hugh Brock, the editor of Peace News, Holtom explained his motivation for the sign. “I was in despair. Deep despair,” he wrote. “I drew myself: the representative of an individual in despair, with hands palm outstretched outwards and downwards in the manner of Goya’s peasant before the firing squad. I formalized the drawing into a line and put a circle round it. It was ridiculous at first and such a puny thing.” Holtom’s symbol caught on nearly immediately, its exterior simplicity evoking authentic feelings of despair and political urgency. Today, however, the Schirn Kunsthalle believes it is time for the next iteration of peace imagery, one that more aptly communicates what peace means at this particular moment in human history. While Holtom’s image was made in response to the looming threat of nuclear violence, there are a barrage of new issues threatening safety and harmony among humans today.  Participants are invited to submit their peace logos for review until May 8. The winner will receive €1,000 and his or her logo will be used in advertising efforts accompanying the “PEACE” exhibition. You can also vote for one of the top 10 logos online in May to help determine the Audience Prize. "
ARTS & CULTURE,"Naomi Klein Is Writing An Anti-Trump Manifesto Very, Very Quickly","Prominent author and social activist Naomi Klein will publish an anti-Trump book this summer, her publisher announced on Wednesday. The book, entitled No Is Not Enough: Resisting Trump’s Shock Politics and Winning the World We Need, will lay out a blueprint for countering the anticipated harmful effects of President Donald Trump’s presidency on the environment, the economy, people of color and more. Trump’s election threw a nation of liberals and moderates into turmoil, and his opposition has responded in various ways: marches, protests, boycotts, petitions and, of course, reading voraciously.  Even aside from the heightened demand for existing books on totalitarianism and dystopia, the election seems to have created a new market for left-leaning manifestos. Yale historian Timothy Snyder’s On Tyranny, a handbook for protecting our democracy, came out in March. An essay collection entitled What We Do Now: Standing Up for Your Values in Trump’s America, came out before the 45th president had been inaugurated. Even Alec Baldwin has an upcoming book responding to the Trump presidency. Klein, like Snyder, is at least well-positioned to write such a work quickly and well. The Canadian writer’s 1999 book No Logo ably dissected the ramifications of companies relying on brand promotion and of consumer culture, and won her a huge audience; she’s continued her political and economic criticism in books such as The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism.  No Is Not Enough will unpack the forces that led to Trumpism ― such as corporatism and nationalism ― and offer a broad-based plan to combat it. Klein will apparently argue that Trump is not a fluke or a sudden surprise: “On the contrary, he is the logical conclusion to many of the most dangerous trends of the past half century,” she writes. “He is the personification of the merger of humans and corporations — a one-man megabrand, with wife and children as spin-off brands.” Those who are eager to hear more of Klein’s anti-Trump analysis won’t have to wait long ― though she started writing it just two months ago, the book is being rushed to print. Haymarket Books, which will bring the book out in the U.S., announced in a press release that it’s slated for June 13. "
ARTS & CULTURE,Artist Proposes A New Way Of Seeing Nude Women At The Museum,"Warning: This article contains nude imagery that may not be appropriate for work environments.  When you see a woman’s naked body, what assumptions come to mind? Do you see a muse, a victim, a sexual object? This question was on Phoebe Boswell’s mind when she began her multimedia series “For Every Real Word Spoken,” now on view in London. From a distance, the installation resembles a lineup of straightforward, naturalistic pencil drawings of unclothed women, not entirely distinct from the nude images that have adorned gallery and museum walls for centuries. Look closer, however, and you’ll notice that each subject holds a cell phone against her chest, the screen facing outward.  Drawn into each screen is a handmade QR code, which visitors are encouraged to scan with their cell phones, triggering a song, article, image or observation chosen by the real woman featured in the portrait. Scan the drawing above, for example, and Brenda Fassie’s “Good Black Woman” rings out, as if materializing from the heart of the naked figure. The drawings, with their technological details, challenge the idea of the passive female nude. “They’re interactive drawings,” Boswell explained to BBC Africa. “They don’t just exist to please you. They exist to honor themselves.”  In an interview with The Huffington Post, Boswell, who was born in Kenya and raised in the Middle East, expanded upon the motivation for the series. “I wanted to subvert what we have been conditioned to think of when we see the female body naked,” she said. “What we have been taught it means, why we are so cautious about protecting it, why it has this edge of vulnerability the male body doesn’t have.” In part, Boswell was inspired to pursue this topic after coming across a photograph of Ugandan women lying naked on a dirt road. When she first saw it, the image immediately filled her with visceral dread; without thinking, she surmised the women depicted had been the victims of violence.  She later learned that, far from being in danger, the photographic subjects had de-robed as an act of protest. “I thought they were victims and that was turned on its head,” Boswell said, disarmed by how deeply entrenched assumptions regarding women and their bodies are, even in the minds of self-professed feminists.  Through her work, Boswell aims to rupture the associations between female nudity and passivity, weakness and empty allure. “I wanted to celebrate the power of the female body,” she said. “Women are not just sexual objects or victims; we have the power to speak.” For this series, Boswell took inspiration from conceptual artist Adrian Piper’s 1971 series “Food for the Spirit,” in which the artist photographed herself over the course of a month, both with clothes and without, as a ritual of self-love. “She seemed so in control of herself,” Boswell said, describing Piper’s photos as early selfies. “She was insisting, ‘This is how I want you to see me,’ taking complete control over this depiction of herself.” Boswell reached out to potential “For Every Real Word Spoken” subjects on Facebook, inviting women to join her “army” and explore the ways bodies could be used as protest. Her subjects ― a range of writers, artists and activists in her community ― imitate Piper’s blunt and forward pose, staring at the viewer head-on.  In lieu of a camera, however, Boswell’s subjects wield cell phones, the vessels that provide women easy means to portray and disseminate their images, tastes, accomplishments and opinions on their own terms. Incorporating modern tech into the art-viewing experience, Boswell thought, would perfectly summon the proper tension between the image and the person, the digital and the real. “The way we depict ourselves is very much through this space of the digital,” Boswell said. “We have these theoretical, curated versions of ourselves we portray online. And we have our real, vulnerable, fleshy selves that have flaws and suffer. Putting together the very fragile medium of drawing with this digital technology allows the subject to speak directly to the viewer without my input.” Boswell is known for igniting traditional draftsmanship ― or draftswomanship as she calls it ― with the help of virtual technologies like animation, sound and digital manipulation. “I try and layer languages to tell stories,” Boswell said. “I think our identities are so complicated it’s possible to tell our stories in one singular, semantic language. I always use technology in my practice, and am constantly navigating how to do that in ways that honor the draftsmanship, that don’t take over but complement it.” For her exhibition title, Boswell lifted a quote from feminist writer Audre Lorde, which reads: “For every real word spoken, for every attempt I had ever made to speak those truths for which I am still seeking, I had made contact with other women while we examined the words to fit a world in which we all believed, bridging our differences.”  The artist hopes her imagery, like Lorde’s writings, inspire women “to resist the limitations placed on us in society and to speak.” Phoebe Boswell’s “For Every Real Word Spoken” runs until April 22 at Tiwani Contemporary in London. "
ARTS & CULTURE,'Sweat' Playwright Plans 'Companion Piece' To Groundbreaking Broadway Play,"Lynn Nottage’s play “Sweat” has been heralded as the “The First Theatrical Landmark of the Trump Era.” It tells the story of a tight group of working-class people in Reading, Pennsylvania, who ― in the face of layoffs, impending poverty, and the threat of incarceration and drug abuse ― come to terms with their collapsing reality. While the characters relay their experiences in a setting that takes place years before President Donald Trump took office, the play slyly answers a question on the minds of many American voters: How did we get here? (Here, of course, being the “Trump era” of note.) In an interview with The Huffington Post, Nottage announced that she is currently working on a companion piece to her groundbreaking production. “I have another play that’s in conversation with ‘Sweat,’” Nottage explained, when asked about her plans now that “Sweat” is running smoothly after its Broadway debut earlier this month.  According to Playbill, the new play is currently titled “Floyd” and will be a comedy. (”Sweat” is a drama, though it has moments of comedic relief.) Nottage did not provide any further details regarding her companion piece, but she did supply us with a few more future credits to her name. “I have some other projects,” she told HuffPost. “I’m doing an adaptation of ‘Black Orpheus,’ the movie, for the stage with director George Wolf; an adaption of ‘The Secret Life of Bees’ with Duncan Sheik and Susan Birkenhead; and I’ve recently finished an adaptation of my play ‘Intimate Apparel’ as an opera with composer Ricky Ian Gordon.” When pressed on the upcoming companion piece, and how the experience of making “Sweat” influenced Nottage’s practice, she added: It’s made me think much more expansively about why and how I make art and where I want to make it. And the impact that it can have. I don’t have all the answers to those questions, but certainly, being in Reading has challenged me to think about what it is I want to do and why I do it. Nottage’s play, set in 2000 and 2008, has been widely celebrated as an illuminating piece of contemporary art. “The immediacy of it is almost freakish,” MSNBC anchor Chris Hayes told Variety. “I’m not sure how [Nottage] managed it. Not only is it great as drama, in that it’s incredibly well-crafted with well-drawn characters, but it’s also one of the most sophisticated political texts I’ve encountered in a long while.” Read more about “Sweat” here."
ARTS & CULTURE,A Play About A Small Pennsylvania City Is What Art Should Look Like In Trump's America,"Since Lynn Nottage’s play “Sweat” opened at New York City’s Studio 54 earlier this month ― marking the Brooklyn-born playwright’s Broadway debut ― the theater world has felt a little different.  The play is small in setting and large in scope. Pivoting in time from 2000 to 2008, the story follows a tight group of working-class people ― spanning generations; black, white, Latino ― who feel tethered to a dying city plundered by factory layoffs. The particular town is Reading, Pennsylvania, but that fact feels necessary one moment and utterly irrelevant the next. Nottage’s Reading is eerily reflective, it seems, of many small American cities facing layoffs and accompanying pangs of uncertainty, rage and despair. While her modest cast of nine carefully-crafted, fictional characters is based on several years worth of in-person interviews and research, their stories flood together into a narrative that bleeds beyond one family, one factory or one fractured hometown.  “What I saw ― and what was the initial impulse for going to Reading ― was that there was a large swath of people across the country who were in a great deal of pain,” Nottage explained in a phone interview with The Huffington Post, days after her play’s opening night. “And that story was not being told. And I think that, unfortunately, the fact that we are where we are is because there are people who were shouting and who felt unheard, and as a result, they made some extreme decisions that have impacted and jeopardized all of us.” Dubbed “The First Theatrical Landmark of the Trump Era,” Nottage’s attempt to answer that itchy question plaguing a country divided ― How did we get here? ― has provided Broadway with a much-needed elemental shake-up. It’s not to say theater hasn’t attempted to tell stories fundamental to the politics of our time before, or reflect on the lives of people outside of its capitol, New York City. But Nottage’s approach, likened to a journalistic method in which she spent years alongside director Kate Whoriskey getting to know the people of Reading, has tested the role of art in politics. Her desire to push popular conversations forward, her desire to not only mirror but engage with culture right now, has offered a contemporary model for connecting with audiences outside of Broadway’s institutions. ”Sweat” is ecstatic and devastating, peppered with sweet humor that can easily descend into knee-buckling hate. It revolves around a watering hole, where factory workers past and present discuss the realities of their vanishing lives. These conversations happen in two loosely defined points in time: in the year before Sept. 11, 2001 and moments before the global financial crisis of 2008. Throughout, the characters profess honest and sometimes hard-to-hear opinions about race and entitlement, and they deal, sometimes violently, with the effects of incarceration, immigration and the opioid crisis. Reading’s experiences, unfiltered on Nottage’s stage, roll out in fragments, leaving the audience to piece together an answer to that lingering question: How did we get here? If there is an answer, it’s stuck in a heap of emotions, tangled in a mass of perspectives. If we can’t look back, Nottage seems to imply, can we look forward? For her, after countless hours spent speaking with the people of a small Pennsylvania city, the answer is yes. “In order for us to move forward, we as a community must take care of each other,” she explained to HuffPost. “When we become fractured, and we retreat into our individual silos, we create these cultural collisions that destroy culture as a whole. [...] In order for us to move forward, we have to figure out a way for all these disparate voices to stand in one place and find common ground.” Read more of our conversation with the “Sweat” playwright below: You’ve mentioned in interviews that this play was inspired by your own friends who’ve suddenly found themselves close to poverty. How exactly did you decide upon Reading as the setting for “Sweat”? I was really wanting to sort of understand with more depth the nature of what was happening in this country on a large scale to folks who were living in these mid-sized deindustrial cities. Reading, Pennsylvania, seemed like an ideal city in that it had once been quite a robust manufacturing town, with its base being textiles and pretzel and candy factories and baking factories and steel factories. It was a place that, for years, if you got off a bus, within an hour you could have a job. Within the course of maybe 30 years, those jobs began to disappear to the point where it had a staggering unemployment rate and was deemed the poorest city of its size in America. So that is why that city in particular ― that’s what drew me there. The preparation for the play began when ― if what I’ve read is correct ― Oregon Shakespeare commissioned a play from you about American revolutions. Right, yes. Oregon Shakespeare gave me a commission to write a play specifically about an American revolution. They invited playwrights to really think expansively. They wanted large-scale plays that investigated key moments in American history. I became very interested in the moment at the turn of the 21st century, which was the deindustrial revolution, and how that was really going to reshape our cultural narrative in ways that hadn’t been done since the mid-century with the civil rights movement. What was your first day in Reading like? Well, it’s interesting to enter a place that you don’t know at all. When we drove into the city, we were sort of surprised to see a lot of physical beauty ― homes that are colonial in many respects, mid-century; homes that are ornate and quite lovely. So that was the first thing we encountered. And we were like, perhaps we’re in the wrong city! This can’t possibly be the Reading that we’ve read about.  What we discovered is that a lot of those houses have been segmented and house multiple families inside of them. So that was our first impression of Reading: as a place of physical beauty, but underneath, was a city that was struggling and crumbling. And then when you get inside of the city, you find these people with these really rich histories, who in some instances felt trapped by circumstance, because they couldn’t find jobs in the city and because [...] they didn’t have the economic means to leave. So they have this strange investment in seeing the city resurrected, but they are not able to do that.  But the fascinating thing about Reading is that it’s an over 50 percent Latino city, so you definitely feel the flavor of the Puerto Rican and Dominican and much, much smaller Mexican populations. How many people did you speak to in Reading throughout the course of your research for the play? Oh, I can’t even [count] ― many, many, many, many, many people. It was over the course of a number of years, so some people we spoke to over great lengths and multiple times over the course of years. A lot of people who we interviewed once, we did very short, five- to 10-minute interviews. There were people [with whom] we did half-hour interviews. And then there were people who we got to know, and over the years, we didn’t just do interviews, we had many conversations. We were able to peel away the layers and figure out what their personal struggles or triumphs were. Were there any initial obstacles to bringing the story to the stage? I didn’t feel as though there were many obstacles in the writing of the story. The obstacle was before writing it and sort of deciding what to write about. Having so many things to look at and trying to distill how to tell a story that’s mentally complicated and isn’t just representative of Reading, but of what I felt was happening as a whole. And how the play can serve as a metaphor of deindustrialization without being overly heavy-handed. But also, I’m one of these playwrights ― I’m not afraid of the words “political theater.” I resent the fact that in this day and age, [playwrights] are supposed to be invisible in the storytelling. I thought, it’s very rare in any other form that you’re asked to disappear. I think that now is the time, particularly as artists, that we have to take the initiative and really engage with the culture and say things that people really do not want to hear, in order to push the dial forward. So if you talk about an obstacle, it was just understanding that there would be some resistance to a play in which the playwright carried a hammer. After conducting your research, did you feel as though you needed to weave together separate perspectives into a cohesive narrative, or did you immediately find that all these realities ― related to labor, race, immigration, incarceration, the opioid crisis ― had a central point of origin? I found that the city ― everything ― is integrated. People say, “Oh, the play is about a lot of things.” But you know, the fact is, you can’t tell one story without telling the other. It is a city where you have a workforce that’s been diminished, and as a result, a lot of people have turned to substance abuse, and you have these collisions that happen, when people become really panicked and begin to turn on each other and place blame across the racial divide. So I found that all these stories were so intertwined, you couldn’t tell one without the other. As an audience member, you watch these characters, and, even as you’re developing this incredible well of empathy, it’s almost impossible not to pass judgment on some of their beliefs ― particularly when Tracey expresses xenophobic ideals or Jason discounts Affirmative Action. It’s hard not to see them, in those rare moments, as either good or bad. How did you handle the idea of morality throughout writing and developing this play? You know, when I was sitting down to write the play, I knew that I was writing about people who all had individual flaws, which I think is true of most of us. In these particular circumstances, everyone is trying to survive and, as a result, make incredibly difficult and compromised choices ― compromised choices that are detrimental to the entire community ― in order to protect the individual. The phrase, and I’ve said this to the media, that I used when I was talking to people is “replace judgment with curiosity.” I was trying to understand who these people are fundamentally, rather than entering with resistance, because I think that if I entered Reading with resistance, the people I sat down with would not have told me their stories, and I would have not been able to find a way to build empathy. Following the 2016 election, conversations in the media started revolving around the Rust Belt working class and these people who may or may not have voted for the current president because they felt “left behind” by the past administration. They felt invisible. But you wrote this play before the election. What has it felt like to create a piece of theater that seems so perfectly centered in culture right now? It’s interesting. You know Werner Herzog, the filmmaker? He said something that I’ve sort of embraced. He said the role of the artist is to keep their eyes open when everyone else’s are shut. And I do think it’s our responsibility to begin asking those difficult questions perhaps earlier than the culture at large. I think that when art and culture collide in moments like this it’s because of a certain necessity. That’s what I felt. I began asking those questions because those questions were not being asked by the culture at large. And the play happened to collide with culture at just the right moment. I do think that’s part of our responsibility as artists. How have the people of Reading reacted to the play? Have they seen it? Have you been in contact with the town? At the end of our run at the Public Theater, [before the play went to Broadway], one of the things that we decided to do was to embrace the mission of the Public, which is really to take the play to the people. To take it out of that proscenium setting, out of the institution, and we took the play to Reading. The entire cast. We did a very stripped-down version of it for a hundred folks in Reading, Pennsylvania, in their Miller theater. It was kind of an electric evening because the actors were very scared about portraying people in the town that absolutely were very familiar with a lot of the cultural references in the play. But at the very end, there were a ton of questions and people seemed to be quite moved. And it almost became like a revival meeting, in which people stood up and testified and told their personal stories about what they’re going through. It was very, very moving. But, by the same token, there have been a couple of people, and they tended by and large to be business people, who worried about ... will this be bad for business in Reading? I think that any time you open up a dialogue around a particular city, it has to be good for the city. Was anyone outright angry about the play? I don’t know that anyone … certainly, when we did the performance [in Reading], no one was angry about the play. I think there’s only been one person I’ve encountered who was angry about the play, from Reading, because it was bad for business. Be damned the people who are struggling, it’s bad for business. Did you feel indebted to these people in any way? Did adapting their stories create another layer of responsibility for you as a playwright? I think it’s not adapting the stories that creates a different layer of responsibility. Sort of getting to know them and forging friendships certainly did. Spending so much time with people you care about and wanting to see a space that’s struggling thrive. I think that’s where I feel my responsibility lies ― with those friendships. What was it like to work on this play over the course of a few years? What were some of the benefits of taking your time to tell this story? I think the benefits of doing it over the course of years is that you can track the movement of people. My assumption, when we first went into Reading, was that we were going to be very typically looking for pockets of resilience ― people who were struggling and found ways to resurrect their lives. Because as a writer, I’m always attracted to the light. I’m never attracted to the darkness or the ugly stories. I’m really looking for people who’ve struggled and really pulled themselves out of their circumstances. Just over the course of two years, you can track and see where people are going, how they are navigating difficult times. That was the benefit, of getting to track people over time and getting a sense of the movement of the city as a whole. And how it was reacting to this article about it being the poorest of cities, how it went into emergency mode and tried to resurrect itself. And where it is today. There are these amazing things that are happening now. In the center of town, there’s a DoubleTree Hotel, in which the manager has committed to hiring 70 percent people within walking distance of the hotel. He’s someone who gives people second chances, too. If you’ve checked that box that says you’ve gone to prison or you’ve been through rehab, he’s not going to automatically reject your application. When you go into that hotel, you feel the vibrancy and the vitality. It’s a perfect case of the community taking care of itself. When it does that, it succeeds. Personally, do you have hope for towns like Reading or other cities similarly situated across the U.S.? I do think that if cities like Reading ― you take the example of the DoubleTree, when cities begin to invest in everybody in the town ― those cities have a good chance of survival. I know that there are a lot of cities saying, you know, let’s let these inner-city neighborhoods die and let’s bring people back from the suburbs. And that’s tough. That’s when you create “ghettos,” in which people become trapped and have no opportunity to leave. But I think that when you say, you know, we’re invested in everyone here, and [ask], ‘How can we build businesses that are inclusive? Businesses that really create opportunity? How can we be creative in the new businesses?’ What Reading realizes is that a lot of those manufacturing jobs aren’t going to come back. So they have to create other ways to employ folks, and I think the more creative cities can be, the better chance they have of resurrecting themselves. In the great New Yorker profile that came out last month, you are quoted as saying “the goal is to create a whole generation of resistance,” in reference to arts institutions closing in and demanding that playwrights shape their visions to the space. Broadly speaking, what is your hope for the future of theater? A perfect example is a time like this, in places like Reading. What they really need, I feel, are storytellers. They need art, they need celebration. But they don’t have those institutions, because all the cultural institutions are in New York and Philadelphia and Chicago. I think that we as artists need to figure out strategies in which we can pull away from some of those institutions that are asking us to create work that can only exist in those spaces and figure out ways to take art to places that are sort of much more hungry for it. And become more agile in the way in which we make art. Are there any plans to tour “Sweat” to places outside of New York? I know that Oskar Eustis became very excited when we did the production in Reading. He said he wants to fundraise to figure out a way to bring, if not “Sweat,” plays like “Sweat” to small towns that don’t have regional theaters and don’t have these big traveling houses. So that people who aren’t used to engaging with theater can come in contact with stories that really resonate with them. What if you take “Sweat” to the Rust Belt towns or upstate New York or small towns in Connecticut or around the country? How cool would it be to begin igniting some sort of dialogue around the issues that are raised in “Sweat” with people who are really touched by some of what’s happening in the play? The tail end is that we’re building this big performance and installation in Reading that will be there in July. The goal is to create something that’s really beautiful for the city, that’s reflective of all of the people; a celebration of them. Something that builds empathy, so that when they leave it, they have a greater sense of who their neighbors are and might be more inclined to reach out to them. It’s going to be at the Franklin Street railroad station in Reading, downtown. It was closed in the ‘80s and became dilapidated, and then five years ago, they renovated the space. Since then, I don’t think it’s been used for anything. So we asked if we could reanimate the space with art. We’ve done a great deal of fundraising and that’s what we’re going to do. It’s our gift to Reading. Our way of saying thank you for inviting us in and allowing us to get to know you. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity."
ARTS & CULTURE,A Devastating Story Of Friendship And Heartbreak That Definitely Passes The Bechdel Test,"“There is the body of history ever atop of us, and the body of memory rustling within us,” Hannah Lillith Assadi writes in her debut novel, Sonora. “Between the two, we are crushed.” The story, fittingly, moves in waves between past and present. While visiting her father in the hospital ― he’s being treated for pain induced by sciatica ― the narrator, Ahlam, reflects on the beginnings of her friendship with her best friend, Laura.  The two met when Ahlam, who went by Ariel when she was with everyone but her family, was a young girl living in the Arizona desert. Her father was a Palestinian taxi driver, her mother an Israeli woman who kept two jobs, at Denny’s and a dentist’s office. Assadi writes poetically about the Southwest ― the spacious, moneyed homes, the high school football stadium that looms over her hometown. “I remember the signs for new housing developments, one after the other, advertising larger and larger pools, and three instead of two-car garages,” she writes. But the fast-developing landscape is also thick with an air of threatening mystery; coyotes lurk in the distance, rain comes on suddenly, and flickering lights can be seen from mountaintops. Ahlam’s father calls his taxi his Battlestar Galactica, thinking of himself as a cosmonaut, uprooted and left to drift far from the place he loves. Ahlam is similarly adrift when she meets Laura, a girl she’s noticed walking in front of her to school, and who she continues to follow through their teenage and young adult years, to parties and eventually to New York City, where they move in with an entrepreneurial spirit, Dylan, and focus on dancing and singing. Before that, though, Ahlam relates her startling sexual awakening, a pair of encounters laced with tenderness and violence, eventually contributing to her relative abstinence for years to come.  Ahlam and Laura take their superstitious sensibilities with them to New York, where they talk of bad luck and curses, and seek out spacious places ― the abandoned buildings of the Brooklyn Navy Yard, the high knolls of the Greenwood Cemetery ― between half-hearted attempts to pursue their respective passions. Together they slide into a habit of drinking all day, and Laura gets addicted to blow. Her relationship with Dylan swerves into emotionally abusive territory, and the scintillating language Assadi used to describe the mysteries of the desert dips into the quick-and-dirty syntax of drug memoirs. Like such memoirists, Assadi sometimes relies too heavily on the book’s seductive subject matter in the story’s second half, quickly relating scenes from parties and fights and drug trips, as though the meaning and feeling behind these experiences were self-evident. Still, when she returns to the desert, her story about a heartbreaking friendship once again becomes sorrowful and singular, a mesmerizing take on tripping blindly into adulthood. The bottom line: A poetic story about friendship, loss and the fractured ways in which we assemble an identity, and a home. Who wrote it: This is Hannah Lillith Assadi’s debut novel. She lives in Brooklyn, and has her MFA in fiction from Columbia University. Who will read it: Anyone interested in coming-of-age stories, or stories set in the American Southwest. What other reviews think: Publisher’s Weekly: “The structure, moving back and forth in time and space, adds a sense of the magical to a sometimes tragic but always beautiful coming-of-age story.” Kirkus: “Lyrical, raw, and moving.” Opening lines: “I have always missed watching the sun fall down into the desert. It is always so slow. There are no windows in the waiting room. The florescence blares on despite the romance of the hour.” Notable passage: “By morning, everything way grey swept, the prickly brush swathed in rain. Inhaling the fumes of the storm, the greened soil, the sage, I knew beauty for me would only ever be derived from loss. I saw Sonora before me, so otherworldly, so desolate, some cast-out mistress on the pale blue planet, and longed suddenly to stay.” SonoraBy Hannah Lillith AssadiSoho Press, $16.00March 28, 2017 The Bottom Line is a weekly review combining plot description and analysis with fun tidbits about the book."
ARTS & CULTURE,A Painter Searches For A More Interconnected Vision Of Humanity,"In Laura Berger’s inviting paintings and ceramics, everything extraneous has been stripped away. Almost featureless nude figures cavort or repose in geometrically iterated positions, set against flattened beige backgrounds. The world, in these scenes, appears harmonious and placid: Mankind at peace.  “I’m interested in our search for a sense of belonging and meaning as individuals, and how that both contrasts and combines with our existential concerns of feeling small or insignificant in the larger world,” Berger told The Huffington Post in an email. She wants to capture “the ideas of inclusion and interconnectedness” in these works.  To evoke the profound underlying unity of the human race, she portrays the figures with pin-prick eyes and mouths, generic hairstyles and no secondary sex characteristics, á la Ken. (Barbie is different, thanks to the bosom.) “I’m ... trying to distill the environments and figures down to very minimal clean shapes as a way to really focus on emotion or story, color and composition,” she told HuffPost. The earthy, warm colors of Berger’s paintings play into her peaceful aesthetic and the rosy browns of her scenes look visually reminiscent of ancient Greek pottery paintings ― which she cites as an influence. “I’m really fascinated by ancient art that looks like it could have been made in contemporary time ― things like Japanese prints, Nayarit sculpture, Native American textiles and ledger drawings, Indonesian paintings, the modern illustrative style on Grecian vessels,” she explained. “But I’m equally interested in really abstract, graphic work. I love the large, clean shapes in paintings by Carmen Herrera, for instance, or the loose free-flowing forms and color fields in Helen Frankenthaler’s work.” The confluence of ancient and contemporary aesthetics infuses her paintings with a timelessness, a visual representation of humanity that seems suspended in amber. “When you take away everything that the world puts upon us, we are all just these beings that are so similar and so connected to each other and to our collective global history,” she said. The patterns of human figures and clean backgrounds have a geometric balance that juxtaposes with the soft bodily curves and muted palette Berger depicts. “I guess it’s sort of how life is, so that’s interesting to me,” she said. Depending on how you look at it, the human condition is either squishy and random or guided by primordial patterns ― or maybe it’s both. In her paintings, humanity isn’t divided by gender, color or class; they move as one. There’s a deeper pattern beneath the seemingly fragmented and squishy categories of people. On a cosmic level, the paintings seem to say that we have more in common than we have dividing us. ”Much of my focus has been around exploring alternate notions of ‘family’ and connection ― through our ties to the global community and to our collective ancestry, to nature and to the unknown,” Berger added. Her works soothe, suggesting a likely impossible vision of global cooperation and mutual respect.  In the real world, we do wear clothes that mark our socioeconomic statuses; we have sex organs and we engage in vicious partisan battles instead of collaborating peacefully to build a society together. In looking at Berger’s wistful paintings, we can imagine a better way."
ARTS & CULTURE,Mysterious Carving Of A Woman's Face Emerges During Church Restoration,"St. Mary’s Church in Rhode Island may be a treasure trove of secrets, and she’s just started letting them slip. The church, which went up in 1849, is best known as the locale of John Fitzgerald Kennedy and Jacqueline Bouvier’s wedding on September 12, 1953, but now it’s getting renewed attention thanks to a peculiar carving. A woman’s face was recently uncovered during a restoration of the church’s enormous 1,674-pipe organ. And the face doesn’t appear to be just any woman’s face. According to Reverend Kris von Maluski, it could be Mary Magdalene’s visage. Rev. Von Maluski talked told the Associated Press that the carved woman has “got to be significant to be on that level,” referring to the fact that her image is in line with carvings of the 12 apostles. “The organ was so massive, she was lost for a very long time,” he told the news agency. Magdalene was known as the “apostle of the Apostles,” because, according to the New Testament, she was who Jesus appeared to first after he rose from the dead. It was Magdalene who informed the Apostles of the miracle. The church’s mysterious face is split in half to form two profiles within St. Mary’s ― one in the right corner of the choir loft and one in the left. The church believes the carving dates back to when the structure was built. The church was designed by architect Patrick Keely, so Rev. von Maluski is reaching out to other churches he’s worked with in attempt to gather more information regarding the face. To properly complete the restoration around this incredible discovery, the church has decided to make the new structure smaller and with “a seven-inch gap to see the face” between the organ sides and the walls, according to The Newport Daily News. The organ will be reinstalled beginning April 18, two days after Easter Sunday. In addition to the readjusted organ installation, Newport Daily News reports that a mold of the face is being made to be put on “permanent display to the right of the altar, along with two of the original organ pipes.” “We have to give her a place of honor so she will never be lost to history again,” Rev.von Maluski told the publication."
ARTS & CULTURE,Another Reason Not To Give Up On Your Novel: J.K. Rowling Will Be Really Disappointed,"There’s a great novel inside of you, just waiting for the moment to burst out. Not sure about that? Take J.K. Rowling’s word for it. In a series of tweets ― inspired by one from Beauty Jackson, a podcast host and blogger with a sizable Twitter following ― Rowling encouraged creatives to never give up on their passion projects, even if the odds of success seem insurmountable. Here’s the original tweet, which Rowling quoted: HEY! YOU! You're working on something and you're thinking ""Nobody's gonna watch, read, listen."" Finish it anyway. There were so many times in the early 90s when I needed somebody to say this to me. It's great advice for many reasons. https://t.co/tiGpAOb4Fh In a long thread, she extols the value of finishing work even if it never finds an audience, the lessons learned by persevering in creating art, and the importance of remembering that success is not a true measure of quality. The discipline involved in finishing a piece of creative work is something on which you can truly pride yourself. Maybe your third, fourth, fiftieth song/novel/painting will be the one that 'makes it', that wins the plaudits... Maybe your third, fourth, fiftieth song/novel/painting will be the one that 'makes it', that wins the plaudits... ... but you'd never have got there without finishing the others (all of which will now be of more interest to your audience.) Easy for her to say, right? If every struggling author eventually had a smash-hit debut novel that left them multi-millionaires, if not billionaires, then, well, money would probably cease to have much meaning. It’s been well-documented how winding, and often difficult, a path Rowling took to superstardom ― a single mother who’d worked for Amnesty International and taught English in Portugal, she found herself scraping by to support her daughter in Edinburgh on state benefits while she toiled on her Harry Potter manuscript and trained to teach. After all that hard work, the book was rejected somewhere between “loads” and “12” times by publishers before Bloomsbury took a chance on the magic of Hogwarts. And, to be clear, Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone wasn’t her first novel. She wrote her first book at 6 years old; it was about a rabbit. The point is, creating stuff ― whole-cloth, out of your brain ― is difficult, and it can be exhausting. It’s especially exhausting when your work isn’t appreciated, after all the thankless hours you invested in it. But if you’re really determined and you believe in yourself, maybe you just need a solid pep talk to carry you through the tough times ― and J.K. Rowling always serves the good stuff."
ARTS & CULTURE,Meet The Women Directors Revolutionizing Horror Films,"In June, Amazonian hero Wonder Woman will make her on-screen debut. It’ll be a big moment in the comic book movie-verse ― but also for gender parity in filmmaking.  The movie is helmed by Patty Jenkins, of “Monster” fame, and it’s the first live-action project with a $100 million budget for the director. In fact, it’s only the fourth-ever film in that price range led by a woman, including Ava DuVernay’s forthcoming adaptation of A Wrinkle in Time, and Niki Caro’s recently announced “Mulan” update. As a point of reference, four films cost more than $200 million last year, with several more just below that mark, including “Finding Dory,” “Alice Through the Looking Glass,” “The Jungle Book,” “Warcraft” and “Independence Day: Resurgence.”  Despite the range of subjects falling into the big-budget category, it’s a longstanding boys’ club, with few opportunities for women directors ― even those most interested in typically higher-grossing genres. So for directors like Karyn Kusama, who helmed “The Invitation,” “Jennifer’s Body” and the 2000 Sundance Film Festival darling “Girlfight,” smaller projects provide opportunities to explore riskier subjects, to sharpen writing skills, and to tell stories that are potent and contained.  Which is why, when she was invited to participate in “XX,” an anthology of short horror films directed by women and starring women as the stories’ heroes ― as opposed to hapless, slashed-off victims ― Kusama was glad for the opportunity.  “I think that there’s something about short films that just kind of keeps your muscles sharp,” Kusama told The Huffington Post over the phone. “It’s sort of like running a 10k while you prepare for a marathon. I don’t get to run many marathons. I don’t get to make many features. It’s not like that’s something I can just snap my fingers and make happen. So for me, it was a way to stay nimble and keep telling stories, and even create the story, but have it be a slightly more manageable scale for everyone involved.” Kusama’s contribution to the anthology, which had its world premiere at Sundance on Jan. 22 and enjoyed a limited release soon after, is a riff on “Rosemary’s Baby,” which she calls a “core text” of filmmaking. In her version, Rosemary Woodhouse is a woman with a 17-year-old son who, as his 18th birthday approaches, begins behaving violently, as though possessed.  “The Rosemary Woodhouse character in ‘Rosemary’s Baby’ is quite helpless, a kind of infuriating, domesticated pet. Femininity itself is used against her,” Kusama said. “And I just wanted to imagine a world where the femininity, the vulnerability, becomes the strength. The femaleness becomes the strength, not the weakness.” Kusama emphasizes that portrayals of mothers ― especially in horror films ― too often take the “Psycho” approach, characterizing any kind of motherly strength as perverse and deforming. “I am a mother now, and I’m a mother to a son, and I want him to go into the world a feminist. I want him to go into the world with compassion for humanity,” Kusama said. “I just know I have so much to teach my child. And I just feel kind of like, what would our world be without mothers? What would our world be without mother love? I don’t think we’d have a world.” Among the anthology’s other contributors are stop-motion animator Sofia Carrillo, “Riot Girls” director Jovanka Vuckovic, “Southbound” director Roxanne Benjamin, and first-time director Annie Clark, aka rock musician St. Vincent.  These directors are among a bevy of women filmmakers interested in horror ― in working within the genre’s traditions, or in subverting them to better fit their own views. Since 2014, several woman-led horror features have left their mark, including Jennifer Kent’s “The Babadook,” Lucile Hadžihalilović’s “Evolution,” and Julia Ducournau’s “Raw.” And women directors are proliferating among the short film-making set, too; at last year’s Nitehawk Shorts Festival, for which HuffPost was a media sponsor, bloody crime flicks and mysterious stories of witches were highlights of the slate.  These stories, and those anthologized in “XX,” showcased the sensibilities of their makers, demonstrating the point that their movies needn’t be categorized as “women’s films,” but, rather, great films made by women.  “A lot of the films I think you could argue are particularly female in their vision. And they’re just turning out to be really good,” Kusama said. “That, to me, means there’s a kind of awakening of the general public’s attention toward this concept of the female voice, the female lens. And I think that’s just wonderful, because it means we get so many different visions of the world that we didn’t have before.” For Clark, who describes herself as a storyteller by nature, that vision means blurring the lines between horror and humor. Her addition to the anthology, “The Birthday Party,” involves a woman dressing up her recently deceased husband in a bear costume, to conceal his death until after her daughter’s birthday party.  “To me, the saddest part of the movie is the one that makes me cackle with laughter,” Clark told HuffPost. Elaborating on the fine line between fear and amusement, she said, “you have the same emotional exorcism, which is build up, build up, build up, tension, and very quick, sudden release. It sounds like I’m describing an orgasm. So many things work this way. It’s the same with comedy. Tension, punchline ... where are they going with this? Oh, they land it, there’s the punchline. There’s the release. They’re very linked, I would say.” Unlike the other directors in “XX,” Clark has never directed a feature-length film ― although she plans to in the future. For her, directing a short was a launching pad for future filmmaking projects ― a common trajectory for those exploring the storytelling medium for the first time. For Benjamin ― who’s become somewhat of a horror anthology expert, between her work on “Southbound” and “V/H/S” ― the shorter form has merits that she says feature-length films might not. Her contribution to the anthology, “Don’t Fall,” is about four friends who discover a mysterious cave painting while camping in the desert. The visitors are glib about the cultural significance of the painting, and the land in general, and their glibness comes at a cost.  “You’ve got these privileged people coming in who just tromp all over another culture without thinking about it, because they think everything is for them. But what if the land fights back?” Benjamin told HuffPost. “If you get into a feature-length version of that, then you have to start explaining why this is happening. The thing that always feels the weakest in any horror movie is when you get into the explanation of why this is happening, rather than just letting it unfold.” “A lot of shorts in the genre space tend to be morality tales,” she continued. “If you think of ‘The Twilight Zone’ or ‘Black Mirror,’ they work because of the length that they are. These stories don’t necessarily hold as features, but they work in a short format. If you tried to put that into a feature format, it would start to get pedantic.” So, while Benjamin’s film differs from Clark’s and Kusama’s, each director voiced merits of the short film genre, and gratitude for the opportunity to work on the project. But, Kusama expressed hope that the anthology would be a springboard, for future, better-paying work, and proof that women-led films are diverse and engaging.  “Now that we’ve gotten this first female-led anthology off the ground, I’d love for us to imagine and create a world where more of these films can exist, and women can actually pay their bills,” she said.  “I do think it’s harder to tell female stories without getting put into some kind of fantasy box. Other people’s fantasies about what women should look like and sound like,” Kusama continued. “But once you see stories that actually portray complicated women ― and I’ll go a step further and say portray complicated people generally ― we’re just excited by that. I actually think audiences are starving for it.” The “XX” horror anthology will be available in Blu-ray, DVD and Digital HD May 23 from Magnolia Home Entertainment under the Magnet Label. This year’s Nitehawk Shorts Festival will take place Nov. 7-12 at the cinema’s location in Brooklyn, New York. Huffington Post Arts & Culture is the Media Sponsor for the festival and will provide the Huffington Post Impact Award. For filmmakers looking to submit their own short films, early submission to the festival opens on Monday, April 3. Read more about the requirements for entry here."
ARTS & CULTURE,Marvel Exec Suggests Comic Sales Fell Because Readers 'Didn’t Want Female Characters',"Over the past few years, the elite club of iconic comic superheroes went from being exclusively white and male ― Superman, Batman, Spider-Man, Iron Man, all the mans ― to incorporating women and people of color into its super-roster. For example, a Pakistani-American teenager named Kamala Khan became the new Ms. Marvel, and a black science prodigy named Riri Williams made her own Iron Man suit, taking up the Ironheart mantle. Bad Feminist author Roxanne Gay became the first black woman to write for Marvel; her series “World of Wakanda” revolves around queer heroines in an all-women fighting force, based in a fictional African country. Unfortunately, these initial, long overdue attempts to broaden the definition of who a hero can be are now being blamed for the decline in comic-book sales in 2016. In an interview with “geek culture” website ICv2, Marvel’s vice president of sales David Gabriel said he was told by comic retailers that customers “didn’t want any more diversity.”   Gabriel continued: They didn’t want female characters out there. That’s what we heard, whether we believe that or not. I don’t know that that’s really true, but that’s what we saw in sales. We saw the sales of any character that was diverse, any character that was new, our female characters, anything that was not a core Marvel character, people were turning their nose up against. That was difficult for us because we had a lot of fresh, new, exciting ideas that we were trying to get out and nothing new really worked. Many were quick to challenge Gabriel’s hypothesis that diversity was to blame for a lapse in sales, instead of the fact that most comic books tell the same damn stories over and over and over again. One vocal commenter was the creator of the newest Ms. Marvel herself, G. Willow Wilson. In a blog post responding to the controversial statements, Wilson discussed the various other factors that turn readers off from new comic protagonists that don’t relate to their race and gender ― like, for example, that they tend to kill off the reigning, beloved hero and assume his or her position, likely to anger devoted fans.  Most notably, Wilson took issue with the framing of non-white male characters as “diverse,” instead of just realistic. “Diversity as a form of performative guilt doesn’t work,” she wrote. “Let’s scrap the word diversity entirely and replace it with authenticity and realism. This is not a new world. This is *the world.*” Others on Twitter chimed in with similar sentiments, expressing that Marvel’s blatant lag time in expanding its catalog of leading characters likely turned readers off as much if not more than their eventual attempts at inclusion.  However, it’s not all that hard to imagine readers “turning their noses up,” as Gabriel put it, at the concept of being saved by a teenage girl. Just think of the unfathomable wrath generated by the all-female reboot of “Ghostbusters” and the December 2015 installment of “Star Wars,” fronted by a woman and a black man. Sociologists and scholars have studied the propensity for misogyny in stereotypically “nerdy” communities. Very succinctly put, participants in geek culture, often excluded from traditional displays of masculinity, seek protected communities to experience male privileges of dominance, acceptance and superiority.  The good news, however, is that Gabriel is determined not to let the decline in sales deter Marvel’s path toward representation and widespread visibility. “Let me be clear,” he wrote in a clarifying statement following his initial remarks, “our new heroes are not going anywhere! We are proud and excited to keep introducing unique characters that reflect new voices and new experiences into the Marvel universe and pair them with our iconic heroes.” Comic buffs and feminist nerds, if you’re reading, now is the time to support the comic heroes you’d like to see more of. In real life, it’s often women and people of color who put in work to make the world a brighter, safer place. Let’s have our comics tell truthful stories that reflect the world around us, whether or not they involve flying around cities in tight suits and capes.   "
ARTS & CULTURE,"'S-Town,' New Podcast From 'Serial' Creators, Makes History","Listeners aren’t wasting any time before getting hooked on “S-Town,” a seven-part podcast from the creators of “Serial” and “This American Life.”  The nonfiction series, which follows a man who restores antique clocks, has been downloaded more than 10 million times since its release on Tuesday, according to Variety. The entertainment news site reports that it reached the 10 million mark in four days, a podcast record.  All seven parts of “S-Town” were released at once. They’re meant to feel more like chapters of a novel than episodes of a television show, host Brian Reed told The Huffington Post last month. “My hope for it is that people listen to this kind of in the way that they would read a novel,” Reed said. “Maybe you do it all at once. You sit down and tear through it and that’d be awesome. I’m not saying you shouldn’t do that.” The main character of “S-Town” is John B. McLemore, whose nickname for his hometown of Woodstock, Alabama ― “Shittown” ― inspired the title.   “It’s a worldview, basically. And we hope that the title points you to that,” Reed told HuffPost. “That it’s a way that John saw the world, and I think a lot of people see the world that way. I think it’s something worth interrogating.” McLemore originally contacted Reed in 2014 about looking into a death in Woodstock, but the series is less a true crime investigation than “a deep dive into one man’s mental health” and “the insurmountable challenge of living that any of us might seem to face at one point or another,” as Vox put it.  “S-Town” is a project of Serial Productions and created by a group of radio and podcasting heavy-hitters who worked on “This American Life” and “Serial,” including Ira Glass, Sarah Koenig, Julie Snyder and Starlee Kine.  Serial Productions had a major hit in 2014 with “Serial,” the true crime podcast Koenig narrated that investigated the 1999 murder of high school student Hae Min Lee and her ex-boyfriend Adnan Syed’s claim that he was innocent. The first two seasons of “Serial” have been downloaded more than 250 million times, according to Variety.  “S-Town” is available for free download on its website,  iTunes, Stitcher, and other podcasting platforms."
ARTS & CULTURE,Is Kenyatta A.C. Hinkle The Anti-Schutz?,"The clutter of opinion around the Dana Schutz Whitney Biennial painting “Open Casket” is like embers that have found a source in which to maintain an inferno. In the heat of this ongoing moment, the discussion itself becomes the topic, taking precedence over the artwork and the contexts in which the painting was created and presented. When considering a controversial artwork, whether one seeking to bait headlines or one subject to unpredicted reaction, sometimes it is best to locate and consider the merits of an opposite artwork. Finding an opposite artwork to contrast to this picture can bring the discussion back on the thing that will outlast all protests, actions, “takes”, socal media posts and the inevitable careerist symposia: the actual artwork. In this exercise, the wonder and potential liberation from the ordinary that art offers us can be better measured when the things that are absent in one artwork are achingly present in the other. Can the thesis survive an encounter with its antithesis? Imagine the riveting solo show by Kenyatta A.C. Hinkle “The Evanesced” at the California African American Museum as possibly the opposite artwork from Schutz’ “Open Casket”. Schutz, a white woman, has painted an abstracted version of an iconic image of black trauma that was a catalyst in propelling the civil rights movement forward. Hinkle, an African American woman, has painted expressionistic images of anonymous contemporary black women who have disappeared with many, it is feared, having been kidnapped and murdered. Hinkle paints the horror of not knowing a specific trauma yet knowing specfic trauma is being perpetuated. In a sensitive curation, CAAM’s deputy director Naima Keith places large, almost life-sized portraits of vanished women, leading us to a back wall hosting a seeming infinity of smaller, but no less intense, renderings of the same subject… the nameless, and here sometimes shapeless missing. Schutz has the comfort of sixty years separating her from the gruesome murder of Emmett Till and, as evinced by the title of her piece, investigates from the perspective of a mother (a point she reiterated in defending her picture to the attacks and protests it has engendered). The context of Dana Schutz’ race has been debated ad nauseum, but in contrast, as a black woman, Hinkle delivers the pictorial equivalent of the Phil Ochs ode, “There But For Fortune Go I”. If Schutz meant for her Till portrait to carry forth the image of that murder into a different medium - and the jeremiads about her motives in doing just this have been downright unfair and border on the self-serving - she cannot evade the scrutiny of having made a prop out of the whole Till epic. Painting’s capacity to mythologize is its conceptual strength, but with great strength comes great responsibility. One can see that the aim of the Schutz piece is to avoid caricature, but she falls short of any impact that the infamous documentation of Till’s actual open casket did not already convey. Bringing nothing new to the subject she unwittingly made herself the subject, hence the endless contextualizing of the picture as inextricably linked to its author’s whiteness. Ever the opposite, “The Evanesced” gives viewers what contemporary painting is best at delivering. Hinkle’s ambiguous subjects are concretely defined by their fate as the casual expressionism of her brushwork evokes the anonymity of the subjects. She expertly marks what might be trauma with spatial composition that vaguely illustrates what also might be movement. We see the subjects as present yet evasive. They are both both form and concept. Alive and yet ellusive, they are concretely evanescent. To nail a concrete paradox is a masterful accomplishment not every artist will come close too in their lifetime. Schutz reached to make an epic pictorial statement and failed. The punishment in the press for this failure is not what painters need to see. Risks need to be taken, and therefore encouraged, or painting is just the home decoration wing of the entertainment-industrial complex. Hinkle meanwhile delves into the invisible horrors right in front of us all and creates work that avoids exploitation, balancing the tragic with the poignant. It is too bad the firestorm of scorn aimed at Dana Schutz cannot somehow be transfigured into accolades for Kenyatta A.C. Hinkle. “Kenyatta A.C. Hinkle: The Evanesced,” curated by Naima J. Keith, runs at the California African American Museum in L.A.’s Exposition Park until June 25."
ARTS & CULTURE,Pop Art Pioneer James Rosenquist Dead At 83,"Artist James Rosenquist, a leading figure of the 1960s pop art movement known for his room-sized works, has died at the age of 83, his studio said. Rosenquist helped define the genre of color-bursting displays of common objects that was also championed by the likes Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein. He died on Friday, the studio said, without providing further details. Rosenquist had early experience as a billboard painter, which became a springboard for presentations of images that he culled from sources including print advertisements and magazines, it said. He had shows in some of the world’s most celebrated museums, including New York’s Museum of Modern Art and the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao in Spain, it said. “Painting is probably much more exciting than advertising,” Rosenquist was quoted as saying by the Museum of Modern Art. “So why shouldn’t it be done with that power and gusto, with that impact.” One of his more celebrated works is “F-111,’ which is billboard in size and made in 1964 and 1965, during the U.S. war in Vietnam. It combines images including a U.S. military warplane, a bombing and scenes of American prosperity, including a smiling blonde girl sitting under a hair dryer reminiscent of a missile, the museum said. His celebrated 1962 painting of Marilyn Monroe was created shortly after her death and shows fragmented images of the global star that includes a segment of the Coca-Cola brand name, it said. Rosenquist was born in Grand Forks, North Dakota where he had a nomadic life that took him and his parents to about a half dozen places including in Minnesota and Ohio. He studied at the University of Minnesota and moved to New York in his twenties. “Painting has everything to do with memory. Images of the unexpected, the surreal, well up unbidden in your mind - as do things you haven’t resolved,” he said in his autobiography written with David Dalton titled “Painting Below Zero.” "

ARTS & CULTURE,How 'The Mindy Project' Embraced And Transcended The Traditional Rom-Com,"When Mindy Kaling’s show “The Mindy Project” premiered in 2012, few would have accused it of having an after-school special vibe. Her character, a Manhattan OB/GYN with a romantic comedy addiction and an endless parade of hot (and white) boyfriends, had no concerns outside of getting introduced to NBA players at clubs and running into her ex at a friend’s Thanksgiving. But over the course of five seasons, a move to Hulu, and myriad exclamations of “exsqueeze me??”, the picture has changed.  “When we first started the show, I think, at first, we weren’t talking about [social issues] as much,” writer Ike Barinholtz, who also plays the delightfully awful nurse Morgan Tookers on the show, told The Huffington Post in a phone conversation. “But I think the world’s changed a little bit.”   Season five of “The Mindy Project” wrapped up on Tuesday with (spoiler alert!) Mindy Lahiri’s just-okay proposal to boyfriend Ben (Bryan Greenberg). Soon after, EW reported that the sitcom would be returning to Hulu for a sixth season, which will also be its last. In five seasons, “The Mindy Project” has been through more ups and downs than the average TV show; cancelled by Fox after three seasons on the air, the show was picked up by Hulu as a streaming series. There’s been no shortage of drama on-screen as well. Mindy Lahiri, the OB/GYN played by show creator Kaling, has been engaged (several times), had a child, split up with her son’s father, started her own fertility business, and now is poised to be a stepmother to a tween girl. In its first season, the show took flak from critics for being too surface-level, too girly and, oddly enough, too white (especially Mindy’s parade of pale boyfriends). On the verge of its final season, the show has quietly become a consistently political one. That’s not to say that the show traffics in “Saturday Night Live”-level satire. The presidential election didn’t become a plot point on the fifth season, or even fodder for copious jokes. But increasingly throughout its run, and particularly during its post-Season-3 incarnation on Hulu, “The Mindy Project” has specialized in bold, high-concept episodes that push its protagonist and audience to grapple with race, gender and class privilege.  “I think in earlier seasons of the show, Mindy Kaling wanted to just present a normal sitcom about dating, when she is sort of a nontraditional sitcom lead,” “Mindy” writer Lang Fisher told HuffPost. In the show creators’ eyes, Kaling taking on the role of an adorable rom-com lead, when she doesn’t resemble the typical tiny blonde American romantic heroine, constituted the show’s most potent political message. Not all critics saw it that way.  “When she did come under fire for being conventional and yada yada, I think that was upsetting because she’s not conventional. No one else looks like her on TV, particularly when this show started,” said Lang. “I think it was very hard for her to be criticized for that when many other shows with all-white casts were never criticized.” The show’s early treatments of race bear a whiff of defensiveness, or at least hyperawareness of its detractors. Barinholtz cowrote one of the first episodes that explicitly addressed race: “Mindy Lahiri Is a Racist,” which appeared in Season 2 ― after the show had been knocked around by critics of Mindy’s exclusively white male fellow doctors and romantic interests. “I remember in the writers room that summer, Mindy was like, let’s do a really really funny race episode,” he said. The result: An installment in which an expecting mother endorses Mindy’s practice on her white supremacist parenting blog, inspiring the crunchy liberal midwives in an adjoining office to lead an anti-racism crusade against them. It turns out that it’s being accused of racism that brings out the doctors’ worst impulses: Dr. Danny Castellano (Chris Messina) indignantly protests that (unlike Mindy) he’s dated many non-white people. Mindy thinks her own race precludes the possibility of her racism, even as she talks down to the practice’s black nurse, Tamra (Xosha Roquemore). “Sometimes you can get a little ‘Downton Abbey,’” Tamra points out.  Somehow, it’s fratty white doctor Peter (Adam Pally) who salvages the practice’s reputation ― he wants to start a mobile service to bring women’s healthcare to underserved communities. The episode teased out Mindy’s own deeply conservative (“she kind of notoriously thinks Chris Christie is right on,” said Barinholtz) and even racist tendencies. “I went to second base with my friend Korean Justin!” her character brags in front of a PR consultant brought in to fix the practice’s racist reputation. “His hands were so small, they made my boobs look enormous.” But the episode also highlights the hypocrisy of the virtue-signaling white liberals around her. “Sister Tamra, you work at Shulman & Associates,” one of the white, male midwives urges Tamra at a rally. “Tell us how much it’s like 1950s Birmingham.” He’s not so much offering her a chance to speak as he is pushing her to ventriloquize his own talking points. And while the episode lightly jabbed at critics who seemed to expect far more from her than her white showrunning peers, it also honestly and hilariously explored the problematic beliefs that lie behind the tolerant, egalitarian faces social progressives put out into the world. It turned out, though, that “The Mindy Project” had more to say about race ― on its own terms this time. Even as headlines about Mindy’s lily-white boyfriends were supplanted by hot takes on newer show, the sitcom was getting more pointed in its social commentary. The show was ready to expand its scope. “We’ve already made the point that she can have a conventional sitcom,” Fisher said. “So… what other points can she make as this character?” For one thing, the show is ready to get a little weird. “The Mindy Project” follows the romantic comedy model, right down to Mindy’s own conviction that she’s perpetually moments away from finding herself the star in a real-life iteration of the form. The show has always been littered with bizarre meet-cutes and dramatic confessions of long-festering love.  “We’ve paid homage to these different rom-com tropes, and we kind of have just wanted to have a little more fun with some of the weird ones, like the ‘Sliding Doors’ and ‘Groundhog Day,’” Fisher added. Sometimes the lessons are romantic ― forcing Mindy to relive one day until she understands what she did wrong to lead her boyfriend Ben to dump her ― but other times, those tropes are repurposed completely. In “Mindy Lahiri Is a White Man,” she’s passed over for a second interview for head of obstetrics at the hospital. All the second-round candidates are white men. Even though she eagerly assured the board ― in response to some truly horrifying and possibly illegal questions ― that she could balance the job with motherhood by working instead of exercising, and that she could keep her emotions in check to lead, she was ignored in favor of less-qualified male candidates. “I wish I was a white man,” she sighs before bed that night. And so she wakes up as a white man: Michael Lancaster, played by Ryan Hansen. Suddenly, her life is awesome. Michael’s ex takes care of their kids, and no one is worried that he can’t balance his role as a father with a demanding job. He can get ready for work and look professional in five minutes. He can pee standing up. Her coworkers listen to him respectfully and laugh at his jokes. Unfortunately for him, Michael can’t really enjoy all this privilege; he’s too aware of the flip side. After another doctor, Dr. Irene Lee, covers for a procedure while Michael is hungover, he realizes that quiet, self-effacing Dr. Lee is a supremely competent and qualified candidate for the head of obstetrics job. As an Indian-American woman, Mindy asked Dr. Lee not to sit near her in the waiting room so people wouldn’t think they were an “Asian clique”; as a white man, he feels thrilled to have the power to get his colleague noticed. Michael coaches his new friend on speaking confidently, grooming herself and dressing herself more attractively, and insists that the board give Dr. Lee a second interview.  Still, Dr. Lee doesn’t get the job ― in fact, the board tries to offer it to Michael, impressed with his dedication to diversity. Apparently it takes more than one woke white man to fix systemic injustice. “There’s a million great things about being a white guy, and that’s just counting the things you can do with your penis,” Michael/Mindy reflects that night. “But the sad thing is having the ability to help other people, and most of the time just not doing it. It’s just so easy not to. Your life is so carefree.” Unusually for a protagonist dealing with a body-switch scenario (see: “Freaky Friday” and “The Switch”), she’s realized that the other person’s life really is as amazing as it seemed to her. Nonetheless, she wants her life back ― despite the disadvantages, she realizes, she likes being an Indian woman. The episode explores how being a white man both is and isn’t a silver bullet ― even a white doctor who’s losing it mentally and may have killed his wife is more likely to get a management job than an Asian-American woman (after all, his late spouse was “a difficult woman”). But a white man can’t fix oppression with the force of his convictions; it takes more work than that. Plus, it’s hard to remember to do the right thing when the world around you seems relatively pleasant and welcoming. Ultimately Mindy takes a lesson away from the experience: She befriends Dr. Lee. Only hanging out with white men seemed safer, cloaking her with an aura of simultaneous chillness and importance in a way that being in an “Asian clique” wouldn’t. Now, she’s done playing that game; it didn’t work anyway. In many ways, as the show takes pains to uncover, Mindy’s problematic views come from a misguided desire to identify with society’s power brokers, to shine as the one worthy woman. She’s driven to be hot, stylish, popular, chill and successful, all in one package; to be Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, and the Gillian Flynn-esque Cool Girl. In another Season 5 episode, “Mindy Lahiri Is a Misogynist,” the male doctors at Shulman & Associates set out to hire another doctor ― a female one. Worried about losing her special spot as the only female doctor in the practice, Mindy tries to push a sweaty, sloppily dressed male doctor who has lost his medical school diploma as a superior choice.  “Mindy, every one of the female candidates was far more qualified than that walking MRSA infection,” Dr. Jeremy Reed (Ed Weeks) points out with withering calm. “Let’s face it: You’re kind of a misogynist.” A new doctor is hired ― Anna, a gorgeous, chilly blonde ― and Mindy immediately clashes with her new competition, noting in a burgeoning rage that her devoted fan Morgan has already begun sucking up to the new woman doctor. When Mindy misses an appointment, Anna takes her favorite patient; Mindy’s supposedly egalitarian male colleagues snicker over the “catfight” between the two. By the end of the episode, she realizes that she’s only jostling with Anna because the patriarchy has socialized her to do so. “I was raised in a system, created by men, that has pitted women against each other,” she proclaims. (You could imagine this Mindy flaunting a brightly colored “The Future Is Female” T-shirt.) She decides to forge a consciously feminist but tenuous peace with the new doctor. It’s not a friendship, but a small, determined step toward smashing the patriarchy. In “Mindy Lahiri Is a Racist,” she goes one step further: Not only is cutting down other women selfish and wrong, she realizes, it’s painfully clear that taking the side of white men didn’t offer her the status she thought it might. All it accomplished was cutting her off from having a support system of other women like her. Barinholtz told HuffPost that the show tries to avoid “coming off preachy” when incorporating more serious issues into storylines. “I think that’s kind of the death of a sitcom,” he said. But Mindy’s awakening isn’t always subtle. Sometimes, if not most of the time, there are monologues. Mindy’s speech apologizing for mistreating her female colleague is perhaps the least subtle approach to a pro-feminist monologue possible. “I was taught to believe that men can only handle one woman at a time,” she declares. “So it’s not my fault that I was threatened by Anna. It’s the fault of the patriarchy.”   It’s impossible to miss and difficult to misconstrue the point the show is trying to make when Mindy delivers the moral; the humor comes mostly from hearing moral preaching from a character who is gleefully shallow, politically incorrect and often selfish. “The fact that she is on the wrong side of the issue is what’s surprising and kind of funny about her as a character,” said Fisher. “The moral is always correct, even if she has a hard time getting around to it.” The essential flavor of the show has remained unchanged, despite its more serious bent. “I think the character is such a deeply ingrained creation of Mindy Kaling that it’s hard for her not to be consistent,” Fisher told HuffPost. “We all have absorbed that character in our bones at this point.” Season 5 of “The Mindy Project” opened with a typically flippant joke: The premiere episode dropped in the midst of election season, and was titled “Decision 2016.” It was about Mindy’s decision between two hot, white male love interests. The show barely touched the election, though other politically minded sitcoms did. Outside of the show, Barinholtz has suggested Mindy Lahiri might be a Trump voter ― and what about Morgan?  “I could see him getting very easily fleeced by Jill Stein,” he suggested. “I could see him writing in someone, writing in, like, Cesar Millan, the Dog Whisperer.” After five seasons, “The Mindy Project” has never been more well-positioned to take on Trump-era politics. But how can the show make that funny? “Honestly… it’s just so sad,” said Barinholtz. “I think we had a joke last year where [Jody] was like, ‘And for the record, I think Donald Trump would be fun as president.’ That joke worked in like, October of 2016. In March or April of 2017, we’re seeing just how much has changed.”  It’s not just the political context; the show has changed too. Perhaps making the Trump presidency funny in a sitcom universe is impossible, but “The Mindy Project” has a good shot. You can be highbrow. You can be lowbrow. But can you ever just be brow?

ARTS & CULTURE,Mary Gaitskill On Rape Culture And Her New Essay Collection ‘Somebody With A Little Hammer’,"Mary Gaitskill would like to make a revision.  We’re standing in her Williamsburg kitchen, attached to an entryway lined with bookshelves, clay masks and other artwork. She’s offered me tea ― mint or lemon ginger ― and has just remembered that there’s a third variety available, Earl Grey. Her tone is tentative, not due to nerves, it seems, but a desire to be as accurate as possible. I assure her that mint is fine, and we sit down to talk about her essay collection, Somebody With a Little Hammer. This aversion to hasty conclusions is what makes her essay-writing resonate; in her explorations of music, literature, politics and rape culture she allows space for her own subjective impressions to shift shape. She references scrapped earlier drafts and, in many cases, winds up contradicting her initial argument, realizing her true beliefs through writing.  The essays are revealing of a gentler side of Gaitskill, one that even her ardent admirers ― that is, most women who count themselves bookish and subversive ― seem not to embrace. Since the release of her 1988 collection Bad Behavior, stories centered on the lives of sex workers, sadomasochists and victims of off-kilter power dynamics, she’s earned a reputation as raw and enterprising. In her story “Secretary” (which was later adapted into a movie starring Maggie Gyllenhaal), a woman accepts a check from her former boss, at a job she left because he repeatedly asked to spank her, and, intimidated by his more powerful position, she complied. In a story from a later collection, “The Girl on the Plane,” a man confesses a violent act to his attractive seatmate, who is mortified by his story. In yet another, “The Nice Restaurant,” a couple talks obliquely about their fetishes over dinner, and the woman learns that her boyfriend once slept with his maid, who she believes was cornered into the encounter even if she aired consent.  “Even if she’s not technically being raped, if she says ‘no,’ what’s going to happen? Is she going to lose her job? It’s a situation that just on the face of it is wrong,” Gaitskill said. “I think it’s a bad thing. I think maybe another word should be invented. I think there are a lot of really bad things that people can do sexually that are not rape.” In her nonfiction writing, Gaitskill is able to communicate this idea more clearly than in her short stories, which by nature are more emotional, and interpretable. In explaining the difference between essay writing and story writing, she said, “It’s usually just a very clear-cut thing. This is what I was to describe, this is what I think about it, this is what I feel about it, this is the argument that I’m trying to put forward. [...] I guess I think that essay writing is a far more rational process. And I find it easier, honestly.” In her 1995 essay “The Trouble With Following the Rules,” anthologized in her new collection, Gaitskill writes about a similar scenario that she was subjected to herself ― one that she describes as emotionally wrecking, even if it couldn’t legally be categorized as rape. She had sex with a man out of fear of saying no, but suspected that if she had, he would have eventually backed off.  “The thing that was confusing about that ― still ― is I just don’t know what would have happened. [...] My guess is that he would have been disgruntled, and been like, ‘aw, man.’ I think he would have tried to make me feel bad, but I don’t think he would have physically assaulted me,” she said. So, she wrote the ‘95 essay to explore the nuances of sexual power imbalances. “It seemed like something that needed to be said,” Gaitskill explained. “Because people were describing things that in my mind weren’t very simple in simplistic terms.” If there’s anything that unites the essays in her collection ― which include a reflection on her lost cat, an homage to Nabokov and the various book jackets that decorate his opus Lolita, and a takedown of Gillian Flynn’s Gone Girl ― it’s an allergy to “simplistic terms.” In her new collection, Gaitskill repeatedly praises the mysterious, and bristles at blunt, straightforward claims. She celebrates Nicholson Baker’s “chaotic,” pornographic novel The Fermata, over its “witty, pleasant” precursor, Vox. Her biggest complaint about Flynn’s best-selling thriller is the “chirpy” narration of both protagonists, which she found to be “disturbing” in a way that the author might not have intended.  “It’s super-calculating. It’s mask-like,” she said. “And I do see it a lot. I see it in social discourse, I see it in a lot of contemporary writing. People are summed up like that, and it’s based on some gesture that they made or their tone of voice, or age. A combination of their age, their appearance and some gesture that they made. Bang, that’s it. And there’s nothing else. And it’s assumed that everybody knows exactly what those things mean.” This, Gaitskill says, is one of the reasons she’s stayed off social media. She considered signing up for Twitter when the platform started growing in popularity, around 2011, an emotionally fraught period for her personally. “I thought it would just be positively dangerous for me to get on Twitter at night, when I’ve had a little too much to drink, and start expressing myself,” she said. “It’s one thing to do that with somebody who you’re looking at, and who may think you’re a drunken idiot or an unstable person, but at least you’re looking at that person. With Twitter it’s like, you don’t even see who they are.” She does see the value in Twitter or Facebook for publicizing things like political rallies, and is still considering signing up for that reason.  On the topic of snap judgements and obfuscated identities, Gaitskill steered our conversation toward politics. Her essays include comments about John McCain, and Sarah Palin’s conduct on the 2008 campaign trail, which she saw as cloying and “sadistic.” “Sarah Palin looked so terrifying to me,” Gaitskill said. “It looks a little naive in a way. She seems almost a little cartoonish in comparison with what’s happening [now].” Still, she maintains that Palin terrifies her — due to her “aggressively charming voice,” a sheeny presentation that repeatedly unnerves Gaitskill, no matter what form it takes. In “Remain in Light,” her essay in praise of the Talking Heads album of the same name, she writes about the rigid social order of junior high school and how the fluidity of music helped her survive it. “I was afraid because I was looking at a world of signifiers and abstraction, broad basic swatches of symbols and experience expressed in symbols that were both general and refined,” she writes. For this reason, she initially had an aversion to the poppy sheen of the Talking Heads’ early work, but was transformed by their 1979 album, about which she wrote, “It was like the hard, clever form of their songs had burst [...] Listening was like going through a tiny door and coming out somewhere vast, with thousands of doors and windows to a thousand other places.” It’s no wonder that Gaitskill ― with her interest in unconventional pop songs and taboo romances ― has a deep admiration for Nabokov’s Lolita, a book that manages to be about both seedy obsession and true love. In her essay “Pictures of Lo,” she writes that the book depicts “love crying with pain as it is crushed into the thorned corner of a torture garden ― but it is still love.” It’s a fitting takeaway coming from the same author who wrote “A Romantic Weekend,” a short story about a man and a woman who’ve miscommunicated about their sadomasochistic wants, leaving each of them unsatisfied. When asked whether she’d categorize any of her own stories as love stories, Gaitskill cited her 2016 novel The Mare, narrated by a woman, Ginger, and Velvet, the girl she cares for as part of a Fresh Air Fund-like program. Velvet gets wrapped up in a relationship with a boy named Dominic, but keeps the details of her sexual awakening to herself, distancing her from her mother and Ginger.  “It’s a very small love story, but it is a love story,” Gaitskill says, then, after a time, adds, “There must be something else. Hold on.”  Gaitskill gets up from her seat at her kitchen table and heads to her modest entryway library, shuffling through copies of her own books, thumbing through the Index sections. “‘Romantic Weekend,’ no. ‘Secretary,’ no,” she says. “Don’t tell me there’s nothing.”  She returns to the table with her bibliography in tow, her novels Veronica and Two Girls, Fat and Thin among the stack. After a time, she decides on three stories, counting them on her fingers, listing them as evidence: “Don’t Cry,” “Today I’m Yours” and “The Blanket.” She’s amused by the task, but satisfied to have completed it.  “You don’t have to write love stories,” I say, laughing now, too. “You don’t have to write anything.” “I mean they’re nice,” she says. “They’re part of the experience of the world.”"
ARTS & CULTURE,"R.I.P. Dandelion, The First Crayola Crayon To 'Retire' From The 24-Pack","Earlier this week, Crayola announced its plan to “retire” a crayon from its classic 24-pack. Although the hue in question was not supposed to be revealed until Friday (known to coloring aficionados as National Crayon Day), the truly historic news slipped out early. On Thursday, the world learned that the color “announcing his retirement” is ... Dandelion. For those who haven’t examined a Crayola box since pre-K, Dandelion is a yellowish crayon, not to be confused with actual “yellow,” “yellow green” or “green yellow.”  Crayola confirmed the news on Twitter, posting a strange video of an animated Mr. Dandelion traveling the world as a free man crayon. If you don’t like to imagine your box of crayons as animate beings trapped eternally in a cardboard box, you might not want to watch the clip. Our beloved Dandelion decided to announce his retirement early! There’s no taming an adventurous spirit! #NationalCrayonDay pic.twitter.com/RMk6pw3jR2 Although the retired shade will no longer be produced as a crayon, it will live on in Crayola’s Color Hall of Fame. And if you aren’t quite ready to say goodbye, there is a Facebook live-stream planned for tomorrow to ceremoniously break the news.   For any skeptics thinking this whole thing is an elaborate April Fools’ Day prank, think again. “I can confirm this is NOT an April Fools’ stunt and Dandelion is the color the brand will be retiring,” a publicist assured The Huffington Post. Time to face reality, people. Dandelion is no more. Will you be mourning crayon life sans Dandelion’s yellowy touch?

ARTS & CULTURE,"Artist Creates Haunting Ode To The Countless Black, Female Bodies That Have Disappeared","Last week, people of color mobilized on social media to spread awareness of the alarming number of black and brown young women currently considered “critically missing” in Washington, D.C.  The viral effort, along with sharing facts regarding the missing teens, encouraged others to question why cases about missing black women often go uncovered by the nightly news and other mainstream media sources. “As a society, we only pay attention when a particular type of woman goes missing,” artist Kenyatta A.C. Hinkle told The Huffington Post.  For years, Hinkle has used her artistic practice to explore black female bodies ― how they navigate multiple geographies simultaneously and how they react to the narratives and perceptions thrust upon them. Her current exhibition, titled “The Evanesced,” features 100 drawings, which Hinkle describes as “un-portraits,” evoking black women who have gone missing, whose bodies and lives have been erased.  The show has been on view at the California African American Museum since early March, before the recently heightened scrutiny over D.C.’s missing girls. But for Hinkle, the work’s timeliness is far from surprising. “It’s not a strange coincidence because this erasure happens every day, all over the nation,” she said. “It has been a state of emergency for a long time. It just depends on who is looking at it and who is talking about it.” Before “The Evanesced,” Hinkle created a series called “The Uninvited,” based upon 19th-century photographs of West African women taken by French colonialists. The images depicted their subjects monolithically and aggressively, propelling myths of black women as hypersexual and primitive, coercing their bodies into poses that fit the fantasy.  Using intricate lines and watery clouds of color, Hinkle disrupted the colonialist narratives, transforming the photographed women into goddesses, monsters and hybrid creatures in between. The images simultaneously alluded to the violence being enacted within the photos while eclipsing it with power, beauty and wrath. “I could feel things from those photographs,” Hinkle said. “I’m an empath.” The colonialist photos, which were printed on postcards and widely distributed throughout Europe, plainly communicate the degree to which men assumed ownership of and agency over black women’s bodies. Not much has changed, Hinkle believes, between the 19th century and today. “I have this mantra of looking at the historical present,” Hinkle said. “I’m always between these two places, where our past and present collide. If we don’t recognize our history, we’re constantly going to be in the residue of it.” Hinkle began formulating her concept for “The Evanesced” after learning about the case of Lonnie Franklin Jr., also known as the “Grim Sleeper,” a serial killer convicted of killing at least 10 black women in the Los Angeles area between 1985 and 2007. “He amassed a private archive of almost 1,000 photos of women,” Hinkle said. “Police are still trying to identify what happened to them.”  Franklin’s photo trove triggered memories of the unnamed, unidentifiable black women depicted in the colonial postcards. “I started thinking about what it means to be erased in a contemporary context,” Hinkle said. “What does it mean to emerge from this kind of erasure?” The deeper the artist dug into her research, the more horrific the findings were. Hinkle claimed that in 2010, 64,000 missing black women remained unfound, citing a number that made its rounds on the internet in the years since; she described the number as “unfathomable, sublime.” When her peers learned she was researching missing black women, they shared stories of other cases and names. The black female bodies kept piling up.  For Hinkle, “The Evanesced” is about more than the Grim Sleeper, or the missing D.C. girls, or any one person or case. As she put it: “If I draw these women, then what about the others?”  Additionally, the artist didn’t want to portray a real person, a real life ripped away, without doing the proper legwork. “I would want to spend time with the families and get to know them,” Hinkle said. “I am very critical of someone who comes into a community and makes work about it. I wouldn’t want someone to say, ‘That doesn’t look like Rachel.’ Then you are further erasing her.” The sentiment rings especially true following the controversy surrounding Dana Schutz’s painting of Emmett Till’s open casket, currently on view at the Whitney Biennial. Schutz, who is white, has been accused by some artists and critics of erasing Till’s image by rendering it in paint, and exploiting black suffering by painting a story that is not her own. And even if Hinkle wanted to render portraits that were grounded in real life, the numbers are just too high. “Sixty-four thousand missing women,” she said, “there is no way I could make a picture of that.” The drawings, then, don’t represent 100 actual missing women, but evoke what it means to be a black body erased. “It’s about this idea they are shrouded in erasure,” Hinkle said. “These cases, we don’t talk about them, or we focus on the killers. But these women, these presences, are more than that.” In her studio, Hinkle lined up pieces of blank, recycled paper. She then turned on music ― Billie Holiday, Sarah Vaughan and Kanye West’s “Life of Pablo” were favorites ― and began to dance. Using India ink and a brush she fashioned from Spanish moss, Hinkle let her intuition guide her as she put marks on paper, dancing figures ― or as she called them, presences ― into being. “I wanted to make this kind of being that is flesh and not flesh,” Hinkle said. “Becoming and unbecoming, defined and not defined. There is this push and pull between both worlds.” The gestural figures that emerged from Hinkle’s body and subconscious mind look like apparitions as much as real people, their trembling bodily outlines giving way to ink-stained abstraction. The black lines veer from fine and airy to coarse and wet, resembling rays of spirit from one angle, bodily scars from another. Some women dance, some braid hair, some curl up in a ball as if cowering in fear. “I wanted there to be this gamut of expressions — joy, pain, love,” Hinkle said. “These imagined movements that can’t be contained.” In his review for The Los Angeles Times, Christopher Knight likened Hinkle’s minimalist style to that of 20th-century Austrian artist Egon Schiele. The mythic woodcut prints of Alison Saar also come to mind, as do the ghostly drawings of Alina Szapocznikow.  Lined up in five rows of 20, the delicate drawings are devastating in their abundance, though they pale in comparison to the number of real women whose bodies have disappeared. “It’s kind of unfathomable,” Hinkle said. “The exhibition is about what I can never really grasp. For every woman there is a family, a mother and a father. For every image there is an infinity of erasure.” On opening night, Hinkle watched as viewers entered the space, stopped short and sighed, as the weight of the work hit them. In the days since, black women have reached out to Hinkle on social media to let them know how much the work affected them. “People have told me about coming to the show and crying in the space,” she said. “That gives me chills because I’ve spent so many nights crying.” “Kenyatta A.C. Hinkle: The Evanesced,” curated by Naima J. Keith, runs at the California African American Museum until June 25.

ARTS & CULTURE,Elena Ferrante’s Beloved Book Series Is Headed To HBO,"Ferrante Fever is spreading. A four-book series set in Naples in the 1970s, about friendship, political tumult and how our memories of childhood shift as we age, will be adapted into an HBO series, The Hollywood Reporter says.  HBO will partner with Italian broadcaster RAI to turn the books ― written originally in Italian and translated into English, among several other languages ― into an eight-part series.  The announcement comes as one of HBO’s first prestigious, woman-centric shows, “Big Little Lies,” winds down, leaving its mark as a critical success.  “My Brilliant Friend” will be set in Naples and filmed in Italian, and co-written by the author herself, who’s notoriously elusive. (Elena Ferrante is her pen name; her true identity was controversially revealed last year.)  It’s possible that the book ― an internal and reflective story, prioritizing personal relationships over a city’s surrounding tumult ― will be tricky to bring to the screen. But, with the author involved, it’s also possible that the show will be as brilliant as the book itself.

ARTS & CULTURE,"How To Buy Art And Resist Hate, Too","Since President Donald Trump’s election, artists and curators have been showing up and putting in work to prove that the line between art and activism is tenuous at best. An upcoming exhibition called “No Borders” is the most recent example. The one-day pop-up show features over 100 works by donated artists including Claes Oldenburg, Robert Longo and Victoria Burge, all of which are priced at $200 or less. All proceeds from the day’s sales will go toward the ACLU and the International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP).  Curator Kirsten Flaherty began organizing the event following the announcement of Trump’s executive order banning immigrants from seven Muslim-majority nations in February. Along with Trump’s ban, Flaherty also sought to resist the racist rhetoric vocalized by the presidential administration’s supporters around the country, as well as the surge of hate crimes and xenophobic threats sweeping the nation.  Two months prior, Flaherty coordinated an art fundraiser to benefit the Standing Rock Medic + Healer Council as well as the Civil Liberties Defense Center, in support of those protesting at Standing Rock. In a single day, the show raised over $5,000.  The “No Borders” exhibition provides a space for the creative community to come together, supporting one another as well as those most targeted by the current administration. “I believe,” Flaherty expressed in a statement, “as do many of the artists involved, that it is the responsibility of artists to use their visual talents in resistance to injustice and these exhibitions strive to raise vital funding while at the same time foster a sense of support among creative individuals in a difficult time.” “No Borders” takes place Sunday, April 2, from 1 p.m. to 6 p.m. at Brooklyn’s Ground Floor Gallery. Art lovers will be hard-pressed to find an easier way to show some love to the organizations fighting to protect the rights of immigrants and refugees in this uncertain time. Also ― paying $200 for a Claes Oldenburg lithograph is just bananas, so you might want to get there early.    Tina Fey, Alec Baldwin, Tom Hanks, Tracy Morgan, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Michael Moore, Padma Lakshmi and a whole host of other stars are teaming up for Stand for Rights: A Benefit for the ACLU. Donate now and join us at 7 p.m. ET on Friday, March 31, on Facebook Live. #standforrights2017 "
ARTS & CULTURE,Publisher Blames 'Russians' For Fake Amazon Listing Of Anti-Trump Book (UPDATE),"UPDATE (March 30): The Guardian reported Thursday that a listing for Timothy Snyder’s On Tyranny was a separate entry for a fake book of the same name. As noted below, the outlet previously stated that the entry for On Tyranny had been changed. The publisher attributed the second, false entry — for a coloring book authored ostensibly by a “Timothy Strauss” — to Russians who wanted to undermine Snyder’s work. Amazon removed the listing for the false coloring book on Wednesday, citing deviation from its guidelines for the fake. PREVIOUSLY: Not long after Donald Trump’s inauguration as president, publishers rushed an anti-totalitarian handbook by Yale historian Timothy Snyder to print. On Tyranny: Twenty Lessons From The Twentieth Century was published by Vintage this month in the U.K., its arrival heralded by an eye-grabbing poster campaign. This week, the book’s Amazon U.K. page was hacked, probably by Russian hackers, according to The Guardian. The miscreants replaced On Tyranny’s cover image and description text with that of... an adult coloring book? That’s right, drink ‘n’ draw lovers: It seems like even hackers have hopped on the coloring trend. The fake description of a fictional coloring book by “Timothy Strauss” urges customers to “color these images and read these lessons to Make World Great Again.” The fake coloring book that took over the page appears to marry Snyder’s name with that of Leo Strauss, a political philosopher whose 1963 discourse On Tyranny explored the possible paths to tyranny and philosophy’s role under such a regime. The cover art of the adult coloring book, appropriately, was taken from an American World War II poster advertising the sale of government bonds to fund the war. “Triumph Over Tyranny!” urges the original poster. According to The Guardian, Snyder is convinced that Russian hackers were behind the tweaks to his book’s Amazon listing. “The idea of making the world great again, the slogan left by the hacker, appears, to my knowledge, only in Russian on pro-Trump posters in the Russian Federation,” he said. A preeminent historian of Central and Eastern Europe, Snyder has previously found himself in conflict with the Russian government. His previous books Bloodlands and Black Earth drew rancor from Russian partisans thanks to his critical analysis of Josef Stalin, and On Tyranny not only critiques Russia’s past and present government, but also its alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. election in aid of Trump. Now, he believes, Russian hackers are interfering with his book in order to protect Trump, who has enjoyed a particularly bad couple of weeks thanks to the embarrassing implosion of his health care bill and the ongoing fiasco of the Congressional hearings on Russian election interference. “Russia has shown a tendency to jump in to help him at such times,” Snyder told The Guardian. Vintage apprised Amazon of the breach by Wednesday morning; after remaining up long enough to utterly ruin our desire to relax through the art of adult coloring, the listing for the instant bestseller has been reverted to the correct image and text.   “All authors must follow our guidelines and those who don’t will be subject to action including potential removal of their account,” an Amazon spokesman told The Huffington Post. “The book in question is no longer available.”  As of Thursday morning, Snyder’s publisher had not responded to a request for comment.

ARTS & CULTURE,What's Really Going On Inside Your Favorite Songs?,"What makes up a song? There are the basic elements: notes, a rhythm, melody, perhaps vocals or instrumentation of some kind. Yet the heart of a song, the inscrutable way it reaches out to listeners, unites strangers, marks a personal or collective era, is a bit harder to get at.  With his podcast “Song Exploder,” musician Hrishikesh Hirway — who also has a podcast devoted to “The West Wing” — helps to fill out the answer. Each episode since the show’s inception in 2014 takes one track from a musician or group’s catalog and allows an artist to break down the song in his or her own words. Who’s been on it? Some bigger names include Solange, Carly Rae Jepsen, U2, Metallica, DJ Shadow, Wilco and Iggy Pop, and the show’s indie-but-well-known roster could rival a Brooklyn resident’s most-played on Spotify: Grimes, Thao & the Get Down Stay Down, Phantogram and tUnE-yArDs. “I wanted the show to demonstrate this idea that there’s so much going on within any song,” Hirway told The Huffington Post last month. “Normally, we hear music and it’s just the finished product. It’s just a little bit opaque; you don’t really know what’s going on or how it got there. But there are so many decisions that come from so many different places, whether it’s inspiration, or accident, or experimentation, and trial and error.” Hirway starts each episode with a brief introduction before stepping back. You can detect the host’s hand in the well-crafted sound production — often, isolated musical elements from a given song will chime in as the artist is verbally deconstructing them. The effect is a bit like the director’s commentary on a DVD, in which you hear about the making of a project from the pros themselves. It’s accessible to both the casual listener and the ultrafan. The idea behind this, Hirway said, was inspired in part by Benjamin Britten’s orchestral pieces designed for children. (If his name doesn’t immediately ring a bell, perhaps the score for “Moonrise Kingdom” will.) “Benjamin Britten had those pieces for children where there were these records where they would explain what the orchestra did, what all the different sounds were, and what they were capable of,” he explained. “And there was something really nice about that. And it’s not condescending at all, it’s just like — OK, here’s what the trombone does.” By having a musician describe the decisions that led to the use of a certain instrument or lyrics, the finer points of a song take on more meaning. The experience Hirway had while listening to Marc Maron’s podcast was another influence: “Those [comedians] he has on his show, I felt like I was immediately stepping in to like, an AP level course on something ... It was intermediate or advanced stories. You were expected to kind of catch up a little bit.” “It felt more real, because they speak to each other like they have this shared vernacular,” he continued. Listening to an artist talk about their work expands our view of their song: it transforms from a whole into a puzzle of finely arranged parts. Instead of the finished product, you consider its influences, the choices made on the way to the finished product. Hirway’s examination of the music allows for a kind of granular, studied appreciation that feels absent in a world where, thanks to digitization, hordes of albums are always available on demand. “There’s something very disposable about music now, and maybe music always, but especially now, where you get five seconds of an mp3 of a track, and if it doesn’t catch your ear, you move onto the next one,” he said. “It’s the flipside of the blessing of having all the music on earth at your fingertips: How do you get through all of that?” The answer, or an answer, seems to be allowing artists to talk about the thing they love. Though Hirway said most interviews are recorded remotely, he was able to sit down in-person with Solange for her episode, where she breaks down “Cranes in the Sky,” off of 2016’s “A Seat at the Table.” “It was especially cool for me because she made my favorite record of last year,” he said. “But really, the best thing about that was how fantastic she was as an interviewee. She really had a really clear sense of her motivation and she had a very clear memory of how the song was made.” He recalled his favorite moment from Solange’s episode, where he asked about a certain part in the song when she sings, “I tried to cry it away,” and the backing vocals — also performed by her — respond, “Don’t you cry, baby.” “She told this story [explaining] how that’s her mom and her two aunties singing to her,” he said. “She had this story about how her mom always gave her and Beyoncé three days. Whatever it was that they were going through, they would get two days to be miserable, and then on the third day, they had to like, wipe the tears away and get back into it. So this little moment, this one line in the song, represented to her this sense of community and family and the idea of picking yourself back up.” “That was so beautiful, and perfectly encapsulated the kind of story and the kind of feeling that I always want from music and that I especially want from artists on the podcast.” Download “Song Exploder” from iTunes, Stitcher or your favorite podcasting platform.

ARTS & CULTURE,#ThanksForTyping Shows Once Again That Women Do The Dirty Work,"Women have been the force behind great men since the beginning of time ― just look at Abigail Adams, Zelda Fitzgerald or Hillary Rodham Clinton. But for every name history remembers, a hundred more will stay forgotten and unnamed. So author Bruce Holsinger is doing his small part to address this injustice, using the hashtag #ThanksforTyping. Holsinger, who wrote The Invention of Fire, is highlighting all the unnamed women who typed their partner’s, husband’s or father’s manuscripts by posting book acknowledgements that credit their achievements on Twitter. Sadly, most of the acknowledgments don’t include a name because, apparently, wives really only existed in reference to their husbands. Some of the anonymous feats are, nonetheless, pretty unbelievable. a quarter of a million words. #ThanksForTyping pic.twitter.com/ZPecTCNVFp Do not disturb Daddy while he is writing his chapters. #ThanksForTyping pic.twitter.com/sR0ImDufFF she rewrote parts#ThanksForTyping pic.twitter.com/M1tsrL8Ohc This wife didn't work that hard on her husband's brilliant magnum opus. Not hard at all. #ThanksForTyping pic.twitter.com/Qs4CJ1FBr0 The tweets describe women in the roles of typists, researchers, editors and, in some cases, practically co-authors. Holsinger’s posts highlight the huge amount of labor women have put into academia, unpaid and uncredited.  Contemporary women are sounding off on Twitter and sharing their own personal stories, with some remarking on the absence of “typing husbands.” #ThanksForTyping To my mom, who watched 4 kids for 2 summers by herself while my dad was away getting his PhD.

ARTS & CULTURE,Bob Dylan Will Finally Accept His Nobel Prize This Weekend,"After skipping the official Nobel Prize ceremony in Sweden last December, Bob Dylan will finally accept his award for literature this weekend.  The singer-songwriter will travel to Sweden this weekend, where he’ll perform two concerts. “The Swedish Academy is very much looking forward to the weekend and will show up at one of the performances,” Nobel spokesperson Sara Danius said in a statement Wednesday. At one of the shows, “The Academy will then hand over Dylan’s Nobel diploma and the Nobel medal, and congratulate him on the Nobel Prize in Literature. The setting will be small and intimate, and no media will be present; only Bob Dylan and members of the Academy will attend, all according to Dylan’s wishes.”  The Grammy winner was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature last October, stirring up plenty of debates in the literary world about whether or not a songwriter deserved the recognition. Dylan himself didn’t acknowledge the honor for nearly two weeks, which a Swedish Academy member called “impolite and arrogant.” Eventually, the folk singer told The Telegraph the win was, “amazing, incredible. Who dreams about something like that?”   Dylan did not attend the official ceremony due to scheduling conflicts, and he has yet to deliver his required lecture (which must be given within six months of receiving the honor). He did, however, provide a “speech of thanks” for the award and plans to give a recorded version of his lecture “at a later date,” according to Rolling Stone. At the ceremony, he was honored with a tribute performance by Patti Smith and a speech from Swedish literary historian and critic Horace Engdahl. At a banquet afterward, U.S. ambassador to Sweden Azita Raji read Dylan’s prepared acceptance statement.

ARTS & CULTURE,A Book About Resisting Tyranny Turns Into An Incredible Public Art Project,"Last month, a slim and timely book ― Timothy Snyder’s On Tyranny: Twenty Lessons from the Twentieth Century ― made The New York Times best-seller list and topped The Washington Post’s. The premise of the book is straightforward: Europe’s failure to recognize and combat tyranny in the past had tragic results that can, at least, provide lessons for the future. Rather than pontificating on this idea, Snyder bullet-points blunt advice. “Anticipatory obedience is a political tragedy,” he begins in the book’s first chapter, before briskly segueing into historical evidence for his claim. In 1938, he writes, Austrian Nazis stole Jewish property and bystanders either partook or looked on, rather than dissenting. To prevent that from happening again, Snyder outlines actionable guidance. Taking his message a step further, Snyder’s publisher worked with a crew of artists who adapted it into posters, which appeared as a public art project in East London on Monday. The book’s entire text is published on a series of posters designed by students at Kingston University ― “as a tool, a provocation and a rallying call,” the publisher said in a statement. They’ll be on view for one week. “Be kind to our language,” one poster reads in big, playful lettering. “Avoid pronouncing the phrases everyone else does,” it continues. The text suggests instead finding new ways to phrase old ideas, to insure that we pause and reflect rather than merely regurgitating powerful, pathos-appealing rhetoric. “Learn from peers in other countries,” another poster reads. “... No country is going to find a solution by itself,” it continues. The posters filter Snyder’s salient advice into palatable sayings, serving as reminders that there’s more to communication than noisy exclamations. Take a look at a few of them below.

ARTS & CULTURE,Artist's 'Trumpbeast' Is A Chilling Portrait Of The Current Administration,"Artist, journalist and illustrator Molly Crabapple called out President Donald Trump’s hypocrisy, absurdity and “soufflé”-like hair long before he ran for president. Now that Trump is the leader of the free world, she has no intention of easing up. Crabapple is known for her fine-line drawings, sometimes punctuated with splashes of watercolor, which swing rabidly between realism and caricature, yielding nightmarish images that feed off the juiciest details from fantasy and reality. If you couldn’t imagine anything more bone-chilling than Trump’s cabinet as is, leave it to Crabapple to help you out by drafting the entire GOP squad as a multi-headed, reptilian beast.  Crabapple posted an image of her horrifying creation, which she dubbed “Trumpbeast,” to Twitter on Monday. The thing features the heads of White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, among others. Their faces appear perched atop coiling, serpentine necks leading back to the same mammalian torso. Trump’s oblong hairdo is pierced by a scepter holding a “Make America Great Again” cap, which I guess the sundry heads have to share.  NYC- does anyone have an outdoor wall they would like me to adorn with a giant wheatpaste of the Trumpbeast? pic.twitter.com/UM4r0aM3jA According to Twitter, Crabapple is currently on the hunt for a blank wall to host a giant wheatpaste of the hungry Trumpbeast. If you know of any local businesses who might want to make a political statement while seriously traumatizing all passersby, let her know. The artist is also selling prints of the image, titled “Make America Squamous Again,” for $100. Ten percent of the proceeds will go toward the Black Alliance for Just Immigration. And for those who are curious, squamous is defined as being “covered with or characterized by scales,” or “relating to, consisting of, or denoting a layer of epithelium that consists of very thin flattened cells.” Don’t google it.  We wish Crabapple luck on finding a home for her malformed monster, though we would also be content to never see this creature ever again. Either way.  We has a new print. A squamous print.

ARTS & CULTURE,'Moonlight' Director Barry Jenkins To Turn Last Year's Biggest Book Into A TV Series,"The movie of 2016 was, according to most standards, “Moonlight,” a gorgeous coming-of-age film that took home (with no small fanfare) the coveted Oscar for Best Picture. The book of 2016, on the other hand, was easily Colson Whitehead’s The Underground Railroad, earning not only Oprah’s stamp of approval but the National Book Award, too. So who better to adapt Whitehead’s critically acclaimed novel than the man behind “Moonlight,” Barry Jenkins? According to Variety, Jenkins will write and direct a TV adaptation of The Underground Railroad, a one-hour drama series currently in development with Amazon. The New York Times reports that the show will be executive produced by Pastel, a company co-founded by Jenkins, and Brad Pitt’s Plan B Entertainment. “Going back to ‘The Intuitionist,’ Colson’s writing has always defied convention, and ‘The Underground Railroad’ is no different,” Jenkins told Variety. “It’s a groundbreaking work that pays respect to our nation’s history while using the form to explore it in a thoughtful and original way. Preserving the sweep and grandeur of a story like this requires bold, innovative thinking and in Amazon we’ve found a partner whose reverence for storytelling and freeness of form is wholly in line with our vision.” Now that it's totally official, I feel okay about spreading the word -- I'm pretty psyched, obviously! https://t.co/tTQjIceu24 The Underground Railroad, described by HuffPost’s Claire Fallon as “an instant classic,” tells a story of the eponymous railroad familiar to students of American history, filtered through the lens of speculative fiction. The book centers on Cora, a young woman enslaved on a Georgia plantation, who descends into a literal subway system in an attempt to escape into freedom. “This book has kept me up at night, had my heart in my throat, almost afraid to turn the next page,” Oprah explained in her review of the book. Adapting Railroad isn’t Jenkins’ first foray into TV. He directed an episode of the upcoming Netflix adaptation of the movie “Dear White People” and an episode of the PBS series “Futurestates.” According to the NYT, the Amazon production has not officially received the green light; it’s been in development for months, but it’s unclear when it will arrive or how many episodes it will span. If it gets the definitive go-ahead, the show will skip Amazon’s typical pilot procedure and move straight to series. It’s pretty safe to say this TV show, if and when it comes to fruition, will be a must-see.

ARTS & CULTURE,"In 1981, Margaret Atwood Made A Stirring Case For Investing In Culture","If only we’d all just listened to Margaret Atwood. The acclaimed author of The Handmaid’s Tale has been acting as something of a political sage recently. Thanks in part to an upcoming, timely Hulu adaptation of her dystopian classic about a woman forced to act as a breeder for a powerful, childless couple, many have found the book’s depiction of a theocratic totalitarian state to be painfully relevant commentary on this political moment. A woman’s right to control her own body isn’t Atwood’s only political hobbyhorse. An interview published by the CBC shows that as far back as 1981, she was arguing powerfully for the primacy of art and culture in defining a nation.  Asked by interviewer Russ Patrick whether “survival of country” is really so strongly linked to the vibrancy of a nation’s culture, she responded philosophically: “Well, what is a country?” She elaborated, ”If you think of Britain in the 19th century, you probably don’t know a lot about statistics on who had bathrooms — although that is interesting. You think of Charles Dickens and you think of George Eliot, do you not? It’s what people made. It’s the expression of the culture that lasts.” Aside from a sudden yen to know a great deal more about toilets in 1850s England, Atwood’s interview leaves us with a poignant lesson about the necessity of fostering great art: Centuries from now, our cultural achievements will be the most important way later generations will remember us. Though her words were given in a Canadian context and have now been recirculated by Canadian media, the relevance to the U.S. right now seems unmistakeable, even pointed. The unusually severe blow President Donald Trump proposed to deal to national arts and culture programs in his budget has prompted many to debate the value of a country funding artistic pursuits at all. When viewed through Atwood’s lens, the answer seems clear: Stimulating the arts and culture sector helps a nation ensure its own historical legacy. The Handmaid’s Tale also, heartbreakingly, made this point; heroine Offred’s narrative is framed by a lecture given by an academic. Many years after her memoir takes place, the all-powerful Republic of Gilead has been reduced to a handful of cultural artifacts, including her self-told story of resistance, mulled over by scholars for their authenticity and enduring meaning. The theocracy’s restrictive, censorious nature didn’t foster a wealth of culture or accurate records; in many ways, Offred had the last laugh on her oppressors by telling a tale that outlasted them. Atwood’s 1981 words in defense of celebrating culture were resurfaced by the CBC in anticipation of the public broadcaster’s battle-of-the-books program Canada Reads. At the time the interview took place, she was several years away from publishing The Handmaid’s Tale, but she did publish a book that year: Bodily Harm, her fifth novel. Safe to say that she has made her own indelible mark in literary history.

ARTS & CULTURE,"Relive Your College Years With This Thoughtful, Hilarious Novel","During the first winter of Selin Karadağ’s undergraduate career at Harvard, she’s walking through campus with her friend Svetlana when she runs into a linguistics classmate. “‘Hey Selin, how’s it going,’ he said. I paused to reply. Svetlana also had to stop walking, and so did the guy. None of us could go until I said something. But I thought and thought, and couldn’t think of what to say.”  Finally, she just continues walking, without ever saying anything. Baffled, Svetlana asks why she never said anything. “I couldn’t think of an answer,” Selin responds. Svetlana stares at her, then points out, “’How’s it going’ isn’t a question. It’s not like he actually cares how it’s going.” “I know,” Selin says. Selin is paralyzed by this revelation, not liberated. “Something basic about language had started to escape me,” she muses. Basic or not, there’s something terrifyingly paradoxical about “How’s it going.” It’s a question, but also not. How do you respond to something that seems to simultaneously demand several responses and no response at all?  I’m 10 years older than Selin is in Elif Batuman’s The Idiot, but this basic aspect of exchanging greetings continues to overwhelm me. When people say “How’s it going” to me in passing, I silently panic or hastily spit out, “Goodhowareyou?” By the time I’ve gotten it out, the other person is usually 10 feet past me already.  Most of the narrative action in The Idiot is purely mental, rising and falling with the internal fits of heartbreak, social anxiety, identity crisis, insecurity and frustration that churn below the surface. Selin, a Turkish-American student, starts at Harvard in the 1990s, unclear on what her next step will be. She signs up for linguistics classes, hoping to understand what language is for and the laws that govern it. She befriends Svetlana, a gregarious Serbian classmate, and Ralph, a handsome pre-med student. She takes Russian, a daily class where her reality blends with the surreality of the bizarre Russian-language stories they study. In Russian class, Selin meets Ivan, a Hungarian mathematics student. He’s a senior and has a girlfriend ― maybe, sort of ― but he and Selin share a mutual fascination that is expressed primarily via email. In late-night missives, the two monologue to each other about free will, their dreams, the “triviality of conversations,” linguistics and computer science and math. She falls painfully in love with the person who writes the emails; he seems to feel the same way, but resists moving further. Asking why he doesn’t want to talk in person, she writes, “I don’t understand why it will trivialize these letters to say hi, or to actually talk to each other. You say you’re not in the mood for insignificant subtleties. But insignificant subtleties are the only difference between something special, and a huge pile of garbage floating through space.” Once initiated, however, their in-person relationship consists of infrequent meetings, stilted conversations and confusion. She signs up to teach English in rural Hungary over the summer break in order to see more of him after he graduates, before he moves out west for graduate school. While there, she mostly teaches English to rural Hungarians, hangs out with her host families, and tries to pick up some Hungarian herself. The thorniness of language only seems more tangled and impenetrable the more she learns about it, and the more she learns of other languages.  For someone who spent four years at a liberal arts college studying language in some form, Selin’s neurotic crises feel vividly familiar. Batuman wittily and wisely captures the tribulations of a shy, cerebral teenager struggling with love, friendship, and whether to take psycholinguistics or philosophy of language. Where many fictional depictions of young women show them exploring their sexuality and navigating romance, Selin is the rare heroine who’s too diffident to act on her sexual feelings toward Ivan, or to even confront him about his ambiguous status with his girlfriend, Eunice.  The story of The Idiot is that things don’t happen. Different forms of Chekhov’s gun appear and disappear from stage ― Selin’s crush on Ivan which is never really consummated, Ivan’s girlfriend whose role in his life never really becomes clear, Svetlana’s odd but unexplained flirtation with her high school friend’s boyfriend. Meanwhile, Selin continues to examine language for meaning, whether the language of Ivan’s emails, her own thoughts, or the Hungarian phrases she learns from her students. This meandering approach to a novel can chafe. Memories of my own college days of nerdy unrequited love and intellectual insecurity make Selin’s story engrossing to me, but for those whose life took a different path, the internal monologue of a Harvard student in the ‘90s might seem precious and trivial. With so little action, much depends on the characters, yet Selin is the only one who seems fully realized by the end of the novel. In large part, the book seems like a series of narrative memoiristic essays, which simply happen to be related by a fictional protagonist.  Fortunately, Batuman’s writing is funny and deadpan, and Selin’s observations tease out many relatable human quandaries surrounding friendship, social niceties and first love. The result: a novel that may not keep readers up late turning pages feverishly, but that will quietly amuse and provoke thought. The Bottom Line: With humor and insight, The Idiot immerses readers in a Harvard student’s thwarted, anxiety-filled freshman year, as she attempts to navigate love, friendship, and the possibilities of language. What other reviewers think: NPR: “The Idiot may not have a point, or a definite meaning that can be extracted and spirited away like the prize in a cereal box, but it is full of subtle, playful insight on communication, language, and the painful process of choosing an identity without falling into scripted roles.” Slate: “The central drama of The Idiot remains a young woman using words to find her way in the world. It is a pleasure to watch Batuman render this process with the wit, sensitivity, and relish of someone who’s successfully emerged on the other side of it.” Who wrote it? Elif Batuman is a staff writer at The New Yorker and the author of a collection of essays titled The Possessed: Adventures with Russian Books and the People Who Read Them. She has won multiple awards, including a Whiting Writers’ Award and a Paris Review Terry Southern Prize for Humor. The Idiot is her first novel.  Who will read it? The Idiot isn’t exactly action-packed. Its prime readership is people who enjoy novels-from-life, memoirs, and meandering, psychologically intimate narratives. Opening lines: “I didn’t know what email was until I got to college. I had heard of email, and knew that in some sense I would ‘have’ it. ‘You’ll be so fancy,’ said my mother’s sister, who had married a computer scientist, ‘sending your e, mails.’ She emphasized the ‘e’ and paused before ‘mail.’” Notable passage: “I wanted to know how it was going to turn out, like flipping ahead in a book. I didn’t even know what kind of story it was, or what kind of role I was supposed to be playing. Which of us was taking it more seriously? Didn’t that have to be me, because I was younger, and also because I was the girl? On the other hand, I thought that there was a way in which I was lighter than he was ― that there was a serious heaviness about him that was foreign to me, and that I rejected.” The IdiotBy Elif BatumanPenguin Press, $27.00Published March 14, 2017   The Bottom Line is a weekly review combining plot description and analysis with fun tidbits about the book."
ARTS & CULTURE,"Seven Years Ago, A Mexican Artist Turned The U.S.-Mexico Border Into A Bridge","“The term ‘political activist’ is problematic,” Mexican artist Minerva Cuevas proclaims in a video for Art 21, premiering on The Huffington Post on Friday. “I think the challenge is to stop using the references to activism, because everyone has this agency to react to daily life and therefore generate political action.” In 2010, Cuevas created “Crossing of the Rio Bravo,” a project that took place near the U.S.-Mexico border. For the work, she operated on a simple premise: “If there is a border, there could be a bridge.” She used rocks found in the riverbed to create a passageway that allowed her to cross from the U.S. to Mexico and back. She marked the rocks with a kind of limestone paint, creating a visibly dotted line across the Rio Bravo. Walking from south to north, she described, is “the most political act you could do.” Near this portion of the Rio Bravo, there were no signs or fences delineating one country from another. Cuevas could spot border patrols in the area, but never once saw an act of violence or conflict like the ones you might see on the evening news. Several years after the imagination of “Crossing,” President Donald Trump announced his plans to construct a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, a project that has been estimated to cost around $22 billion. The executive order tied to the initiative describes the wall as a measure “to prevent illegal immigration, drug and human trafficking, and acts of terrorism.” “You learn about the border through media,” Cuevas explains in the Art 21 video, a part of the organization’s “Exclusive” series, available on YouTube. “Violence is a very strong element in this perception of what’s the border.” “The wall wouldn’t stop immigration,” she adds. “The wall only reinforces this original [idea] that’s connecting the border with violence. In fact, it would empower human trafficking.” Cuevas is one of many artists who’ve engaged in artworks along the U.S.-Mexico border, offering a different kind of lens through which citizens of both countries can view this vital region. Watch “Bridging Borders” above to hear more about the artist’s vision for political action of the future."

ARTS & CULTURE,"Under Trump, Muslim Book Publishers Are Fighting Against Hate","According to the Southern Poverty Law Center ― an organization that tracks hate crimes and promotes tolerance ― there are currently 101 anti-Muslim groups in America, out of 917 total hate groups. According to The New York Times, anti-Muslim hate crimes were already rising in 2015, which saw a 67 percent increase from the previous year. But add to this President Donald Trump’s proposal, initially banning immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S., and religious discrimination seems to be mounting.  While Trump’s travel ban applies the same restrictions to all members of Muslim-majority nations, projecting a message many have viewed as intolerant, Muslim book publishers are aiming to do just the opposite. A recent report on Publisher’s Weekly highlights several Muslim presses working to shed light on the nuances of Islam, and of its practicers.  Reporters Marcia Z. Nelson and Emma Koonse spoke with publishers that issue updated translations of the Quran, books about Islam for non Muslim-readers, academic titles encouraging readers to think critically about religion, children’s books with Muslim protagonists, and YA books bolstering Muslim voices.  Of the diversity of perspectives on offer by these publishers, Publisher’s Weekly writes: Despite the nuances found in the Muslim publishing industry, one common goal between publishers is clear: to provide resources that accurately represent beliefs and experiences of distinct and numerous communities of Muslims in the U.S. and around the globe. The work of promoting a complex vision of Muslim identity isn’t to be shouldered alone by Muslim presses. Another publishing house, Comma Press, vowed to only publish books by authors from the countries affected by the travel ban until it’s fully overturned. “Personally, I’d much rather hear voices from Somalia, Yemen or Iran than have to listen to yet another news report about the new show business that is U.S. politics,” publisher Ra Page told The Huffington Post.  Libraries are also doing their part to provide accurate information about Islam, and to report any hate crimes that may happen within their walls. To this end, the American Library Association started the hashtag #LibrariesRespond.  While a response system is valuable, Muslim presses could offer something that treats the gnarled root of hate: visions of religious identity that are too complex to be stereotyped, and too full of humanity to be ignored.  For a thorough list of Muslim publishers, see Publisher’s Weekly’s profile. "
ARTS & CULTURE,"A White Artist's Painting Of Emmett Till Sparks Protest, Controversy And A Viral Hoax","On Thursday morning, The Huffington Post received an email claiming to be from artist Dana Schutz, requesting that her painting “Open Casket” be removed from the 2017 Whitney Biennial because of the harm it inflicted upon black viewers. The email was soon revealed to be a hoax. Stephen Soba, Director of Communications at the Whitney Museum of American Art, told HuffPost that Schutz was in no way involved with the letter. For a brief period, however, it appeared to offer a long-awaited response to the outpouring of anger, pain and controversy surrounding the painting. Schutz’s painting, on view now at the Whitney, depicts the disfigured face of Emmett Till, a 14-year-old black teenager who was tortured and beaten to death in 1955 for allegedly whistling at a white women ― an allegation his accuser admitted to be false earlier this year. Emmett’s mother, Mamie Till Mobley, insisted Till’s casket be left open during his funeral, so that the racist brutality inflicted upon her son would not go unseen. Photos depicting Till’s battered body and face were published in the magazine “Jet,” becoming a catalyst in the fight for civil rights. The violence inflicted upon Till as a black American is not a thing of the past. “I made this painting in August of 2016 after a summer that felt like a state of emergency,” Schutz explained to Brian Boucher at Artnet News. “[T]here were constant mass shootings, racist rallies filled with hate speech, and an escalating number of camera-phone videos of innocent black men being shot by police. The photograph of Emmett Till felt analogous to the time: what was hidden was now revealed.” The goal of the Whitney Biennial ― the longest-running survey of American art ― has long been “to gauge the state of art in America today.” The 2017 exhibition, co-curated by Mia Locks and Christopher Y. Lew, was imagined amid the chaotic and anxiety-inducing backdrop of the 2016 presidential election. “This biennial arrives at a time rife with racial tensions, economic inequities and polarizing politics,” the curators write in the exhibition’s introductory statement, “inviting us to pause and pose questions in a tumultuous world.” The Biennial was described as “humanist” and “pro-diversity” by New York Times critic Roberta Smith, for its more-inclusive roster of artists compared to years past, as well as its consideration of themes including misogyny, immigration, racism, violence and religion. And yet the most audible conversation surrounding the show has revolved around the museum’s privileged exploitation of black suffering. It has also revolved around a white artist.  On March 17, the day of the Biennial’s opening, a group of protesters gathered around Schutz’s painting in protest, blocking it from view during the museum’s open hours. Artist Parker Bright stood in front of the painting for hours at a time, wearing a shirt that read “No lynch mob” on the front and “Black death spectacle” on the back. As he told The Guardian: “I wanted to confront people with a living, breathing black body.” Shortly thereafter, artist and writer Hannah Black circulated an open letter calling for the work to be removed from view and destroyed. “In brief,” she wrote, “the painting should not be acceptable to anyone who cares or pretends to care about Black people because it is not acceptable for a white person to transmute Black suffering into profit and fun, though the practice has been normalized for a long time.”  Black’s letter ― co-signed by 47 other artists, writers and curators of color ― was widely disseminated via social media and covered by publications including The New York Times and The Guardian. In response to Black’s letter (though without directly addressing its demands), curator Locks defended the decision to display “Open Casket” to The Guardian. “The horrific murder of Till is something we all have to confront, regardless of race,” she said.  On March 21, Rhizome assistant curator Aria Dean responded to Black’s letter (and Locks’ comments) on Facebook. To the idea that all Americans must “confront” Till’s image, she replied: I have already confronted it, and continue to confront it in its many forms ― those where the corpse is Till’s, those where another body takes his place. I already understand these images. We can argue about the power of painting, but I will confidently argue that no white person will look at this painting and feel anything close to what a black person feels when confronted with it. Likewise, I will argue that Dana Schutz’ time spent making it was time spent in the throes of a simulation of the sick, complicated eroticism of white violence against black bodies whether or not she admits it or has even given it thought. Dean, who co-signed Black’s letter, was also disturbed by the idea that, despite the artist and institution’s desire to address white supremacy through the artwork itself, both were less concerned about the pain and trauma of the many people of color speaking out against the work and pleading for its removal.  “We’re again confronted with this ongoing and tiresome problem,” Dean wrote, “where white and non-black people make symbolic gestures toward their supposed dedication to curbing antiblackness [sic] and overtly anti-black violence and refuse to do any work that has material impact on the lives of actual black people in this country.”  Poet Jenny Zhang, who participated in discussions related to the painting on Twitter, articulated her solidarity with Black’s message and echoed Dean in arguing that, whatever the original intention behind the painting, to ignore the suffering it ignited is unacceptable. “If you are a white artist and you create something that black people are telling you has caused harm, you ought to expend your energy, at the very least, on self-reflection, not self-defense,” Zhang wrote to HuffPost in an email. “It’s shameful to do anything less.” Additionally, Zhang, who is Chinese, wrote to the frequency with which black America is bombarded with images of violence and death at the hands of white supremacy. “I can’t even begin to imagine how it would feel if there was a graphic video of an Asian-American person being murdered in public showing up in my news feed every week, every month,” she added, “but that, as Hannah writes, is what black people in America are subjected to.” The Huffington Post’s Zeba Blay offered a similar message in an op-ed Wednesday, describing the painful repercussions of using black pain for white gain. “We see white artists and creators profit off of black trauma, black death, and black bodies time and time again,” she wrote. “We see it in the endless loop of shaky iPhone videos and dashcam clips that replay the deaths of black people like Alton Sterling, Philando Castille and Eric Garner over and over again on 24-hour cable news. We saw it in the photos of lynched black bodies shared as postcards all the way up to the 1960s.” Although such images are often circulated with the intention of spreading knowledge and compassion, they also yield a profit. As Blay put it: “Black trauma drives views and clicks. Black pain translates to dollars, even as we’re told that the spreading of images of black bodies equals awareness, empathy.” In a Facebook post written March 22, writer and curator Legacy Russell continued the conversation, arguing that the painting ― through abstracting and stylizing an image with such a specific political purpose ― is itself an act of erasure, as she put it, of “the equivalent of closing the coffin.” Furthermore, in directing the conversation toward Schutz and her work, Russell argues the entire ordeal erases the voices of Emmett Till, Mamie Till, and the many artists of color whose works in the Whitney are overshadowed.  “We need to be focusing less on Schutz here, and more on Mamie Till, and what her intentions were,” Russell wrote. “This was her baby boy, and seeing him ― and remembering what this violent America did to a 14-year-old boy ― is the thing that we all should be aiming for, not allowing that body to be made lyrical or poetic via the process of being formally abstracted, blurred, erased, forgotten.” A string of comments quickly erupted beneath Russell’s initial message. One dissenter, who, in an email to The Huffington Post, called the painting “a work of genius,” was Art F City editorial director Paddy Johnson. “I think it’s quite legitimate for artists like Hannah Black to be angered over the use of black pain as raw material, though I don’t personally agree with it,” she wrote. “Owning suffering is a very dangerous proposition, because it precludes the possibility not just of empathy but sympathy. Without that, there’s no way to bridge these gaps.” In the conversation that unfolded on Facebook, commenters questioned whether or not Johnson, who is white, has a stake in the Schutz controversy and should be positing her opinion at all. In a similar vein, Black, in her open letter, requested only people of color co-sign her message. The conflict raises questions about whether white individuals’ convictions are welcome or productive in conversations surrounding racial politics their experiences do not reflect.  Artist Kara Walker, a former professor of Schutz’s and the creator of 2014’s hit exhibition “A Subtlety,” offered a veiled yet passionate defense of Schutz’ work in an Instagram posted on Thursday. “Painting ― [sic] and a lot of art often lasts longer than the controversies that greet it,” she wrote. “I say this as a shout to every artist and artwork that gives rise to vocal outrage. Perhaps it too gives rise to deeper inquiries and better art. It can only do this when it is seen.” On March 27, The New York Times’ Roberta Smith penned a piece adding additional historical precedent to the current conflict, citing Walker’s early work as a somewhat similar circumstance. In 1997, she wrote, black artists began a letter-writing campaign against “what they considered the negative stereotypes of blacks” in Walker’s early works, described as “mercilessly Swiftian portrayals of antebellum plantation life.” Of course, Walker is black and Schutz is white, though both were criticized for eroticizing black suffering for aesthetic purposes.  The debate over Schutz’s painting even made its way to “The View.” On March 22, the show’s hosts argued that neither art nor empathy are specific to race, and the painting carries a painful yet important message regardless of who created it. They then discussed white artist Norman Rockwell and writer Mark Twain, whose depictions of black America helped to galvanize the forward progress for civil rights. Host Sara Haines added: “Now you have someone lifting up a story. Does it matter who lifted the story or that the story is being told?” The problem, for many, remains whether the story of Emmett Till needs to be visualized by a white artist to be salient and horrifying. To imply it does, as Dean put it, “stinks of a white savior mentality.” A piece published on March 27 on Hyperallergic by artist, writer and curator Coco Fusco, titled “Censorship, Not the Painting, Must Go: On Dana Schutz’s Image of Emmett Till,” renounced calls to remove and destroy the painting on the grounds that there is a “deeply puritanical and anti-intellectual strain in American culture that expresses itself by putting moral judgment before aesthetic understanding.” We may understand artworks to be indicators of racial, gender, and class privilege — I do, often. But presuming that calls for censorship and destruction constitute a legitimate response to perceived injustice leads us down a very dark path. Hannah Black and company are placing themselves on the wrong side of history, together with Phalangists who burned books, authoritarian regimes that censor culture and imprison artists, and religious fundamentalists who ban artworks in the name of their god. So what should be done? Black and her co-signers demand Schutz’s work be taken down and destroyed, as to never be publicly shown or sold in the future. Zubeida Agha, a pseudonymous member of the art activist group Guerrilla Girls, who goes by the name of a late Pakistani artist, suggested in an email to HuffPost that the Whitney replace Schutz’s work with Black’s open letter. Aletheia Wittman of The Incluseum, a project dedicated to increasing inclusion in museums, shared her thoughts with HuffPost as well. Specifically, Wittman highlighted the difference between freedom of expression ― the ability to create the artwork itself ― and giving it a platform at one of the most prestigious exhibitions in the U.S. Defenders of Schutz’s work have expressed, both on personal blogs and on Twitter, that threatening “Open Casket” is an act of censorship and a limitation of free expression, arguing that even if the subject matter is offensive or wounding, censorship is never the answer. But for Wittman, the central question is not whether the piece was made, but whether and where it was shown. “No one wants to censor art,” she said, “but as with opinions, when we are in the position of picking and choosing which to give space to, not all opinions should be aired and amplified. Space and power has been given to this work as a result of its inclusion in the Biennial and now we hope that trust can be rebuilt.” The fake letter that circulated Wednesday, purported to have been written by Schutz and directed to Locks and Lew, also called for the removal of the work in lieu of the pain it’s caused. Multiple outlets, including The Huffington Post, reported on the letter’s contents, treating the sentiments expressed within as Schutz’s. Hoax aside, the most recent, authenticated information we have regarding Schutz’s feelings about the controversy comes from her interview with Boucher. “The anger surrounding this painting is real and I understand that,” she said. ‘It’s a problematic painting and I knew that getting into it. I do think that it is better to try to engage something extremely uncomfortable, maybe impossible, and fail, than to not respond at all.” As of now, Schutz’s painting still hangs at the Whitney, and Black’s call for its destruction still stands. The artwork, along with the protests and conversations it ignited, certainly raised a variety of “polarizing” issues, as Locks called them, including but not limited to white privilege, the limits of freedom of expression, art world inequality, the exploitation of black bodies, the limits of empathy, and the very purpose of art.  With no closure in sight, perhaps one constructive, though hardly sufficient, course of action, is to take a step away from “Open Casket” and lift up some of the other 62 artworks included in The Biennial, specifically those that illustrate the black experience from the perspectives of artists of color, artists for whom the issue of racism in America is not a horrific revelation to be explored or a creative well to be mined, but a lived reality, day in, day out.  We have repeatedly reached out to the Whitney for an opportunity to speak with Schutz, but our requests have not yet been met.  Aria Dean and Legacy Russell granted permission to have their words, originally written on Facebook, featured in this piece. We have updated this piece to included excerpts from Roberta Smith and Coco Fusco.  Katherine Brooks contributed additional reporting to this piece."
ARTS & CULTURE,The Full 'Handmaid’s Tale' Trailer Is A Dystopian Nightmare And A Call To Action,"“I was asleep before. That’s how we let it happen,” Elisabeth Moss (as Offred) says in the official trailer for Hulu’s “The Handmaid’s Tale,” an update to Margaret Atwood’s dystopian classic, out next month. “When they blamed terrorists and suspended the constitution, we didn’t wake up [...],” her voiceover continues. The trailer shows a montage of familiar images: protestors crowding streets, religious fundamentalists bluntly saying their piece.  Margaret Atwood, the author of the 1985 book that the show is based on, has already drawn comparisons between the beginning of her story and current affairs in America. In a letter distributed by PEN America in January, she cautioned against “dictators of any kind”; this month on Twitter she agreed with a fan who wrote that The Handmaid’s Tale novel doesn’t seem “unrealistic.” Then, the story takes a turn. Abruptly, women are dismissed from their jobs and members of targeted groups try to flee the country on foot. Those women who don’t make it out are assigned as surrogates to couples who aren’t able to conceive, made to wear uniforms, and forced to have sex with certain men.  Whether the show sets out to directly compare its dystopian themes with today’s political climate, for some readers ― and for the story’s author ― the similarities are ripe for picking. Catch the trailer above. “The Handmaid’s Tale” debuts April 26 on Hulu."
ARTS & CULTURE,"Jane Austen Apparently Made Up Two Fake Marriages, For The Lulz","Jane Austen, for many today, is practically synonymous with demure romance and traditional marriage. Documents turned up by the Hampshire County Council, however, suggest she held a more irreverent attitude toward the marital institution. Austen, who never married and died at 41 in 1817, apparently created not one, but two fake marriage announcements for herself, filling out forms meant to document the publication of banns (a public proclamation of an intended marriage, read out on three successive Sundays from a church pulpit). The entries appear in the Steventon parish marriage register for 1755–1812. One entry announces an impending marriage between herself and Henry Frederick Howard Fitzwilliam of London, and the other between herself and Edmund Arthur William Mortimer of Liverpool. In a statement, Hampshire County noted, “Whether or not Fitzwilliam or Mortimer actually existed is a mystery.” It should not be overlooked, however, that Fitzwilliam and Edmund later cropped up as Christian names for two of her iconic romantic heroes, Edmund Bertram (Mansfield Park) and Fitzwilliam Darcy (Pride and Prejudice). Perhaps she had a fondness for those particular monikers.  George Austen, the novelist’s father, was the rector of the parish of Steventon, and accordingly would have been one of the officials in charge of maintaining the marriage registry for the parish. Jane likely had relatively easy access to her father’s papers, allowing her to playfully forge fictitious marriage announcements. “Jane would have been in her teens when she wrote these fake marriage entries,” commented Hampshire County Council’s Executive Member for Culture, Recreation and Countryside, Councillor Andrew Gibson in a statement, “and some could say it reveals a mischievous side during her younger years.” Given the mischief found in her spirited, witty novels, such a quality should hardly be a surprise."
ARTS & CULTURE,Pussy Riot Offers Advice On How To Defy ‘Stupid Ape’ Donald Trump,"When it comes to defiance, Nadya Tolokonnikova of Russian punk band Pussy Riot could be considered a pro. In 2012, Pussy Riot staged a guerilla performance at the Cathedral of Christ the Savior in Moscow. The show mocked Vladimir Putin and the Russian Orthodox Church, which led to Tolokonnikova and fellow bandmate Maria Alekhina receiving a two-year prison sentence. In a March 20 opinion piece that Tolokonnikova wrote for Foreign Policy, she calls President Donald Trump a “stupid ape” and says that at the moment, he should be easy to resist — at least in comparison to Putin. In her column, Tolokonnikova discusses how the U.S. commander-in-chief and Putin are alike, writing that both operate with the same “caveman psychology” and have gained power by harping on people’s fears and anger to make themselves more powerful. But she also argues that Trump is the lesser of two evils because he lacks Putin’s tyrannical force. “When they are angry, they lash out,” she wrote. “For Trump, it is with tweets. Putin has more power, so he puts his enemies in jail. These are just the knee-jerk reactions of children acting out when they feel rejected or scared.” She continues by putting things in perspective. “[Trump] is not a great revolutionary or an arbiter of a movement. He can’t change the country in one day,” she wrote. “He’s just a stupid ape.” But Tolokonnikova doesn’t think we should underestimate Trump, either. “It’s important to remember that, for example, in Russia, for the first year of when Vladimir Putin came to power, everybody was thinking that it will be O.K.,” Tolokonnikova told The New York Times shortly after the Trump won the election. In her Foreign Policy column, Tolokonnikova also stresses that those who resist Trump have to be a “pain in the ass” and “prepare to fight for [change] much longer than you think,” citing how while in jail with Alyokhina, the women would protest whenever possible and went on hunger strikes.  Tolokonnikova admits that these acts of resistance were not easy, but felt her defiance would eventually improve the lives of others and found solace in that.  “Men like Putin and Trump think they can smash people. Putin thought that he could break us,” she wrote in Foreign Policy. “But even in jail we still had our minds, our souls, and our happiness. In the end, we never gave up. And that is how you push back against Trump, Putin, and all those other assholes just like them. We must not give them our fear.”"
ARTS & CULTURE,What Happens If A Nuclear Bomb Goes Off In Manhattan?,"By Kaveh Waddell On a quiet afternoon, two medium-sized nuclear blasts level portions of Manhattan. If this were a movie, hordes of panicked New Yorkers would pour out into the streets, running around and calling out for their loved ones. But reality doesn’t usually line up with Hollywood’s vision of a disaster scene, says William Kennedy, a professor in the Center for Social Complexity at George Mason University. Instead, he expects people would stay in place, follow instructions, and tend to the injured nearby. To come up with a picture of what would really happen, Kennedy and Andrew Crooks, another researcher at the center, are working with a pair of Ph.D. candidates to study the immediate social aftermath of a nuclear blast in an American megacity. RELATED: Think Twice About Escaping Earth to an Exoplanet The Center for Social Complexity was awarded a grant worth more than $450,000 last May to develop a computer model that simulates how as many as 20 million individuals would react in the first 30 days after a nuclear attack in New York City. The grant, which came from the nuclear-focused Defense Threat Reduction Agency, or DTRA, will fund a three-year project. In the simulation, individual “agents” will make decisions and move about the area based on their needs, their surroundings, and their social networks. I spoke with Kennedy about his progress, and the challenges of simulating the aftermath of a disaster in one of the world’s biggest cities. A transcript of our conversation, lightly edited for concision and clarity, follows. Waddell: How will your computer model be able to accurately simulate people’s responses? Kennedy: First, we’re doing basic research to try and identify how we expect people to respond, and how the environment and infrastructure and facilities would respond. When we get verbal descriptions that we are comfortable with, we will represent them more precisely as computer programs. We’ll start with the environment, the weapon and its effects, and then move on to the people, the infrastructure, and their response. We’ve done other models of similar-sized areas, modeling natural disasters and things like that. So we have some infrastructure to support us. We’re using the MASON framework: It’s open source — our computer-science department distributes it and maintains it — and we’ve used it in several projects here. We’ll be bringing in graphical information on New York City and surrounding area, and we’ll model a small nuclear weapon — or possibly multiple small nuclear weapons — going off. They’ll be in the neighborhood of 5 to 10 kilotons: That’s half of Nagasaki/Hiroshima, which was in the 20 kiloton range. The Oklahoma City bomber used 5,000 pounds of TNT, so that’s two and a half tons. That destroyed most of the one building where it blew up, but it affected something like 16 city blocks. Waddell: So we’re talking damage to something like a chunk of Manhattan? Kennedy: Yes, something like that. The number 10 isn’t driven by any particular intelligence, but to put it into perspective, North Korea has done tests in the neighborhood of two kilotons — or maybe as many as five. So we’re talking a relatively small, though still nuclear, weapon. Waddell: What are the social responses you’ll look at? Kennedy: We’re planning to model at the individual level. A megacity is more than 10 million, and in the region we’re talking about, we’ll potentially get to 20 million agents. We’ve found that people seem to be reasonably well behaved and do what they’ve been trained to, or are asked or told to do by local authorities. Reports from 9/11 show that people walked down many tens of flights of stairs, relatively quietly, sometimes carrying each other, to escape buildings. We’re finding those kinds of reports from other disasters as well — except after Hurricane Katrina. There, we have reports that people already didn’t trust the government, and then with the isolation resulting from the flooding, they were actually shooting at people trying to help. Waddell: So is the difference between the two disasters trust and communication? Kennedy: I suspect that’s a large part of it, yes. Waddell: Do you mainly build the verbal models using interviews and reports? Kennedy: We’re reading studies about disasters, and we’re looking back to events like the Halifax munitions explosion of 100 years ago — that was in the kiloton range, and followed immediately by a blizzard — and natural disasters like earthquakes, flooding, and hurricanes. We’re going to have millions of agents, each with characteristics like where the agent lives, where it works, if it’s part of family, where the other members of the family are. That’s the first network that people respond to. But they’re also closely linked to the people they’re working with, or the people who are a part of their new family when they become isolated: the other people going down the stairs at the same time. That community now has a common experience. RELATED: How to Learn New Things as an Adult So we’re going to model individuals responding to the immediate situation around them. They’re trying to leave the area, find food, water, and shelter: basic Maslow-like necessities. DTRA wanted us to look at the reaction, not the recovery. They want to limit it to the first 30 days. Emergency responders will try to respond within minutes, so there will be some response. But no recovery, in the sense that infrastructure and business will start reestablishing normal behaviors. Waddell: So the players will include individuals and rescue agents — who else is involved in the model? Kennedy: When you broaden it more than just the collection of city blocks that are affected, you get into other infrastructure like police departments — not just fire and rescue that respond immediately, but others in the area, local governments, school systems, the utilities that provide food, water, clothing, shelter, etc. It’s a significant undertaking. Where we are is that we have done the basic literature research on how people respond to this kind of a disaster, and we are starting now to collect the geographic information system data — GIS data — on the New York area: the road systems, subway, bus routes, bridges, and things like that. It’s frustrating us a little bit that the publicly available data is not very clean. We’ve found lots of road segments that aren’t connected. We can’t just import somebody else’s map of New York and the surrounding areas and have our agents fleeing the area, so we’re spending some effort in the last several weeks trying to collect and clean up that data so that we can actually use it. Waddell: What are the goals that each individual agent will be balancing? Safety, hunger, family and friends, getting out of the area — how will the model treat those needs? Kennedy: One of the aspects we’ll be modeling is the individual agents’ social networks. Communications with those people, and confirmation of their status, seems to be one of the first urgencies that people feel, after their immediate survival of the event. Part of our modeling challenge is going to be figuring out if a parent would go through a contaminated area to retrieve a child at a daycare or school, putting themselves at risk in the process, because it’s important to them to physically be there with their children. Or do they realize that they’re isolated, that communications aren’t going to be available in the near term, and they only deal with their local folks who are now their family? That’s the sense we get. For a small nuclear weapon, especially a ground burst rather than an air burst, communications will not be as affected as they might be with an airborne electromagnetic pulse weapon. So communications may be available in the not-terribly-distant future from the initial event. Waddell: So your hypothesis is that a parent will tend to the people immediately around them, in hopes that better communication will allow them to get in touch with family later? Kennedy: Yes. And that changes what we expect our model will show from the Hollywood version of a disaster — people running down the streets. For disasters where people are injured, like a nuclear blast, as opposed to threatened with injury, we expect that everybody won’t exit the area en masse, because there will be people who need immediate help. Waddell: And all of this intelligence is coming from research and reports from previous disasters? Kennedy: Yes. Computational social science is not experimental. We don’t terrorize people and see how they behave. Waddell: How do you take these insights from research and build them into a model, so that your agents mimic reality? Kennedy: Through code that implements decisions trees, or needs that need to be fulfilled, for the individual agents in the models themselves. To give you an example from a previous model: We modeled herders and farmers in East Africa for the Office of Naval Research. We developed models of household units that had to make a living. They would make the living based on the terrain fertility, the water availability, and the weather in the local area. So we had a basic household unit that had these capabilities and then its behavior was, in a sense, driven by the environment that it’s in. Here, the environment is a lot more hostile, and we’re going all the way down to the individual level rather than the household level. Waddell: Can you also model psychological effects, like terror? Kennedy: That certainly does affect how people behave. Some people will be frozen and unable to function as a result of terror, as well as their injuries and the environment around them. We will be modeling those effects. But we’re not, per se, modeling the internal states of those individuals. We’re primarily modeling their behavior. Waddell: But to some extent, don’t you need to understand essentially what a person is feeling to try and guess what they’re going to do? Kennedy: We will be modeling people very carefully. The challenge is how precisely we can do that. I sometimes work on modeling individuals using a cognitive model that deals with memory and perception and actions at the near-millisecond level. Here, we probably don’t need a research-level cognitive model of every individual at the millisecond level. We are anticipating modeling people in the five-minute increment for the first several hours, and then expanding those steps, so that we talk about their actions in 15-minute intervals. That’s driven partly by the number of people, and the duration of the study. Waddell: With so many agents and such a long period of time, how much computation power will this require? Kennedy: It’s a lot! We do have significant university resources: We have a couple of clusters of computer systems, which we will probably tax significantly. We’re going to start small and find out how much we need tax them. We may be enlarging those facilities to provide the computation that we need. But to provide some scale, we did modeling for the National Science Foundation on the effects of climate change in Canada and how people might migrate. We were modeling millions of people, moving over the course of 100 years. That would run slowly on a desktop, and to do experiments, we went to the cluster so that we could run different scenarios. We don’t need to go 100 years, but we do need to have more people. We expect it’ll be taxing but within our resources. Waddell: Do you have an estimate of how long a single simulation run might take? Kennedy: I expect a single run may take a couple of days—and that’s at full scale, with all the people. Waddell: Will you be able to make changes to the model while a simulation is running? Kennedy: Not in the sense that you could change agents’ behaviors. But you might realize that because of the setup that you have people are not behaving as you expect. So the modeling of your behavior doesn’t make sense, and you have to go back and reconsider the model. Waddell: It sounds like common sense plays a big role. If you see people acting irrationally, would you stop the scenario to try and figure out what’s going and fix it? Kennedy: It depends on what you mean by irrational. Sometimes, it might be appropriate to have irrational behavior. RELATED: This Article Won’t Change Your Mind What you’re describing about common sense is referred to as “face validity.” If you have a simulation that comes up with something that’s just incredible on its viewing, it’s very hard to convince anybody that that’s reality. Waddell: And how do you separate the actually inaccurate from the surprising but true? Kennedy: There’s a couple of methods. One is that you try to be very careful about the reality of the model as you’re building it. This is sometimes called unit testing: You want small pieces to behave appropriately so that when you assemble them, the overall behavior is credible. You can also, where available, run scenarios that are intended to replicate historical events so that you can compare how your model behaves with the actual, in a sense, natural experiment. I expect we’ll be able to do that. We have a surprising amount of data on how people responded in Nagasaki and Hiroshima. The U.S. occupied Japan immediately afterwards, and photographed, interviewed, and tracked people over a period of time. A lot of that data is available. Waddell: What will your final product look like? Kennedy: It’s interesting how DTRA describes what they want as a result: They told us that they are funding basic research. They’re expecting published papers and academic advancement of students. We are not expected to deliver them a model, or a system they can go play with. Waddell: What’s the timeline going to look like? Kennedy: The funding is for three years, with a possibility of two additional years. We hope to have something running in the three- to six-month time frame that we can use for codifying our practical theories about how people behave. Our basic plan is to have something running and then try to set up experiments, run those, and do the validation and verification, so that we are comfortable starting to report results in a year or so. Waddell: How much of the work will be handled by the existing MASON system, and how much will need to be built from scratch? Kennedy: I would expect that most of what we’re dealing with in this project is doable within the current MASON. It will support very large numbers of agents over very large areas, and their interactions, reasonably responsively. The code is very fast—it is an industrial simulation system. We are exploring whether we should model individuals taking up a square meter of space when they move; we are wrestling with whether we need to model doors for each building or let people leave from anywhere around the block. One of the interesting challenges we’re facing is that we don’t have a lot of data about the height and number of floors of buildings. We have population density, and from that we can extrapolate how many floors are in the buildings and how many people are on each floor, so that we can deal with evacuations. Waddell: How does this simulation compare with others you’ve done on scale? Kennedy: There’s some work at the center that involves modeling the U.S. economy at full scale, which is over 100 million agents. But those are what you might call lighter agents: They are simpler so that we can model them at that scale. They’re individual people, but all they do is their business. They don’t do anything else. This is on the larger side of heavy-agent modeling, on the 20 million agent scale. We’ve been in the 5 to 10 million agent scale before. We can make things easier by modeling different parts of the system separately. When we modeled climate change, for example, the climatologists did their simulation of the environment and provided us with that data, so we didn’t have to spend computer time on those calculations. We could process that sequentially, day after day, for several years. So it’s breaking down the simulation into its parts, which allows us to pre-process them so that they’re easier to deal with in the overall social simulation.

ARTS & CULTURE,Podcasts Are The New Xanax,"By Pamela Druckerman  I’m not an early adopter. I’ll only start wearing new styles of clothing once they’re practically out of date, and I won’t move into a neighborhood until it’s fully saturated with upscale coffee shops. I was the last person I know to download music and to stop paying for long-distance phone calls. Podcasts were different. I took to them instantly, or at least as soon as I noticed them on my computer. Before long, listening to podcasts was almost medicinal. This was partly because I’m an expatriate — an American living in Paris. I didn’t just miss specific people back home, I missed knowing what Americans were doing, thinking, and talking about. After more than a dozen years away, my cultural references were dated, and I often spoke in turn-of-the-century slang.   RELATED: The 50 Best Podcasts of 2016 Movies and TV shows were little help. Most were heavily produced, and usually arrived in France after a lag. But podcasts downloaded everywhere simultaneously. And many were essentially just long, unedited conversations. I could take a bath in Paris while listening to someone in Los Angeles complain about her dating life. Podcasts immersed me in colloquial English and put me back in the American zeitgeist. At first, this seemed like a virtuous habit. Unlike the time sink of binge-watching a TV series, podcasts actually made me more efficient. Practically every dull activity — folding laundry, applying makeup — became tolerable when I did it while listening to a country singer describing his hardscrabble childhood, or a novelist defending her open marriage. Sure, most of my conversations soon consisted of small facts that I’d heard on a previous day’s podcast. But my obsession was educational. I was learning American history by listening to Presidential, which devoted an episode to each president. RELATED: Why So Many Podcasts Are Brought to You by Squarespace And as a mother of three with a full-time job, podcasts gave me the illusion of having a vibrant social life. I was constantly “meeting” new people. My favorite hosts started to seem like friends: I could detect small shifts in their moods, and tell when they were flirting with guests. Unlike actual friendships, which were tinged with jealousy and resentment, these were stress-free. A good podcast conversation was like a dinner party full of fascinating people, but without the risk of saying something stupid and embarrassing myself.   I soon realized that my real-life friends were listening to podcasts too. “Terry sounds a little bored. I think she’s not an animal person,” one emailed me recently, while listening to Fresh Air host Terry Gross interview a wildlife photographer. (Gross perked up once the photographer described how being away at photo shoots affected his marriage.) RELATED: How a True-Crime Podcast Became a Mental-Health Support Group Last summer, I discovered the most important advantage of podcasts over people: You can doze off in the middle of a podcast conversation without offending anyone. The first time this happened, I was listening to a TED Radio Hour podcast about the nature of time, and woke up eight hours later. I’d taken sleeping pills on and off since entering my 40s. But once I started listening to podcasts before bed, I didn’t need the pills anymore. My challenge was finding the right before-bed podcast. It couldn’t have jarring theme music. And it had to be intelligent enough to lift me out of my own thoughts and worries, but not so gripping that it would keep me awake. True-crime series had too much suspense. This American Life was simply too interesting.   I couldn’t fall asleep to podcasts that made me anxious about my social status or had a party-you’re-not-invited-to vibe. The various SlateGabfests were out: They featured female writers in my exact age and demographic, only smarter. The ideal podcast was the adult equivalent of a bedtime story: older people with calm voices, discussing a topic that mildly interested me. Think David Axelrod interviewing Madeleine Albright about her career, or a B-list comedian explaining how she overcame her cocaine addiction. When I found a podcast that worked, I’d listen to it night after night, until I practically knew it by heart. My habit peaked in the months leading up to the U.S. election, when I switched to a roster of political podcasts. I was so anxious about the election, hearing people analyze the news was the only thing that calmed me down. Like all addictions, podcasts helped until they didn’t. I was barely interacting with my husband. And I realized that I’d panic a little when I couldn’t find my favorite headphones, or when it was just me alone, without any voices in my head. Podcasts still lulled me to sleep, but I’d be awake again five hours later, needing to hear another one. And there was something vampiric about devouring a person’s whole life in an 80-minute podcast interview, then moving on to someone else. Increasingly, I retained little of what I heard. I’d spend a gripping half-hour learning about the presidency of Martin Van Buren, but the next day I couldn’t tell you anything about him. Soon after the election, I decided to go cold turkey, at least at night. I switched from podcasts to melatonin. My life felt eerily silent at first, and I had some sleepless nights. Eventually I found that it was enough to insert the earphones, plugged into nothing, before going to sleep. It was the equivalent of carrying around a pack of cigarettes without smoking them. Still, my birthday is coming up, and I’m planning to give myself a special bedtime treat: a sleeping pill and a 40-minute podcast. Just this once, it can’t hurt.   This story originally appeared on TheAtlantic.com.

ARTS & CULTURE,"The Most Clichéd And Most Exclamation-Prone Authors, By The Numbers","The numbers don’t lie: James Patterson loves clichés. He deploys 160 for every 100,000 words he publishes. Yikes! In a new book, Nabokov’s Favorite Word Is Mauve, statistician Ben Blatt runs the numbers on bestselling and classic literature, coming to some startling ― and not-so-startling ― conclusions. In a Publishers Weekly article, Blatt shared a few of the stats from his book, revealing the most, and least, cliché-prone, exclamation-point-heavy, and weather-obsessed authors. “If you have a body of literature, stats can now serve as an x-ray,” he writes. Some of the revelations are hardly surprising. Patterson, who has his name on over 200 novels, many of them bestsellers, isn’t known for his innovative prose. After crosschecking 50 classic and bestselling authors against Christine Ammer’s The Dictionary of Clichés, Blatt found that the crime writer took top prize for most clichés. Certain literary writers known for pushing the style envelope weren’t far behind, however. Kurt Vonnegut, James Joyce (rather surprisingly), and Zadie Smith also deployed well over 100 clichés per 100,000 words. On the low end: Virginia Woolf, Veronica Roth, and Khaled Hosseini.   What about exclamation points? Noir novelist Elmore Leonard hates ‘em (49 per 100,000 words) and James Joyce loves ‘em (1105 per 100,000 words). Interestingly, male writers populate the extremes of Blatt’s body of authors, when it comes to exclamation points. The top users include Tom Wolfe, J.R.R. Tolkien, and Sinclair Lewis, while the bottom users include Ernest Hemingway, John Updike, and Chuck Palahniuk.  Blatt also analyzed how often authors open their books with descriptions of the weather, a scene-setting tactic that, he points out, was slammed by spare stylist Leonard. “The reader is apt to leaf ahead looking for people,” Leonard argued in a 2001 New York Times column. While some authors, like Toni Morrison and Ernest Hemingway, never mention weather in the first sentence, Blatt found that John Steinbeck and Willa Cather both did so about a quarter of the time. And then there’s the all-time champ: “Danielle Steel, known for selling hundreds of millions of books, should also be known for talking about the weather,” he writes. “Nearly half her of introductions involve weather.” These stats might not tell us anything particularly world-shaking about the authors we love, but there’s an inherent fascination about seeing the habits and stylistic patterns of great writers broken down into precise parts. Frankly, we just can’t get enough of it. Check out graphics and more stats from Blatt on Publishers Weekly. "

ARTS & CULTURE,"Nazi-Themed Trump Billboard To Stay Up As Long As He's President, Owner Says","A billboard in Arizona is drawing public outrage after featuring President Donald Trump’s face surrounded by dollar-sign swastikas and nuclear mushroom clouds. The controversial artwork appeared in Phoenix on Friday. In the days since, California-based artist Karen Fiorito says she’s received death threats. “I think a lot of people are feeling this way and I’m just trying to express what I think is on a lot of people’s minds these days,” she told local news operation 12 News. “Something that really concerned us was this idea of a dictatorship where things were going in a certain direction.” The billboard space was provided by the owner, Beatrice Moore, who 12 News reported has offered to showcase the work for the remainder of Trump’s presidency.  On the back of the billboard, there’s another message. It reads “unity” both in English and in sign language. Of course, not everyone is on board with the sign, even those who say they’re fine with an anti-Trump message. “It’s pretty drastic, I thought swastikas were very crude and violent,” neighbor Jeff Whitman told AZ Family.com. He suggested more family-friendly symbols instead. “Maybe put some thumbs down up there around Trump or something but I don’t like waking up to the Nazi signs,” he told Arizona Central. Passerby Astrid Olafsen, however, threw support behind the sign, particularly the front and back contrast. “I think that it’s a wonderful expression of the two sides of the opinions of what is going on and how we can move forward,” she told Arizona Central. Jeremy Bacpac also shared her approval of the imagery.  “It’s fantastic. I think this is what artists are supposed to do, make statements, whether you agree or not, it’s a statement,” she told ABC 15. On Friday, Fiorito posted on Facebook that she expected “death threats and the like” over the work. There appeared to be mixed reviews on her page’s comment section, one calling her a “racist pig” and another thanking her for her “amazing, insightful artwork.”"
ARTS & CULTURE,Acclaimed Poet And Playwright Derek Walcott Dead At 87,"Nobel Prize-winning poet and playwright Derek Walcott, who was celebrated for the lush, evocative poetry he wrote about his native Caribbean, died on Friday at the age of 87.  According to a statement from his son, Walcott died at home in St. Lucia, the Caribbean island nation where the poet was born. A spokesman for his publisher, Farrar, Straus & Giroux, told Reuters that Walcott had been ill and was recently in the hospital.  Walcott always firmly identified as a Caribbean poet, claiming the forms of Anglophone poetry and reworking them to capture the glories of St. Lucia. “The English language is nobody’s special property,” he told the Paris Review in 1985. “It is the property of the imagination: it is the property of the language itself.” A passionate fan of the great English poets, he sought to infuse the poetic tradition with the tendency toward exuberant performativity he found in Caribbean culture. “I come from a place that likes grandeur; it likes large gestures; it is not inhibited by flourish; it is a rhetorical society; it is a society of physical performance; it is a society of style,” he told the Paris Review. “Modesty is not possible in performance in the Caribbean — and that’s wonderful.” He published his first poem at just 14, in a local newspaper; later in his teens, he self-published a collection of poetry. His breakout book, 1962’s In a Green Night, earned him international plaudits. Early fans of his work included Robert Lowell and Robert Graves, and as his career progressed he also became friends with poets such as Seamus Heaney and Joseph Brodsky. In a 1982 Paris Review interview, Brodsky recalled reading Walcott’s 1973 collection, In Another Life, for the first time. “That blew my mind completely. I realized that we have a giant on our hands,” he said. “The critics want to make him a regional poet from the West Indies, and it’s a crime. Because he’s the grandest thing around.” In 1981, Walcott was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship, more commonly known as a “MacArthur Genius Grant.” He published his most sweeping work, a Homeric epic called Omeros, in 1990. The 64-chapter poem loosely draws from The Iliad in a multi-strand contemporary narrative peopled by Caribbean heroes. In 1992, he received the Nobel Prize in Poetry; the Swedish Academy cited his “melodious and sensitive” style, stating, “In him West Indian culture has found its great poet.” Prior to his retirement in 2007, Walcott taught for decades at Boston University, and spent time in New York and Boston as well as St. Lucia. Married and divorced three times, he had three children ― Peter, Elizabeth and Anna. He is survived by his children, grandchildren and his companion of many years, Sigrid Nama. "
ARTS & CULTURE,360-Degree Photographs Invite You Inside America's Most Majestic Libraries,"Whether or not you consider yourself an avid reader, there is something undeniably magical about entering a library. Perhaps it’s the cloak of silence blanketing the space, which amplifies the sound of every flipping page and muffled whisper. Maybe it’s the majestic architecture that transforms the public spaces into literary temples, or the subconscious feeling that an infinite wealth of knowledge is at your fingertips.  If perchance you are not in the immediate vicinity of a hall of books, worry not; Thomas R. Schiff will bring the library to you. The photographer’s series “The Library Exhibition” features a selection of 360-degree, panoramic photographs that mimic the feeling of entering an expansive library space. And the best part is, there’s no library card necessary.  Schiff, who has previously photographed modernist homes and cathedral ceilings with the same panoramic style, captured the image of 38 libraries around the country, from Thomas Jefferson’s Monticello library to the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale. Because Schiff captures the spaces before the libraries open to the public, few people are seen roaming the book-laden halls, allowing the eye to focus on the myriad architectural details and structural differences.  The photographs come together to show the history of the library in America, a space traditionally designated for community and learning. There have been, however, significant changes to the library model over time. For example, prior to the late 18th century, libraries were spaces reserved for the elites; not until Benjamin Franklin opened the first American lending library in 1790 were the spaces open to the public.  Are such ideological shifts evident in the buildings’ stained-glass windows, winding staircases, and looming chandeliers? Take a brief tour through Schiff’s favorite libraries and come to your own conclusion.  Thomas R. Schiff’s “The Library Exhibition” is on view from March 15 until April 20 at Aperture Gallery, New York."
ARTS & CULTURE,Danny DeVito Makes A Monumental Debut On Broadway In The Price!,"If you want to see a fantastic play with an outstanding cast, go see Arthur Miller’s The Price at the American Airlines Theatre. You will experience an impeccable night of poignantly told storytelling that takes place in the family attic of a once great Brownstone home which is about to be demolished, however not before the skeletons  expose their brittle bones to the light.  Two brothers come to terms with their past choices and the price of what it cost them in their lives. Victor Franz is a police officer, who though brilliant, felt that he had a responsibility to keep his father fed after the Great Depression rather than finish his science degree in college, while his brother Walter went to medical school and became a rich doctor. They have not spoken in 28 years and suddenly they’re reunited since the contents of their childhood home are about to be dissolved. Prophetic Gregory Solomon, an 89 year old furniture dealer who hasn’t been active in business in years arrives at the once lavish Franz home to see the haul and decides he will buy everything and make a comeback. This great work directed by Terry Kinney speaks to the family dynamics made of Greek Tragedies. Danny DeVito steals it all in his first Broadway performance. He is totally and completely natural, thus up to the task of authenticating the life of the extraordinary old European Jewish hondler with wisdom, humor and insight into a person who it seems, has not lived one life, but many. DeVito is pure genius channeling Solomon, a fictional character with non-fictional origins, a dinosaur of a time that took some clever and rigorous thinking to live. Mark Ruffalo invariably tugs at our hearts; however I found him far too ordinary and verbally bumble-some to believe he grew up with mammon of once impressive proportions and he actively fenced for sport. Though Victor Franz is a cop, he nonetheless came from a home of wealth with an exceptional education and an IQ to match. He plays his part like a worn out working man completely, with little to no nuances to persuade the audience otherwise.  His wife Esther Franz, Jessica Hecht, does a superb job as his loyal, loving, but often frustrated spouse, who yearns for a more comfortable life above her husband’s pay grade.  Silk suited Tony Shaloub is the absolute epitome of affluence coupled with neurosis. He is expansive and exciting to watch as the story of Walter unfolds and he tries to persuade his brother that he didn’t quite get his father, revealing the truth of a selfish and secretive patriarch. Where one brother is cynical, the other is romantic and true, but each pays a price for their choices. I never once noticed that the play was two and a half hours long with a 15 min intermission. I was completely absorbed in the drama. I will never forget DeVito’s performance and everyone who sees this play undoubtedly will feel the same way. I have always thought I would have loved to be in the theater when Lee J. Cobb played Willy Loman in Death of a Salesman, but I wasn’t alive then, thank- goodness I am for Danny DeVito. I caught a glimpse of greatness. "
ARTS & CULTURE,"Trump's Budget Proposes To Eliminate Arts Agencies, As Many Feared","President Donald Trump’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2018 arrived in the night, and it’s a doozy. Arts advocates have particular reason to be outraged. The National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities are among 19 bodies slated to be defunded entirely under Trump’s proposal, along with the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and the Institute of Museum and Library Services. When reports initially surfaced in January that the NEA and NEH might be targeted for elimination, arts advocates pushed back, noting that the two agencies combined only account for a fraction of 1 percent of the budget while providing irreplaceable support for local arts, culture and education programs around the country. In fiscal year 2015, NEA grants reached every county in the country, many through partnerships. State and local arts organizations partially depend on federal funding to sustain accessible arts programs throughout the country ― not just in major metropolitan areas. The NEA targets roughly half of its grants to programs that will reach underserved communities through arts and literacy education, local theater and performance, and radio and TV broadcasts of arts programming.  Meanwhile, the NEH worked directly and with local agencies to support the preservation of American history and culture, funding projects such as the digitization of the Hellen Keller Archives and the preservation of aging wax cylinder recordings of Native American languages and song. Weeks prior to the release of Trump’s budget proposal, arts advocacy groups scrambled to defend the institutions’ value, not only culturally but economically, as the funding also stimulates the arts marketplace. The NEH supports “humanities work in small towns all around the country,” Stephen Kidd, the executive director of the National Humanities Alliance, told HuffPost in January. Whether the organization is providing crucial funding to local historical societies preserving pockets of American history, ensuring students have access to decades of newspaper articles for research, or helping veterans cope with war trauma through literature, Kidd said, “there really aren’t other funders out there that are supporting that kind of work on that kind of scale.” PEN America director Suzanne Nossel agreed, telling HuffPost that the agencies “fund things that can’t attract for-profit dollars,” ensuring that culturally significant arts organizations aren’t utterly dependent on attracting philanthropic contributions from wealthy donors. Both the NEA and NEH had remained publicly optimistic and refrained from what the agencies termed “speculation” on federal appropriations for 2018.  However, upon the release of the president’s budget proposal, NEA chairman Jane Chu noted in a statement that “[a]s a federal government agency, the NEA cannot engage in advocacy, either directly or indirectly.” Nonetheless, she commented that the institution is “disappointed ... we see our funding actively making a difference with individuals of all ages in thousands of communities, large, small, urban and rural, and in every Congressional District in the nation.” In a separate statement, NEH chairman William D. Adams commented, “We are greatly saddened to learn of this proposal for elimination ... But as an agency of the executive branch, we answer to the President and the Office of Management and Budget.” Though the endowments themselves cannot advocate, advocacy groups are amping up their mobilization. “The elimination of the NEA and the NEH under the proposed federal budget would be a betrayal of the U.S. government’s long history of bipartisan support for innovation in the arts and for groundbreaking research, and could threaten the future of some of the most treasured national institutions,”  PEN America’s Nossel stated Thursday in a press release urging continued action. Approval of a federal budget ultimately falls to Congress, not the president. Though both houses are currently held by the president’s own party, many Republicans in the House and Senate have already voiced discomfort with elements of his proposed budget. And while the NEH and NEA have previously been targeted for elimination by right-wing politicians, they have always enjoyed enough bipartisan support to escape the axe. Advocates now hope that the same will hold true in congressional battles over the final fiscal year 2018 budget. It takes effect Oct. 1."
ARTS & CULTURE,Arts Advocates Denounce Proposed Elimination Of The NEA And NEH,"Since late January, arts organizations have been bracing for President Donald Trump’s administration to target cultural agencies, including the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities, for brutal cuts ― even elimination. On Wednesday, the president’s proposed budget for federal discretionary spending in fiscal year 2018 fulfilled the darkest of these fears, requesting that all federal funding be stripped from the NEA and NEH. The shuttering of these agencies were proposed along with numerous deep cuts to branches such as the Environmental Protection Agency and the State Department. Now, arts and humanities institutions and advocacy groups are redoubling efforts to protect federal arts funding from far-reaching, perhaps even permanent, damage. “The impact here is very severe because these institutions stand to be shuttered entirely,” pointed out PEN America executive director Suzanne Nossel in a phone conversation with The Huffington Post. “When a budget is cut, it can be restored at a later time. When an institution is abolished, it’s not going to come back.” Arlene Goldbard, chief policy wonk at the U.S Department of Arts and Culture (a non-government-affiliated nonprofit), called the cuts “at once shocking and unsurprising” in an email to HuffPost. “For reasons far more symbolic than cost-cutting, [Trump] wants to eliminate the small programs that help us know and understand each other, those that make the constitutional commitment to freedom of expression real, for what does it mean to declare a right without the means to exercise it?” The NEA and NEH being federal agencies, they cannot lobby for their own continued existence, as their respective chairpersons Jane Chu and William D. Adams both emphasized in statements on Thursday. “We must abide by this budget request as this initial stage of the federal budget process gets under way,” Adams stated. “It will be up to Congress over the next several months to determine funding levels for fiscal year 2018.” Both continued to make the case for their value, however. “We see our funding actively making a difference with individuals of all ages in thousands of communities, large, small, urban and rural, and in every Congressional District in the nation,” wrote Chu. In his statement on the NEH, Adams specified a number of projects that the institution provided with crucial support:  Residents in Whitesburg, Kentucky, are preserving the photographs and films of their local Appalachian region through Appalshop cultural center. Veterans returning from war in Iraq and Afghanistan are using their experiences to perform in the Aquila Theatre’s Warrior Chorus. Students, teachers and historians have access to the papers of Founding Father George Washington, which have been carefully preserved and catalogued. Through these projects and thousands of others, the National Endowment for the Humanities has inspired and supported what is best in America. Stephen Kidd, executive director of the National Humanities Alliance (NHA), agreed, arguing that losing funding for the NEH would have wide-ranging consequences ― particularly for underserved communities. “It would deeply affect access to and participation in the humanities programs that help to bridge differences in communities and help to ensure that the cultural heritage of both rural and urban communities around the country is preserved,” he told HuffPost in a phone conversation. “It would undermine the creation of innovative education programs that reach communities around the country, and students at all levels.” While major population centers such as New York City tend to benefit from wealthy patrons and well-established, popular museums, theaters and programs, more rural and impoverished areas may rely more heavily on federal funding to sustain artistic life. “A lot of these resources go to communities that are underprivileged and don’t have entities that can step in” to make up for lost federal arts funding, Nossel told HuffPost. The Washington Post noted on Thursday that, according to the National Assembly of State Arts Agencies (NASAA), “poor and rural communities would be hardest hit” as “[a]bout 25 percent of NEA block-grant funds go to rural communities and 54 percent to low-income areas.” Publishers, artistic institutions and even crowdfunding companies sprang to defend federal arts funding, as well: The arts are not a frill. #SavetheNEA https://t.co/Xt6MEusG6R pic.twitter.com/9AJAirGp4Q EXPAND the NEAEXPAND the NEHEXPAND PBSEXPAND NPREXPAND Planned Parenthoodwe're going the wrong waywe already weren't doing enough And now the fight to save the #NEA and #NEH begins. Let us not forget that what remains of a great society is its arts The Metropolitan Museum of Arts put out a statement on Thursday arguing that the proposal “is shortsighted and does a terrible disservice to the American people. For more than 50 years, these programs have provided, at modest cost, essential support to arts organizations throughout the country — many times sustaining the arts in areas where people do not have access to major institutions like the Metropolitan Museum.” The 11 arts groups that make up New York’s Lincoln Center (including the Metropolitan Opera and the New York Philharmonic) overcame a history of internecine squabbles to sign a joint statement condemning the cuts, according to the New York Times, which notes that the groups only rely on federal funding for a small fraction of their budgets. “The total cost of the NEA is less than one dollar a year for every American,” the statement says. “But because it is so successful and its imprimatur so prestigious, every dollar the NEA contributes leads to nine additional dollars being donated from other sources.”  The Sundance Institute, which was created with the aid of NEA funding in 1981, also released a comment, stating, “Defunding the Endowment undermines our national artistic heritage, and handicaps our future potential.”   On Twitter, other arts professionals and organizations had more colorful words of objection:  The state of the world calls out for poetry to save it.—Lawrence Ferlinghetti#SaveTheNEA @NEAarts @NEHgov https://t.co/UlSIpfePUr pic.twitter.com/pwq2bQzqhO The NEA and NEH (combined) cost less than this fella's federally funded golf weekends in Florida. pic.twitter.com/ZqyDIlcQFV This man out here coming after POC, women, and now art? AM I ALLOWED TO EXIST EVEN? The institutions have been attacked by Republicans before, notably in the mid-90s, when a GOP Congressional majority, led by Newt Gingrich, passed a bill in the House of Representatives to defund the NEA. The bill did not pass the Senate. Past fights, however, typically relied on displays of moral outrage against specific projects funded by the NEA. “Those battles were highly politicized, and there was a lot of focus on the nature of the funding and what kind of projects were being underwritten and if they were worthy,” recalled PEN America’s Nossel. “This much more slash and burn, and no one seems to be concerned with what exactly is being funded … and the worrying thing is that it comes in the context of these Draconian budget proposals.” As Congress will approve the final budget, advocates remain hopeful that widespread support, both within the legislature and within the citizenry at large, will save the NEA and NEH. “We are heartened by the level of bipartisan support that members of Congress have shown for the NEH in recent years and in recent weeks, as well,” Kidd told HuffPost. He and Nossel each cited a February letter sent by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) urging President Trump to continue support for the NEH and NEA. The letter, which was signed by 23 other senators, including Republicans Susan Collins and Shelly Moore Capito, argued that “[f]ederal support for the arts and humanities is essential to our education system, economy, and who we are as a nation.” The battle for the NEA and NEH continues ― and Nossel warned that, with such severe cuts proposed in so many areas of the Trump budget, advocates need to keep their eye on the ball and continue calling their representatives to make the case for arts funding. “The challenge is going to be … ensuring that with all the priorities and areas of funding that have to be saved, that these institutions aren’t lost in the shuffle,” she told HuffPost. “There will probably be some compromises made, and we need to make sure this isn’t one of them.”"
ARTS & CULTURE,Chelsea Clinton To Publish Children's Book Titled 'She Persisted',"Chelsea Clinton was raised by one of American history’s most influential women. Now, she is honoring some of the many other female pioneers who paved the way for women in politics and more. According to Entertainment Weekly, Clinton is slated to release a children’s picture book titled She Persisted, an homage to 13 American women who overcame personal and societal hurdles to achieve their dreams, including Harriet Tubman, Maria Tallchief, Claudette Colvin, Oprah Winfrey and Sonia Sotomayor. The book will be illustrated by Alexandra Boiger. Clinton’s title recalls the now-iconic words used by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) as he attempted to silence Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) while she read Coretta Scott King’s takedown of then–attorney general nominee Jeff Sessions, who was later confirmed, in February. “Sen. Warren was giving a lengthy speech,” McConnell said later, when describing the evening’s events. “She had appeared to violate the rule. She was warned. She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted.”  “Persistence has changed the course of history ― I’m so excited to share stories of girls & women who didn’t take no for answer on May 30!” Clinton wrote on Twitter alongside an image of the book’s cover, featuring three girls occupied by various pursuits.  Persistence has changed the course of history - I'm so excited to share stories of girls & women who didn't take no for answer on May 30th! pic.twitter.com/IMWWou6kBX The phrase “she persisted” has become a rallying cry for women who felt they had been judged, demeaned, silenced or attacked for pursuing their rights ― but who still managed to keep going.  “I wrote this book for everyone who’s ever wanted to speak up but has been told to quiet down, for everyone who’s ever been made to feel less than,” Clinton said in a statement issued by the publisher, Penguin Young Readers. “The 13 women in She Persisted all overcame adversity to help shape our country — sometimes through speaking out, sometimes by staying seated, sometimes by captivating an audience. With this book, I want to send a message to young readers around the country — and the world — that persistence is power.” The book will also feature a cameo by “another important female figure,” according to EW. The suspense is just paralyzing.  She Persisted lands in bookstores May 30. "
ARTS & CULTURE,Ivana Trump Is Writing A 'Non-Partisan' Book About Raising Her Children,"Ivana Trump is set to release a book about “her extraordinary life” and the upbringing of her three children with ex-husband Donald Trump.  In Raising Trump, publisher Gallery Books states, Ivana will recount “the lessons she taught her children” ― Ivanka Trump, Donald Trump Jr and Eric Trump ― “as they were growing up,” particularly the values of “loyalty, honesty, integrity and drive.” The book will be released Sept. 12. Ivana became now-President Trump’s first wife when the couple married in 1977; their divorce was finalized in 1992. Don’t expect her to get too political, though. The publisher explicitly notes that Raising Trump will be “non-partisan.” Ivana’s memoir will focus on motherhood and her children, providing “unfiltered personal stories” about Donald, Eric and Ivanka, with all three adult children set to contribute their personal memories. President Trump, it seems, will be largely excluded from the narrative. “Every day, people ask me how I raised such great kids,” Ivana said in a statement. “They are truly amazed when I tell them that there was no magic to their upbringing. I was a tough and loving mother who taught them the value of a dollar, not to lie, cheat or steal, respect for others and other life lessons.” Ivana’s marriage to Donald Trump was reportedly not without friction; a 1993 book put forth an accusation that he had raped her, a charge she did not fully refute. The marriage ended after Donald Trump’s alleged affair with Marla Maples, who became his second wife and the mother of Tiffany Trump. In 2005, Trump married his third and current wife, Melania, with whom he has one son, Barron. Gallery Books, which will publish the book, is an imprint of recently embattled publishing giant Simon & Schuster dedicated to celebrity memoirs. "
ARTS & CULTURE,Musicians From Countries Affected By Trump’s Travel Ban Fight Back At SXSW,"The day Donald Trump announced his first travel ban, affecting entry into the U.S. from seven Muslim-majority countries, Bassel Almadani made a sign that read, “My Syrian father delivered 3,000 U.S. babies,” and headed to the airport.  The frontman of the soul group Bassel & The Supernaturals comes from a family of immigrants and wants to honor his heritage through both protest and performance. He’s one of eight artists participating in a South by Southwest show organized to represent each of the countries affected by Trump’s ban.  “I can’t forget the fact that I’m a product of Syrian immigrants. My family would not be in the same circumstance if this ban was in place when they were making the moves that they needed to in order to be here,” Almadani told The Huffington Post.  The secret is out! We're officially on @SXSW! Honored to represent #Syria in this incredible showcase featuring artists from the 7 nations targeted by the immigration ban. #MusicUnites . ContraBanned: #MusicUnites at SXSW Friday, 3/17 @ Palm Door on Sixth A post shared by Bassel & The Supernaturals (@basselmusic) on Mar 3, 2017 at 2:39pm PST This isn’t Almadani’s first act of musical protest. In February, he worked with Chicago’s Inner-City Muslim Action Network to organize a show called Refugee Remix. There, he met Libyan-American hip-hop artist Khaled M., who will also perform at SXSW’s Contrabanned show. The lineup was released on March 8, two days after Trump’s revised travel ban was announced.  “Music has always been a medium for celebrating love and unity, but it is also a powerful vehicle for addressing social and political injustice in a way that builds up communities instead of turning them against one another,” the festival’s site reads.  The show was announced shortly after SXSW issued an invitation letter and performance agreement that was criticized as threatening towards immigrants. The festival has since amended its language and issued an apology.  Now, along with a pop duo from Somalia and Canada, three Iranian performers, and artists from  Libya and Iraq, Almadani and his band will play funky soul music from its new album, “Elements,” for attendees in Austin.  “Soul music is effective, when you create that emotional connection to your audience. It creates a personality, especially for an issue that feels so distant for people,” Almadani said. “As someone who was born and raised in the States, and plays a more traditionally American style of music, I feel like I have an ability to have a conversation with a demographic who otherwise maybe isn’t hearing enough of it, or doesn’t have a lot of great resources around this issue.” While many of Almadani’s songs aim to comment on loss, isolation and recovery more broadly, he’s also written songs directly about his relatives in Syria. His song “Lost” is an ode to his cousin, who was killed by crossfire in Syria. “That was a really difficult circumstance for me to wrap my head around,” Almadani said. “Especially because I wasn’t there, or able to contribute to anything. It was hard to find a sense of closure or peace through any of it.” But through his music, he was able to, and he hopes his lyrics resonate with all listeners who have lived through personal loss.   Shades of Gray ▫️ @tystephanodesigns A post shared by F▲▲RROW (@faarrow) on Dec 13, 2016 at 12:53pm PST “Lost” is also the name of a 2016 EP released by Faarrow ― Somalian-Canadian sisters Siham and Iman Hashi, who write soulful pop songs featuring African percussion.  “Because of our story, being former refugees, the entire theme of our EP is an underdog story,” Iman told HuffPost. But the sisters want the whole of their identities ― as immigrants, as women, as emphatic fans of pop greats like Michael Jackson and Whitney Houston ― to be communicated in their songs.  “Our mom was playing pop music since we were born. Michael Jackson was our everything. If we weren’t listening to Somali music, we were listening to pop music,” Siham said.  Although their interest and talent was evident from an early age, the duo was discouraged from pursuing a career in music.  “It really wasn’t a possibility in our minds, because the culture that we come from. We just thought it was something that was never going to happen, it was so out of reach,” Siham said. “We’re the black sheep of the family. We’re the only ones who decided to take the musical, artistic route.” While Siham and Iman avoid overtly political song lyrics ― the band’s upbeat sound is meant to inspire and unite listeners ― their success has provided them with a platform to discuss their politics, and call attention to issues that matter to them, including the drought that is currently ravaging Somalia.  “Everything that’s going on this country, and everything that’s going on in Somalia, it just ― it’s kind of crazy,” Iman said. “What is really the most important thing, to us as humans? We’re preventing people from coming here, that are in such dire situations. And we’re focused on banning them for reasons that aren’t even real. I feel like it’s our duty and responsibility to always talk about it.” In addition to performances by the participating bands, SXSW’s Contabanned showcase will feature a panel discussion centered on the travel ban. The event is organized by Tamizdat, globalFest, and PRI’s The World. "

ARTS & CULTURE,The Sickly Sweet Children's Books That Inspired Henry Darger's Dark Imagination,"Approximately 125 years ago, a child named Henry Darger was born in Chicago. His life was lonely and riddled with pain ― the majority spent working as a janitor, attending mass or working alone in his Chicago apartment. When he died in 1973, he had few companions save for his landlord Nathan Lerner, who, upon clearing out his former tenant’s belongings, made an unusual discovery. Among the possessions of his unassuming lodger, Lerner found thousands of pages of text, disturbing and dreamlike drawings, and one of the longest works of fiction ever made. Darger is now regarded as one of the most exceptional outsider artists of all time. He’s is often described as an “outsider” because he was self-taught, isolated and removed from artistic institutions. It also doesn’t hurt that few details are definitively known about Darger’s life, rendering his violent and visionary works all the more mystifying and retroactively transforming him into a sort of urban legend. In 2000, Intuit ― a nonprofit organization dedicated to the preservation of outsider art ― acquired the contents of Darger’s Lincoln Park apartment, where he lived and worked for 40 years. In 2008, Intuit used these belongings to build an environment meant to mimic Darger’s apartment, thereby offering his fans and skeptics a mediated glimpse into the artist’s world.  In honor of the 125th anniversary of Darger’s birth, Intuit has scheduled a year-long string of exhibits and events focusing on the artist and his work. On view until the end of May is a show called “Source Materials,” featuring clippings of children’s books, comics, cartoons and other documents referenced in Darger’s epic, The Story of the Vivian Girls, in What Is Known as the Realms of the Unreal, of the Glandeco-Angelinian War Storm Caused by the Child Slave Rebellion. This verbose title ― often referred to as The Realms, for short ― hardly hints at the overgrown narration that blossoms across Darger’s 15,145-page tale. It’s a book so long that, according to rumor, no one has ever read it start to finish. What’s more, there is an 8,000-page sequel. The story revolves around the Vivian Girls, seven noble, young princesses hailing from the Catholic and moral land of Angelina, as they battle the Satan-worshipping Glandelinians, an evil empire who practices child slavery and torture. Although the girls are framed as the young heroines, they endure plenty of graphic horrors at the hands of their captors ― including strangulation, crucifixion and disembowelment ― along the way.  “Little girls, from the ages of nine, eight and even younger, were tied down stark naked and a spade full of red-hot live coals laid on their bellies,” one excerpt reads. “Scores upon scores of poor children were cut to pieces, after being strangled to death ... Children were forced to swallow the sliced fragments of dead children’s hearts ... Their protruding tongues were extracted.’’  The fact that the depictions of darling girls being mutilated, tortured and killed appear in the honeyed, retro aesthetic of old-school bedtime books makes them all the more alarming.  The chilling details of Darger’s visuals in The Realms raise a candle to the depths of his imagination. His ambiguities are thought to have mirrored his own inner battles, too ― his simultaneous desire to enact suffering one minute and thwart it the next. Occasionally, Darger inserts himself into the narrative, both as General Darge (a “protector of children”) and as a bloodthirsty Glandelinian. He also drafted two alternate endings: Good prevails in one, evil in the other.  Ambiguity is present, as well, in the very anatomy of Darger’s characters, who include young girls drawn with penises. Myriad hypothesis circle this strange detail. Perhaps Darger wasn’t familiar with female genitalia, or felt torn between male and female himself, as did a character in his other book, Crazy Horse. Whatever the personal motivation for Darger’s choice, it speaks to his interest in illustrating the paradoxical, the two-at-once, the eternal in-between. From the little that is known about Darger’s life, it is clear his relationship with the concept of childhood was intense and fraught. Many art historians account for his obsession with childhood because of the traumas endured in his own. At 4 years old, Darger’s mother died during childbirth and his newborn sister was immediately put up for adoption. At 8, his father, impoverished and ill, relinquished Darger to a home for boys. After lashing out in school, he was committed to the “Asylum for Feeble Minded Children,” a nightmarish, abusive institution that Darger eventually escaped at 17.  After hopping a train back to Chicago, Darger went on to live what, from the outside, resembled a modest, solitary life. His free time, however, was spent furiously transcribing fears and fantasies into wild and sprawling narratives, formed both from images and words.  Because he never went to art school or received technical training, Darger drew heavily from source materials in rendering his picture-perfect girls. He hoarded scraps of imagery that he would trace, copy and collage onto this burgeoning canvases. The resulting works combine the immediately recognizable innocence of sweet storybook illustrations with the fermenting horror of Darger’s carefully inflicted suffering, yielding some of the most difficult-to-digest depictions of all time.  “Source Materials” provides a tour through the unwitting accomplices in Darger’s twisted fantasies. Horns from a ram in a coloring book emerge in dragon-like beasts he called called Blengins. And innocent children, pictured stirring cereal and riding swings, end up splayed and bloodied on Darger’s page.  Perhaps some of the cult fixation on his sources is correlated to the dearth of available information regarding most aspects of his life. The black-and-white coloring book pages serve in place of the family albums, report cards, artist notes and other primary documents we are not privy to. The sugary sweet scraps show the Vivian Girls and their fantastical cohorts in better days, before they got wrapped up in the brilliant nightmares of one lonely janitor.  ""Henry Darger: Source Materials,"" curated by Alison Amick, runs until May 29 at Intuit: The Center for Intuitive and Outsider Art in Chicago. "
ARTS & CULTURE,Man Travels To Historic Art Locations Just To Paint The Patterns On His Shirts,"Two German artists have created a project that will make you burst at the seams. Painter Hank Schmidt in der Beek and photographer Fabian Schubert traveled throughout Europe to visit the spots where Vincent van Gogh, Claude Monet and Paul Cezanne allegedly painted their works. Perhaps you thought they might’ve done so in order to recreate the images of such esteemed artists. Nope. They traveled to each location so that Schubert could photograph Schmidt in der Beek painting the patterns on his shirts and sweaters. The fruits of their labor have been compiled into the hilarious book “Und im Sommer tu ich Malen” (which translates to “And in Summer, I do Painting”), published by Edition Taube. Schubert told The Huffington Post that the duo came up with the off-the-cuff idea in 2009, shortly after they met hiking the Zillertal Alps in Austria. Both had gone on the hike with the intention of creating art, so Schubert just happened to have his medium format camera on hand and Schmidt in der Beek had his canvases and easel. Yet, once Schmidt in der Beek sat down to paint and looked on at the vast landscape, his artistic intuition went in a completely different direction. “Confronted with the immenseness of the mountains and the littleness of Hank’s canvasses, Hank decided to paint what’s nearest to him instead of what’s afield and giant,” Schubert told HuffPost. In other words, he painted the pattern on his shirt, and Schubert captured it with his camera. The results of their first encounter — and a four-week adventure throughout Europe — take the form of an amusing project that celebrates the joy of creating art while poking fun at the pretentiousness of it, as well. And the very fabric of the idea is undeniably funny:"
ARTS & CULTURE,A Bunch Of Artists Made Absolutely Chilling Images Inspired By 'Get Out',"Hopefully by now you’ve seen “Get Out,” the stunningly terrifying social thriller written and directed by Jordan Peele about what happens when a white woman brings her black boyfriend to the suburbs to meet her family for the first time.  But seeing the movie is really only the beginning. There are plenty of clues, symbols, and other difficult-to-detect moments buried throughout the film that are assuredly worth revisiting. Then there are the tweets, the memes, the think pieces, the podcasts, the “dialogues” and, of course, the fan art.  A gallery of artworks inspired by “Get Out” is now on view over on the movie’s website. In one illustration by Sharlene Artsy, black tears stream down Georgina’s face. Sindiso Nyoni’s piece features Chris’ face, rendered in the style of a graphic novel, frozen in horror, along with the words “they treat us like family” at his side. If you are still having nightmares about Bingo boards, porcelain teacups or white feminism, you might want to avert your gaze.  The online gallery is accompanied by a quote from filmmaker Peele: “Art is the one tool we have against the true horrors of the world,” he said. “I hope that ‘Get Out’ is an inclusive experience that inspires people to just talk.” Seeing that Peele’s film recently crossed the $100 million mark at the box office, we’re guessing he got a lot of people talking. Take a look at the wonderfully frightening works below. "
ARTS & CULTURE,9 Parking Garage Designs That Are Works Of Art,"For Architectural Digest, by Eric Allen. Parking garages, arguably the most mundane of all the civic structures, usually skew heavily toward the functional end of the architecture spectrum. There are some, however, that buck the trend with downright artful designs which prompt us to rethink what role these buildings can play in our lives. Parking can be a pleasure when it’s in a Brutalist masterpiece or a space whose facade features paintings of our most beloved novels. AD rounds up a selection of the strangest, most innovative, and most beautiful parking structures around the world by the likes of such luminaries as Herzog & de Meuron, Bertrand Goldberg and more. This 1971 parking garage in London was designed in a Brutalist style by Michael Blampied and Partners for the department store Debenhams on Oxford Street. Completed in 2010, this parking garage in South Beach, Miami was designed to look like a house of cards by Swiss architectural firm Herzog & de Meuron. Known as Marina City, these two iconic scalloped-edge towers by Bertrand Goldberg are residential buildings in Chicago, but the lower sections of each serve as parking for the inhabitants above.

ARTS & CULTURE,Lookups Of 'Complicit' Surge After 'SNL' Sketch Spoofs Ivanka Trump,"”She’s a woman who knows what she wants ― and knows what she’s doing,” murmurs a sensual voiceover to a “Saturday Night Live” parody ad for an Ivanka Trump fragrance. Now, the perfume’s name ― Complicit ― is enjoying a popularity boost familiar to words associated with President Donald Trump: It’s surging in lookups on Merriam-Webster.com, according to the site’s blog. “Complicit” sits atop the current trending list, above “neophyte,” “incredulous,” “refute,” and “recuse.” The “SNL” spoof ad, starring host Scarlett Johansson as Ivanka Trump, promotes a fictional perfume, Complicit, dubbing it “the fragrance for the woman who could stop all this, but won’t.” The voiceover slyly mocks Ivanka’s brand as an empowered woman and feminist, as well as a glamorous socialite. It’s an image, the spot suggests, that juxtaposes poorly with the visible and reportedly influential role she plays in her father’s campaign and administration. It specifically calls out her failure to distance herself from her father’s campaign after the infamous Access Hollywood tape leaked. The tape featured an audio recording of Trump apparently confessing to grabbing women by their genitals without prior consent. “A feminist, an advocate, a champion for women ― but, like, how?” the voiceover purrs at one point. Answers may vary on that front, but one thing is clear: “Complicit” is an adjective meaning “helping to commit a crime or do wrong in some way.” Just so we all know."
ARTS & CULTURE,F. Scott Fitzgerald's Long-Lost Short Story Savages The Publishing Industry,"The publishing industry may currently seem awash in celebrity-penned fantasy novels, short fiction by movie stars and problematic screeds by problematic provocateurs with hefty social media followings ― but a newly published short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald suggests that viewing publishers as greedy and exploitative is nothing new. In “The I.O.U.,” a man relates the saga of a nonfiction work he published. Written by one of his previously successful authors, Dr. Harden, a “psychic-research man,” the new book promises to be even more lucrative thanks to its tear-jerking subject. Harden’s nephew, Cosgrove Harden, had been killed in World War I, and his uncle’s work recounts “his psychic communion through various mediums with this nephew.” The publisher touts Harden’s intellectual bona fides and praises the book’s sensitivity and nobility. His book was neither callous nor credulous. There was a fundamental seriousness underlying his attitude. For example, he had mentioned in his book that a young man named Wilkins had come to his door claiming that the deceased had owed him three dollars and eighty cents. He had asked Dr. Harden to find out what the deceased wanted done about it. This Dr. Harden had steadfastly refused to do. He considered that such a request was comparable to praying to the saints about a lost umbrella. Unfortunately for the businessman, salivating over the sale of “huge crates” that had been shipped “to a thousand points of the literate compass,” a dramatic wrench is thrown into the works. Fitzgerald shows him scrambling to protect his profits, at the expense of editorial integrity. Readers would expect nothing less, of course, given Fitzgerald’s introduction of the man: I would rather bring out a book that had an advance sale of five hundred thousand copies than have discovered Samuel Butler, Theodore Dreiser, and James Branch Cabell in one year. So would you if you were a publisher. (In case we’re not clear, it’s the role of publisher, not the individual man, that is corrupt.) Fitzgerald wrote “The I.O.U.” in 1920, at the age of 23. Originally intended for Harper’s Bazaar, the manuscript wound up back with the author after he requested time to make revisions. He never sent it on for publication. Though the story mocks publishing for mercenary motives, Anne Margaret Daniel, the editor of an upcoming collection of lost Fitzgerald stories, noted that “[s]hort stories were Fitzgerald’s bread and butter,” adding that he “was acutely aware of how much he could make, quickly, with stories.”  Given his famously enormous living expenses, this was probably a wise strategy. Read the full story at The New Yorker."
ARTS & CULTURE,Joan Didion’s New Book Explores The Bubble Of The American South,"“We had misunderstood one another, or we had not,” Joan Didion wrote in a short entry to her book of observations about the South and California, South and West. Written in 1970, the collection was published last week, a testament to the timeliness of its contents.  The chapter is one of the few written while Didion was in Meridian, Mississippi, where she stayed at a Howard Johnson’s and watched children dry off with confederate flag towels. The writer tried and failed to set up meetings with the director of a cosmetology academy and a business college in town; the purpose of the trip was to drive through Southern cities of all sizes, learning more about a region she hadn’t immersed herself in for years.  But, the cosmetology director was shy about visitors ― she told Didion that she “wasn’t interested in any magazines at the present time.” The business school director booked the appointment, but failed to show up. Such reticence about outsiders is a theme in Didion’s notebooks. At an award ceremony for a Mississippi Broadcasters organization, a presenter tells a parable about a bee staying still so as not to be eaten by a cow. The writer observes that the crowd instantly understood the moral, one about docility amid tumult. “It continued to elude me,” she writes. Much eluded Didion on this trip. The tendency for Southerners to speak modestly as a kind of self-defense was a particularly puzzling convention. So the writer, whose approach to storytelling and note taking includes quiet observation, was forced to stand out. She was often carded at bars and restaurants, presumably because her hair was straight and not done up in curls, a less pampered look only younger Southern women wore.  She visits a doctor for an injured rib, worried that her status as a non-Southerner will make the experience awkward. The doctor tells her he lived in the North briefly, and even thought he could stay, but eventually returned to his birthplace. She remembers women she knew in New York, whose Southern upbringings eclipsed their experiences in the city ― no small thing, considering the bustle of the larger place. The South, then, seems to Didion like an alluring mystery, one she never quite figures out.  With her usual avenues into knowing a society and its people blocked off, Didion relied on another of her stalwart techniques: making sense of a place through its weather. In “Los Angeles Notebook,” an essay in Slouching Towards Bethlehem, written five years before her 1970 Southern expedition, she compared the capriciousness of Californians to the surreal Santa Ana winds. Similarly, Didion’s notes on New Orleans focus on the fatalism of its residents, which she connects to the city’s tyrannical heat. “Bananas would rot, and harbor tarantulas. Weather would come and be bad,” she wrote. “The temporality of the place is operatic, childlike, the fatalism that of a culture dominated by wilderness.” Her observations, then ― being those of an outsider ― are poetic and critical, but not thorough or truly meaning-making. Still, the comparisons to modern-day middle America and its desire to protect hierarchical and oppressive values can easily be drawn. An incomplete list of beliefs held by Southerners, according to Didion: marijuana is for hippie trash, wives should seek permission from their husbands in order to take lengthy business trips, a woodcut of Christ and a lighted cosmetic mirror are equally valuable items, demonstrators are unruly, and the press is biased against the South.  The latter two points might strike a chord with modern readers. They resonated with Didion, too, who, upon leaving the South’s Gulf region, wrote, “I had the feeling that I had been too long on the Gulf Coast, that my own sources of information were distant and removed.” The bottom line With an anthropologist’s detachment and precision, Didion took notes on the South that, while lyrical and often funny, do little to empathize with the region. Still, the writer reinforces the paradoxes of Southern warmth, and exposes contradictory beliefs about race and religion. Who wrote it Joan Didion is the author of nine nonfiction books, including Blue Nights and The Year of Magical Thinking. She’s also the author of five novels. She currently lives in New York City. Who will read it Fans of Didion and of narrative nonfiction in general. And, anyone who wants to learn more about America beyond the coasts. What other reviewers think The Washington Post: “At times, the notes are merely disconnected impressions. In one regrettable case, a harangue by a good ol’ boy is presented verbatim for pages. Still, salvation keeps arriving: Sentences — with their detached, reportorial tone, their economy of words, and piercing observations — that are vintage Didion.” Kirkus: “An almost spectral text haunted by a past that never seems distant.”  Opening lines “In New Orleans in June the air is heavy with sex and death, not violent death but death by decay, overripeness, rotting, death by drowning, suffocation, fever of unknown etiology.” Notable passage “The sense of sports being the opiate of the people. In all small towns the high school gymnasium was not only the most resplendent part of the high school but often the most solid structure in town, redbrick, immense, a monument to the hopes of the citizenry.

ARTS & CULTURE,Four Black Artists Join Forces To Purchase Nina Simone's Childhood Home,"The house at 30 East Livingston Street is officially off the market.  Conceptual artist Adam Pendleton, sculptor and painter Rashid Johnson, collagist and filmmaker Ellen Gallagher and painter Julie Mehretu teamed up to purchase the Tryon, North Carolina, home for $95,000. The space is significant because it is where the late iconic soul singer and civil rights activist Eunice Kathleen Waymon, also known as Nina Simone, grew up.  Simone was born in 1933, the sixth child of a handyman and a Methodist minister. She grew up in racially segregated North Carolina, where she took piano lessons and sang in school recitals. She eventually left home to study at Juilliard in New York in 1950.  The house where Simone grew up went on the market in 2016, having been owned by Kevin McIntyre since 2005. McIntyre spent $100,000 restoring the home to its 1930s state, and hoped one day to turn it into a museum and community center. Due to money troubles, however, he was forced to sell it.  “It took me about five seconds to know what I wanted to do,” artist Pendleton told The New York Times, “and I called Rashid and we talked and we knew we wanted to get women artists involved, and it all happened very quickly.” Before seeing the house in person, Pendleton recruited Gallagher and Mehretu and quietly purchased the space.  The four artists who now own the legendary house use disparate media to address questions of race and identity in relation to history and creative expression. “I think for us there was a kind of symbolic value to four artists stepping forward and saying we’re going to support and preserve the legacy of an artist like Nina Simone,” Pendleton told WNYC.  “It gives Nina the notoriety she deserves,” Cindy Viehman, the realtor who sold the house, told The Tryon Daily Bulletin. “The house sold itself because it has its own feeling and history. It’s a preserved piece of history and the buyers have no plans to move it. It’s a tiny house, but if you think about how many people lived it, back in the 1930s, that’s how it was.” The artists don’t yet have concrete plans for the future of the home. Pendleton explained to WNYC that he and the others artists would like to “reactivate the site so it doesn’t become a dead place.”  We look forward to seeing what becomes of Simone’s childhood home, a space with a rich past and a future ripe with potential."
ARTS & CULTURE,"Tondo, Tondo, Tondo","The Tondo or circular format in painting and relief sculpture has been around for centuries. When researched, you will find examples of masterworks by Botticelli and Michelangelo in Renaissance times, to Damien Hirst’s Spin paintings in more recent times, and what will inevitably become clear is the fact that this type has both the staying power and the diversity to meet the aesthetic challenges of any age. What I find particularly demanding, being an artist myself, is how difficult it is to maximize the focused force of a circular composition. Artists are most used to the square or rectangle canvases that can suggest either a portrait or landscape just in the way one uses it. The Tondo is a completely different situation. There is one endless side. And as a format, it has a much more focused configuration that has less to do with incorporating a background and more to do with presenting a subject. For this exhibition at the Walter Wickiser Gallery in NYC, I have selected seven artists who approach the Tondo configuration in new and challenging ways that greatly expand the field. Laurel Garcia Colvin’s What’s a Girl to Do, I Can’t Believe I’m Still Protesting this Shit, Tondo series (2014) focuses her attention of socio-political, feminist related issues that are truly meant to open eyes. Her vision, her agenda and her technical prowess culminate in a potent narrative that will surely force reaction regardless of which side of the aisle you stand on. Created in 2014, her art is more meaningful now than ever, as our nation’s politics and policies are sadly being bent backwards, but hopefully not breaking, under our new administration.  Alexis Duque’s Disk (2015) melds abstraction with representation to create an intricate menagerie of hypnotic forms and hazy functions. Duque’s work is about the multiplicity of thoughts and ideas that somehow coalesce into a working system. But look closely, see every little detail and all the nuance, and you will begin to sense an endless, continual consciousness with no beginning or end. Life, like anything else, is a cycle, and with each generation comes the next learning curve. The only thing that grows is the mountain of debris. Karen Fitzgerald sees the Tondo as a chance to “convey an essence of interconnection, wholeness and metaphysical purpose.” And surely, her intention comes through the moment you see her work as your spirit rises and your thoughts move to a better understanding of the universe as both a micro and macro phenomenon. All natural elements are equally important, and everything is universal in its makeup. One of the things I find most fascinating about Fitzgerald’s work is the focus of her vision through the finesse in her technique.  Renee Magnanti combines bold patterning with a suggestion of spirituality in her distinctive, colorful and highly textured encaustic reliefs. In looking at her work, you will get a sense of both Eastern and Western aesthetics as your eyes travel across seductive iconic forms shaped by cut-away caverns of color. Above all, there is a reverence for design in nature – how it stirs in us an understanding of the timeless powers that are greater than our own, while we are reminded of the uncomplicated splendor of life and culture.  The multi-media Tondi of Creighton Michael express the subconscious connection between human impulse and the language of technology. As we struggle to find a comfort zone with an ever-changing world, a cerebral transformation must occur that may conflict with our instincts. Michael smoothes those transitional moments with a mix of sinuous pours over cryptic patterns balancing them like yin and yang. As a result, this ‘complementary’ pairing forms a universal aesthetic that crosses boundaries, making what was once awkward elevated.  Margaret Roleke’s mixed media work puts a dark spin on the state of the world. She reveals, that from a very early age, we are brainwashed, to some extent, to act and think a certain way through fear tactics and false comfort zones. By combining cute Disney imagery with objects of war and aggression, Roleke reveals how pervasive and long standing this approach to social governing is. I am reminded of a quote by Noam Chomsky: “The United States is unusual among the industrial democracies in the rigidity of the system of ideological control – ‘indoctrination’, we might say – exercised through mass media.”  Zane York’s hyperrealism is both magical and mesmerizing. The intense and relentless detail in his paintings and drawings is softened by a highly perceptive touch while his subjects reveal both their physical and spiritual sides. In some ways, York’s art is more akin to classical, high art, but with an earthier, more naturalistic narrative. At times, he can capture what at first seems near impossible with works like Untitled (2013), where nesting birds see a young woman’s hair and clothes as nesting materials. It is only after a few moments of looking that the scene becomes believable, even normal as its naturalistic detail takes hold of your subconscious. Tondo, Tondo, Tondo opens April 1, 2017. There is an opening reception on Thursday April 6 from 6-8pm, at the Walter Wickiser Gallery located at 210 Eleventh Avenue, Suite 303, New York City. "
ARTS & CULTURE,Strangely Compelling 'Shybot' Roams California Desert Avoiding Humans,"A lone little robot roamed California’s Sonoran Desert for a week this month. Its only mission: Avoiding humans. “Shybot” was part of a weirdly mesmerizing art project in early March. It was designed by the Italian artist Norma Jeane and engineers for the Desert X Biennial, which uses the “canvas” of the Coachella Valley in southern California and its desert landscape. It’s one of several projects ongoing through the end of April. The rover’s camera streamed its experiences back to The Lab art gallery in San Francisco, which presented the work in collaboration with the city’s Italian Cultural Institute. The robot had no practical purpose. It traveled wherever it rolled, though assiduously avoided humans, and was forced to maneuver around obstacles too large for it to climb. Drones tracked its progress from the air — which Shybot at times appeared not to appreciate. If you’re wondering what the point of the project was, whether it’s a comment on machine versus nature, or a study of a land without humans, the artist tried to clarify in a statement, calling it a “fantasy of the desert sublime.” “The machine is let loose in the landscape, free of the human determinism that thus far framed its existence,” Jeane said. “And we, in turn, are free to imagine a world liberated from the indeterminacy of us.”  Got it?"

ARTS & CULTURE,"Robert James Waller, 'Bridges of Madison County' Author, Dead At 77","Robert James Waller, the author best known for his 1992 novel The Bridges of Madison County, has died. He was 77 years old. According to Aaron M. Priest Literary Agency, Waller died either Thursday or early Friday in Texas. Agent Lucy Childs told The Associated Press that she did not know the cause, but was aware that the author had been ill. Waller, born in Rockford, Iowa, in 1939, wrote a series of novels and non-fiction works throughout his life, including The Bridges of Madison County (originally titled Love in Black and White in the U.K.), 1993’s Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend, 1995’s Puerto Vallarta Squeeze, and 2002’s A Thousand Country Roads (the sequel to Bridges).  Bridges and Puerto Vallarta Squeeze were both adapted into films, the former starring Meryl Streep and Clint Eastwood, the latter Harvey Keitel.  Bridges follows an Italian-American woman living in Madison County, Iowa, with her farmer husband in the 1960s. Feeling isolated, she begins a short affair with a photographer from Washington state, who is visiting the area for a National Geographic project on the town’s covered bridges. Though the story reads like an account written by the primary character, Francesca, the tale is fictional.  Critic L.S. Klepp wrote in 1992 of the book: It seems likely to melt all but the most determined cynics. Even those of us who think that romantic love contains more than the usual share of human illusion are willingly floored by it now and then, in literature as in life. Waller reportedly wrote Bridges 11 days and saw it climb to No. 1 on The New York Times best-seller list, on which it stayed for over three years. The novel, which was also adapted into a Broadway musical, inspired many engaged couples to travel to Madison County’s covered bridges to get married. The Huffington Post has reached out to Aaron M. Priest Literary Agency and will update this post accordingly."
ARTS & CULTURE,Dan Rather To Write A Book On 'What Unites Us',"Dan Rather has just announced that he’ll be writing a book of essays on “what patriotism looks like.” It’ll be called What Unites Us. The book will be published by Algonquin and is slated for release this November. The venerated television journalist ― who is currently 85 years old ― has only grown in popularity in recent years, particularly with his recent commentary on President /www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/donald-trump"",""lnid"":""Donald Trump""}}"">Donald Trump. Rather took to Facebook on Thursday to share his thoughts on the essay collection and what he wants it to tell the American people.  “We live in turbulent and disorienting times,” Rather writes. He says he’s been writing the book in conjunction with the “daily (or even minute by minute) news cycle” and has “tried to step back for a wider perspective.” “I want to share my sense of the basic tenets that I see as the foundation of the country I hold so dear. It is patriotism, as I define it, not as a divisive cudgel but a common purpose. It is also a patriotism that will not ignore the sins of our nation, but challenge them honestly and head on. So in the book, I will be exploring themes that I see as fundamental to holding together this great experiment in democracy. It is ‘What Unites Us,’ the title I [sic] given to the book.” Most intriguingly, Rather says he hopes that “some of the spirit we have created here on Facebook” can continue on in his essays. He simply has to finish writing them. You can read his whole message on Facebook below: What Unites Us is currently available for pre-order and will be available wherever books are sold on Nov. 7."
ARTS & CULTURE,J.K. Rowling Shows Two Faces Of Donald Trump On International Women's Day,"To honor International Women’s Day, President Donald Trump tweeted Wednesday about his “tremendous respect for women” and celebrated “the critical role of women here in America & around the world.” I have tremendous respect for women and the many roles they serve that are vital to the fabric of our society and our economy. On International Women's Day, join me in honoring the critical role of women here in America & around the world. Trump’s tweets were simple, elegant and ― dare we say ― presidential. But his polished words definitely weren’t fooling author and feminist J.K. Rowling. Hours after POTUS sent off his International Women’s Day tweets, Rowling fired back at Trump using his own words against him. The “Harry Potter” author quoted Trump’s tweet from that morning along with another, more memorable quote of his. This quote was more candid and appeared to indicate what Trump really thinks of women. “I did try and fuck her. She was married. I moved on her like a bitch,” a black-and-gold poster read, quoting a 2005 recording of Trump during the filming of “Access Hollywood.” “I’m automatically attracted to beautiful. ...  I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. ... I don’t even wait,” read the poster. “And when you’re a star they let you do it. ... Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything.” At the bottom of the poster was a reminder of the stark reality we live in: The quote was attributed to “The President of the United States.” 'I have tremendous respect for women and the many roles they serve that are vital to the fabric of our society & our economy.' Donald Trump pic.twitter.com/JveWBihQFg Rowling wasn’t the only person who called out Trump’s hypocrisy on the women’s day.  The president’s tweet received hundreds of replies from people who pointed out more of his misogynistic behavior, his anti-abortion executive order and the fact that his administration has separated mothers from their families through deportations. @realDonaldTrump Going out on a limb here … you didn't write this one did you? @realDonaldTrump yeah right pic.twitter.com/vzxrWJKt8w"
ARTS & CULTURE,"Artist Updates 'If You See Something, Say Something' Posters With Message Of Resistance","On Thursday, a group of anonymous artists and activists dressed as MTA maintenance workers made some subtle yet powerful adjustments to the “If You See Something, Say Something” advertisements in New York subways.  New Yorkers will immediately recognize the MTA’s iconic, orange campaign posters, which feature photos of “regular New Yorkers” like Gregg T., Jo M. and Officer Chin alongside testimonials that recount their supposed paths to becoming everyday heroes by reporting suspicious behavior from fellow passengers.  The new campaign posters appear almost identical to the originals, but look closer and the testimonials have been changed to reflect the pressing fears stoked by our current political climate.  “I felt like a hero reporting what I saw,” Melissa C.’s quote reads. “But what scares me more than an unattended package is an unattended politician. We have to keep an eye on how our representatives vote and hold them accountable.” “I’m glad I was reminded to report that suspicious bag,” Jo says in her snippet. “But I wonder, when my own president uses a willing media to perpetuate a constant state of fear, who are the real terrorists and who profits off my panic?”  The five replacement ads also feature the hashtag #Resist, and a phone number connecting to the MTA safety line.  “I have no problem with the [original] MTA campaign,” an anonymous artist behind the subway ad remix explained in an interview with Hyperallergic. “It’s smart and it’s responsible — it was a backpack that was involved in the Boston bombing, so we should be on the lookout for suspicious bags, and I didn’t want to take that away from the ads. But to me, a campaign that’s telling you to be vigilant, but just say something when the problem’s already in front of you, is kind of useless. Let’s try to get a little bit more upstream from the problem. Where is the root of this problem?” An artist also told Gothamist that the public intervention was inspired by President Donald Trump’s November victory. In the past few months, minorities in New York have been subject to violence and intimidation, from racist graffiti to bomb threats to fatal shootings. “I’m just more sensitive to every kind of message around me now that’s coming from a government agency,” the artist said. Because the fake ads are technically illegal, the artists involved have elected to remain anonymous, a Gothamist reporter told The Huffington Post. And, in an effort to keep the posters circulating as long as possible, they ask the public not to disclose which subway lines they are on.  New Yorkers, on your next Subway commute, be vigilant. Both in terms of the safety of your fellow commuters and the potential for compelling activist art. "
ARTS & CULTURE,74-Year-Old Man Arrested After Alleged 'Massacre' Of Kim Kardashian’s Books,"In an act as inscrutable as Kim Kardashian’s initial rise to fame, a 74-year-old man was arrested after allegedly destroying several of the celebrity’s books, BuzzFeed News reports.  Six copies of Selfish, Kardashian’s art book released by Rizzoli and recently updated with further selfies, were tarnished with a red liquid. According to the Glastonbury Police Department, the scene was accompanied by a note from the man, “explaining his dislike of Ms. Kardashian and people like her.” Kardashian’s book was not only a commercial success, but a critical one, too. Art critic Jerry Saltz compared the author’s mass-produced work to Andy Warhol’s, describing her as “a first adapter and partial inventor of a genre” ― that genre being selfies. The book’s publisher echoes this sentiment, writing on its site, “Kim has mastered the art of taking flattering and highly personal photos of oneself.” Selfish is priced at $19.99; the book’s alleged destroyer was released on a $2,500 non-surety bond, after being charged with Criminal Mischief. "
ARTS & CULTURE,Alvin Ailey Introduces New Works; We Love Accordingly,"Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater returns to Southern California delivering magnificent works and debuting exciting new pieces. The revolutionary modern dance company has been a force in the dance community for decades. Ailey began his career during the civil rights era in the 50’s when opportunities were extremely limited for African American dancers. His goal was to spawn a company that granted African American dancers a chance to perform and express themselves, their cultures, and experiences. Fast forward many years later to when he created one of the first professional companies where diverse dancers were welcomed and highlighted.  The Music Center hosts the Ailey Company for a dynamic week of performances from this incredible company.  Kicking off the evening was the stunning and vibrant new piece titled r-Evolution, Dream. A piece comprised of several excerpts from dynamic poems about identity and self worth speaks to the struggles of marginalized groups in America. Recordings from works such as The Negro’s Complaints and the constant presence of Martin Luther King Jr., delivers a striking message about being black in America and the movement doesn’t disappoint on that front either. Choreographed by veteran member of Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, Hope Boykin, r-Evolution, Dream is a beautiful combination of strong staccato movements intertwined with elongated powerful phrasing that makes for a dazzling display of dance. The show only gets better from here. Untitled America, choreographed by Kyle Abraham, was a show stopper that explores the negative effects that the American prison system has on families. This piece transcends race and time and provides relevant and poignant commentary on the status quo in this country. After that heavy piece of art, audiences will be able to have a bit of fun with the spunky and lively piece, Ella, choreographed by Robert Battle who happens to be the Artistic Director of the company. My knees are still hurting for the two formidable dancers in that piece. (You will have to see the show to know why.) The bread and butter of the Ailey repertoire is the piece, Revelations. This soul stirring collection of pieces set to remastered Negro Spirituals and blues will send you into a cultural revival. Produced by Alvin Ailey Dance Theater in 1960, Revelations takes viewers on a journey navigating African-American vigor, struggle, and faith during the transition from slavery to the path of freedom.   Tickets for Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater performances at The Music Center start at $34 and are available online on The Music Center website; at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion Box Office, 135 N Grand Ave, Los Angeles, CA, 90012; or by calling (213( 972-0711. For groups of 10 or more, call (213) 972-8555 or email mcgroupsales@musiccenter.org. "
ARTS & CULTURE,A 'Real' School Of Wizardry Is Opening In An English Castle This Year,"For all the young readers who waited in anticipation for a letter of acceptance to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, hopeful in spite of an awareness that it would probably never show, that dream ― or a version of it, anyway ― can now be realized. The Bothwell School of Witchcraft is a weekend-long event in Herstmonceux Castle in East Sussex, England, complete with a moat and surrounding woodland. There won’t be a giant, hairy groundskeeper there to greet attendees, though. The creators of the Bothwell School are clear on their site that the getaway isn’t legally allowed to feature Harry Potter characters. “However this means The Bothwell School of Witchcraft is set in an entirely different universe and time with entirely new characters and new plots!” the site’s FAQ section reads, protesting too much, perhaps.  The school’s four houses are reminiscent of Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling’s, featuring green-and-silver and purple-and-gold color schemes. The Bothwell event will be like an extended dinner theatre, with character roles determined based on pre-distributed questionnaires. Robes and ties will be provided, but the event is BYOW (bring your own wand). The Bothwell School of Witchcraft isn’t the first attempt that fans or enterprising individuals have made to bring the world of Harry Potter to life. The organization has partnered with College of Wizardry and New World Magischola, related roleplaying weekends. Harry Potter cosplay is among the most practiced at Comic-Con. Last year in San Diego, even less beloved minor characters like Dolores Umbridge were performed by attendees.  For fans willing to pay £400 to £450, tickets to Bothwell will soon be available on Kickstarter. In the meantime, there’s always that creative space ripe for exploring: your imagination."
ARTS & CULTURE,"Margaret Atwood's Advice For Young Feminists: 'Be Informed, Be Aware'","It’s an International Women’s Day miracle! Margaret Atwood, author of the classic feminist dystopia The Handmaid’s Tale, took to the internet today bearing gifts: A new teaser for the Hulu series adaptation of the book, a takeover of the series’ Instagram account, and a Reddit AMA bursting with feminist inspiration.  Over the course of her AMA, the speculative fiction doyenne offered Reddit users insights about her work, the upcoming “Handmaid’s Tale” series, and the feminist struggle. A major topic of discussion was the dystopian novel ― timely due to both its soon-to-be-released TV version and the timeliness of the book’s events. The Handmaid’s Tale takes place in a future North America in which a theocratic regime has seized power and dramatically rolled back women’s rights.   April 1984, starting to type The Handmaid’s Tale in West Berlin. — Margaret Atwood #HandmaidsTale A post shared by The Handmaid's Tale (@handmaidsonhulu) on Mar 8, 2017 at 9:32am PST Here are some of the big takeaways: In one response, Atwood encouraged young women to be politically engaged ― a fitting message from the author of a book that’s had such a profound impact on many feminists today. “Be informed, be aware,” she wrote, urging feminists to try “to prevent the roll-back that is taking place especially in the area of women’s health. Who knew that this would ever have to be defended? Childbirth care, pre-natal care, early childhood care ― many people will not even be able to afford any of it.” If these healthcare battles were to be lost, Atwood was clear that the damage would be severe: “Dead bodies on the floor will result.” “There is the whole issue of sexual violence being used as control ― it is such an old motif.” She suggested one concrete, practical step for women to take immediately: “If I were a younger woman I’d be taking a self-defense course,” she advised. “It’s an unsettled time.” When one Reddit user went so far as to posit that the U.S. “is basically on the road to becoming Gilead” (the theocratic, patriarchal totalitarian state in The Handmaid’s Tale), Atwood didn’t disagree. “I cannot tell you how strange this feels,” she admitted. “I wrote the book hoping to fend it off, and I believe it will be fended off: America is very diverse, a lot of people have been jolted out of political slumber and are paying attention, and the Constitution still stands.” Comparing the 2017 screen adaptation of the novel to a 1990 film version, she noted that times had changed: “That world is closer now! [...] then, many people were saying, ‘It can’t happen here.’ Now, not so much.” During the AMA, she had high praise for the Hulu series, which she helped write and on which she’s credited as a consulting producer. “It goes farther than I did in the book,” she revealed.  How exactly does it go farther? Let’s just say: We can’t wait to find out."

ARTS & CULTURE,"These Are The Realities Of Mental Health, From A(nxiety) To Z","A is for anxiety, which itself comes in many shapes and colors. B is for bipolar disorder, a term still ignorantly used to describe mood swings or temper tantrums. C is for Cotard delusion, a term for a condition that leads an individual to believe he or she is already dead or does not exist.  These are the ABCs of mental illness, thoughtfully compiled and illustrated by India-based writer, illustrator and graphic designer Sonaksha Iyengar.  Iyengar began the series as part of 36 Days of Type, a project challenging designers and illustrators to create their own takes on the letters and numbers of the alphabet, all of which respond to a singular theme. Iyengar, who has struggled with her mental health in the past, decided to focus her alphabet-based works around the still-stigmatized subject.  Bipolar disorder is NOT another way to describe a mood swing or a temper tantrum. So please don't. #atozofmentalhealth - - - - - #365daysofart #drawingaday #36daysoftype @36daysoftype #36days_B #36daysoftype04 #mentalhealth #art #typography #lettering #colors #bipolar #bipolardisorder #watercolor #igart #sketchbook #digitalart #illustration #selflove #care #mentalhealthawareness #endthestigma A post shared by Sonaksha Iyengar (@sonaksha) on Feb 22, 2017 at 7:34am PST Every day, the artist uploads a new image to Instagram focused on a specific condition and its first letter. The images, depicting states ranging from jealousy to insomnia, reveal how mental health struggles touch all lives, and are not always tethered to a diagnosed condition. Iyengar has taken some liberties with the disorders and behaviors she’s chosen to illustrate ― for example, Cotard delusion, or Cotard’s syndrome, is not recognized in the American Psychiatric Association’s DSM-V and only extreme jealousy might be considered a mental illness ― but the underlying message remains steady: She aims to spotlight illnesses and symptoms that are often overlooked or under-recognized. Iyengar hopes her imagery, rendered in dreamy pastels seemingly plucked straight from the subconscious, encourage open and generous discussions on the subject matter. “‘Get over it’ is not how it works,” the artist told BuzzFeed, “and I think being more aware and acknowledging mental health will help us make a start in the direction towards kindness and empathy.” “It is time to have honest conversations with each other about the importance of mental health,” she concluded. Immerse yourself in the conversation with Iyengar’s works below, and follow her on Instagram for more.   Imagine living every single day convinced that you're dead.

First, it's wrong to make a generalized assumption. Second, a personality disorder like Histrionic Personality Disorder often goes undetected because the person can have great social skills. People with HPD tend to love being the center of attention, and sometimes this leads to failure and disappointment. However, like any other mental health issue, the treatment is not to yell or curse, but to give them time and guide them to seek help. But, it's also important to remember that anyone who enjoys attention doesn't have HPD. Always go to a trained medical professional for diagnosis. There's more to it that meets the eye. #atozofmentalhealth - - - - - #365daysofart #drawingaday #36daysoftype @36daysoftype #36days_H #36daysoftype04 #mentalhealth #art #typography #lettering #personalitydisorder #attention #watercolor #igart #sketchbook #digitalart #illustration #selflove #care #mentalhealthawareness #endthestigma #histrionicpersonalitydisorder A post shared by Sonaksha Iyengar (@sonaksha) on Feb 28, 2017 at 7:09am PST  Choosing not to sleep does not make you cool, nor does it make you an insomniac.

While it is often confused for envy, the two are really different. Jealousy often seeps into the head when there's a threat to a relationship - romantic, platonic and familial among others. Envy is about desiring what the other has. While it is normal to feel jealous, it's important to discuss it and find ways to deal with it rather than allow it to collect and erupt in pathological or delusional ways. Talk about it, with someone you trust whether it's a friend or a therapist.  #atozofmentalhealth - - - - - #365daysofart #drawingaday #36daysoftype @36daysoftype #36days_J #36daysoftype04 #mentalhealth #art #typography #lettering #jealous #anger #frustration #watercolor #igart #sketchbook #digitalart #illustration #selflove #care #mentalhealthawareness #endthestigma #love #relationships #brain A post shared by Sonaksha Iyengar (@sonaksha) on Mar 2, 2017 at 8:34am PST  It's easy to say you have kleptomania and justify thievery but that's not true.

ARTS & CULTURE,How 'Jane The Virgin' Gets Motherhood Right,"For all its unexpected plot twists, “Jane the Virgin” is a show that’s consistent in its honest and progressive portrayal of strong women. Not only the titular Jane, but her mother, Xiomara, her grandmother, Alba, and Petra, the mother of her son’s half-siblings. (See? Plot twists.)  In the first season of “Jane,” Petra’s cast as the villain, the ambitious ex-wife of Raphael, the man Jane’s having a baby with. She’s a sharp dresser with business acumen and great hair. But she’s more than all that; she’s also lovelorn. As actress Yael Grobglas explained of her character in an interview with The Huffington Post, “she’s not just doing evil to do evil.” The show uses Petra to explore issues like thorny pregnancy and postpartum depression.  “Every time I’ve tried to predict what’s on the show, and I consider myself a pretty creative person, I’ve always been wrong,” Grobglas said. With “down-to-earth characters mixed with huge, telenovela moments,” there’s plenty of room for the characters to learn and grow. This way, they don’t fall into cliche; heroes are never just heroes, mothers are never just mothers, and villains are never just villains.  Below, Grobglas talks about playing a mother on screen, and ― oh yeah ― the show’s bold three-year jump. What first interested you about the role of Petra? When I first heard about the role of Petra, I didn’t know what was going to happen with her, I had no idea. I knew she was going to be the villain. I was a little hesitant about taking the role of a villain that could potentially go for ― if you’re lucky ― seven years, 10 years. And then I got on the phone with [showrunner] Jennie Urman, who told me Petra was never going to be two-dimensional, she would always be very complex, she’d be hated one moment and loved the next. She’s really been so wonderful about keeping up with that. I would have never expected everything with Petra to happen. Speaking of unexpected turns, last season you were given an extra part on the show, as Petra’s twin sister, Anezka.  I had no idea that was happening. I got the script, like we usually do, one or two days before we started filming, and I read that Petra was disguising herself and getting ready to run away. I thought it was because of her postpartum depression, and I was getting a little worried, because my first go-to thought is that I’m going to get killed off. I think that about everything. And then Anezka shows up at the end of the episode, and suddenly there’s two of me.  For a week beforehand, people who got the script before me were kind of trying to be nonchalant, going, “So, uh, did you read next episode?” And I was like, “No, Jesus, why?”  So I spoke to Jennie and she described her to me, and I was like, what is this character, what is she about? And she spoke about the accent, and she spoke about being a ferocious eater, and having personal space issues, and scratching people, and jumping backwards ― I call it “getting the fear” ― and immediately thought, I know somebody like that. I based her off my cat. And that’s how Anezka came to be. Is it difficult to toggle between those two very different parts, or is it mostly just exciting? I have so much more appreciation for people who do this long-term. I never thought about it, but as an actor I depend so much on my costars, and when you’re doing scenes with yourself, you have nobody to play off. You have to come so well-prepared, and predict what you’re going to do.  You touched on this a little already but both Petra and Anezka could be described as the show’s sympathetic villains. How do you approach playing a villain without making her seem purely evil? I think the most important thing is really in the writing. The way Jennie explained it to me when we had our first conversation was that Petra was the hero of her own story. She really started the show at her most desperate point, she’s in love with someone and he’s leaving her. But she decides to have herself inseminated, and that goes horribly wrong, obviously. So most of her actions, as crazy as they may seem, are justified, to her. It’s not that much of a challenge for me, with such great writing.  She’s not just doing evil to do evil. And if you think about it, most of the crazy stuff she’s done is actually kind of selfless. It’s been to help her mother, or to protect her daughters, protect Raphael. You mentioned her daughters ― this season we get to see another side of Petra, that of a confident and loving mother. How do you think motherhood fits in with everything else we know about Petra? I think it’s been so fascinating, because the show manages to capture so many different aspects of what it is to be a mother. Everything went one way for Jane, and then Petra was a way to show a very different approach to motherhood. From the beginning, Jane’s birthing scene and Petra’s birthing scene couldn’t have been more opposite, and then she struggled with postpartum depression, which I thought was so wonderfully done, and such an interesting subject, and something that so many people suffer from. And she doesn’t have the support system that Jane has; all she has is her crazy mother and crazy sister, left with twins, pretty much alone. I thought it was just wonderful that after the three-year jump, we see her almost dealing with motherhood as if it’s a business project. She’s like, I got this, I can do this.  The three-year jump was such a curveball! Was it a curveball for you, too? Oh, absolutely. It was so interesting. As a cast, we had a very hard time dealing with knowing that we were losing Brett [Dier] as a cast member, that Michael was going to go. It was kind of a double thing, because we’re so attached to our characters that by now Michael is like a friend of ours. We care about our characters so much, Petra’s like a friend of mine. And that’s how we feel about Michael. It was almost like we’re about to lose someone we very much care about. So we were mourning Michael, and then also mourning the fact that we’re not going to see Brett every day. So that took some time for me to get over.  But then I absolutely loved how they dealt with it. It gave us all a chance to refresh our characters, and find them in a completely new place, and give them this whole new world, from zen Raphael to perfect-mother Petra.  I also wanted to ask about Jane and Petra’s relationship. They don’t always get along, but they don’t get into too many petty catfights, either. Do you have any thoughts on how relationships between women are usually portrayed on TV, and how “Jane the Virgin” manages to combat those stereotypes? I think there are many different ways that female relationships are portrayed on TV. I think what’s great about Jane and Petra is that they didn’t go in the direction of they hit it off right away, they’re best friends, maybe they have an argument now and then but they’re best friends for life, and they also don’t hate each other. It’s kind of not here, not there. It’s almost like they need each other in spite of themselves.  Petra has a hard time admitting it to herself and to Jane, but she has this great respect for Jane. Jane is someone that she needs in her life. She has a hard time admitting that, because Jane basically has everything Petra doesn’t have. They have these beautiful moments, and they have hard moments. It’s not a completely natural relationship, but you see that when something really difficult happens, something that’s actually life-or-death, they’re there for each other. "
ARTS & CULTURE,Margaret Atwood Admits 'The Handmaid’s Tale' Is More Relevant Than Ever,"A religious fundamentalist society swiftly takes away women’s autonomy — and their rights to their own bodies. If you think the plot of Margaret Atwood’s 1985 novel The Handmaid’s Tale, now widely studied, sounds familiar, you’re not alone: the author agrees. In response to a fan who tweeted, “I read The #HandmaidsTale for the first time during the Obama administration & even that honeymoon wasn’t enough to make it seem unrealistic,” the author responded, “Yes it does seem like the pause before whatever it is that’s happening now ... ” Yes it does seem like the pause before whatever it is that's happening now... https://t.co/cbaoNr6cO5 Atwood’s book, about a woman named Offred who serves as a sexual surrogate to a family that’s having trouble conceiving, will be released as a TV adaptation on Hulu in April. The author has been vocal about the story’s ties to today’s political climate. In a letter she shared through PEN/America in January, she cautioned against “dictators of any kind.” She began the letter with a quote from the novel: “Freedom, like everything else, is relative.” Also on HuffPost:"
ARTS & CULTURE,Feminist Sci-Fi Writers Dream Up A Better Future For Women And Reproductive Health,"According to the rhetoric used by Donald Trump during the presidential debates, women can “rip” babies out of their wombs moments before birth. This imagery runs counter to current laws, which in most states allow abortions only before a fetus has reached 24 to 26 weeks. Some states outlaw abortion as few as 12 weeks after a woman’s most recent menstrual period; North Dakota’s cutoff is six weeks. The president’s language on the issue led pro-life proponents to fear an overturn of Roe v. Wade, a law that younger women may take for granted as a basic right. But stories like Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale, a speculative fiction book from the 1980s that’s getting adapted this year for Hulu, work to remind us that few rights are truly inalienable, and a perfect storm of circumstances could undo the freedoms of millions. While dystopian stories like Atwood’s help readers contextualize the here and now, there’s also a stable of science fiction authors using the genre to explore possible solutions to current problems. So, we asked authors to imagine how reproductive rights could be protected, and improved, in the future. Their answers, below, include birth control injections distributed to both men and women, and socializing kids to take ownership of their own bodies.  “’Women’s health’ is often used as a euphemism for ‘issues related to contraception and abortion.’ Certainly, there are many other health issues faced by cis and trans women alike, but it’s fertility that is often the most heavily legislated and taboo. How does technology solve a problem that is, at its core, a social problem?  “Sure, the creation of artificial wombs sounds nice, but it does not remove the reproductive function of those who do have wombs, and it doesn’t erase the social stigma that many women endure. I’m often asked why I write all-women space operas like The Stars are Legion, or imagine fantastic societies with eight different genders and wild social taboos. I do this because many of our fundamental problems as human beings won’t be solved by creating a widget. There have been all sorts of useful widgets that failed because we could not make them socially palatable (Google Glass, anyone?). But what we need to change first is the stories of ourselves, and what it possible.     “As we’ve seen over the last few months, who controls the narrative over a story has a huge impact on who creates the future. The future of women’s health does not require an artificial womb or a 100 percent effective contraceptive (though both would be nice). Instead, securing a future where cis and trans female bodies are afforded equal respect and research dollars requires a harnessing of the story of who matters. Create the story of who matters, and who is human, and the investment in the right widgets will follow.” “The erosion of women’s rights to bodily autonomy begins early in life and must be approached at the root cause. We must uncouple the relationships between the body, sex, shame, and morality through compulsory education that rightly treats gender, sex, and sexuality as separate and independent subjects. We must reject all notions of the body as dirty or nudity as inherently sexual, desire as uncontrollable and unilateral or coercion as normal in intimate settings. “This starts with granting children their own bodily autonomy; giving them the right to say no, to refuse kisses or cuddles, and never forcing them to show any kind of physical affection to anyone. This starts with toilet training kids without shame and using correct anatomical terms for their bodies. This starts with refraining from color-coding infants and projecting their entire futures and personalities based on their genitals. This starts with outlawing all circumcision, regardless of biological sex. “None of this is unique to women or girls because women’s rights are human rights. We begin to lose them before we’re born, and the rest are given away or stolen later in life because we’ve been conditioned to believe they were never really ours to begin with. Stop that conditioning. Save girls and save the world.” “Throughout history, women’s health has been contentious for reasons entirely cultural. Humanity seems to have a deep, persistent discomfort with sexuality, and female sexuality in particular. While this is easing — slowly, and non-linearly — I expect we’re looking at more centuries than I like to think before we all grow up. “As much as it seems reductive to say it, the issue revolves around women’s role in the human reproductive cycle. In order to depoliticize basic health issues, we need to get to a point where women have control over when (or if) they become pregnant, and how often. The simplest way to do this is through effective, easily-administered birth control. Despite the much-derided results of the trials of male chemical birth control, there’s no doubt we’re moving in a direction where there will be more options for everyone. As these methods become available, use will widen, and eventually they will have an effect similar to a vaccine, establishing a herd immunity against unplanned pregnancy. Eventually, accidental pregnancy will be seen as a medical failure, rather than some kind of cautionary tale — and at that point, perhaps the issue of bodily autonomy won’t be considered so controversial.” [Hopkinson offered to provide an absurdist fictional scenario.] “Science progresses swiftly to the point where transitioning from one gender to another is a complete change which happens at the chromosomal level. 45* comes out as female, becoming the U.S.’s first woman president. Health laws suddenly become more favorable towards women.” “*I won’t call that man the president, so I’m using the term that’s becoming the accepted one for people who feel as I do.” “What could the future hold for reproductive rights? They’ve already tried (and failed) to bring a birth control injection for men to market. Too many side effects ― though they were nominal and possibly caused by other drug interactions. I have to imagine that in the future we might see an improvement on bioidentical hormones, in general, so that women of all ages could not only control when they get pregnant but menopause could be experienced with no symptoms at all. Perhaps doctors could even find a way to keep eggs viable for longer so that women could have children at a much older age ― though in this scenario, aging itself might have to be dealt with! “I think for me, as a mother of teenage girls, I would love to see a birth control injection that lasted for years and was mandatory throughout the world. It sounds completely totalitarian, I know, but I believe that no child, anywhere, should have to deal with the fear of parenthood, the emotional upheaval of abortion, or the trauma involved in adoption. I think allowing girls to grow up before becoming mothers would truly change the cultural, emotional and economic landscape of the entire planet for the better.”"
ARTS & CULTURE,Artist Honors The Legacy Of Britain's Radical Suffragettes,"In 1914, Canadian suffragette Mary Raleigh Richardson entered the National Gallery in London and attacked Diego Velazquez’s famed painting “Rokeby Venus,” which depicts a reclining nude woman gazing at her own reflection.  Richardson, in a statement issued shortly after the attack, explained the slashing was meant to symbolize the violence enacted systematically against women, including their inability to vote. “I have tried to destroy the picture of the most beautiful woman in mythological history as a protest against the government destroying Mrs. Pankhurst, who is the most beautiful character in modern history,” she said, referring to Emmeline Pankhurst, a prominent British suffragette.  Contemporary artist Amy Jorgensen was inspired by Richardson’s act of civil disobedience, one of many enacted by early British suffragettes fighting for the right to vote. In her series “Something Old, Something New, Something Borrowed, Something Blue,” Jorgensen honors the legacy of those who paved the way for women’s rights in the 19th century, including her very own great aunt Edna Berg.   “As a young person, the stories of my great aunt Edna Berg were a staple in family lore and populated many family gatherings,” Jorgensen wrote in an email to The Huffington Post. “She was an extremely outspoken and political member of the family who left rural life in the West and moved to New York City where she was an advocate for women’s rights and a suffragette during the early part of the 20th century. Recognizing myself as a feminist at a young age, my great aunt became a bearing point as I navigated adolescence, even though we never met. In my imagination she became both myth and mentor. Edna Berg was an outlier in the family, as am I.” While researching the details of Berg’s life, Jorgensen came across a trove of surveillance images compiled by the Scotland Yard of British suffragettes at Holloway Prison, which, though now permanently closed, was once the largest women’s prison in western Europe. Intrigued by these photos, and the way they connected themes of protest, women’s rights and surveillance, Jorgensen used the images as source material for her series.  “Something Old, Something New, Something Borrowed, Something Blue” features 18 blue portraits printed on vintage handkerchiefs, balancing ideas of daintiness and resistance, past and present, surveillance and self expression. Each piece in the series features a surveillance photo of a British suffragette, rendered as a cyanotype print atop a vintage handkerchief. Cyanotype printing, an early 19th century photographic process popularized by Anna Atkins, the first female photographer, turns each suffragette’s likeness into a vivid, cobalt-hued image. “The way the stain of cyan spreads across the cloth [mimics] the stains of blood during the menstrual cycle,” Jorgensen explained.  Jorgensen was drawn to handkerchiefs as her canvasses because of their longstanding associations with intimacy, female camaraderie and domesticity. “I was interested in working with a material and object that linked to the historical traditions of women’s work and clothing, the element of handcraft,” she said. “The handkerchiefs were meticulously embroidered by the hands of women, and as objects were worn close to the skin, often in the folds of underclothing.” The title of the series riffs off the wedding tradition of adorning a bride-to-be with various worn trinkets for good luck. “In pairing the surveillance images of militant suffragettes, the wedding rhyme, and the delicacy of a handkerchief, I was interested in creating a collision point for patriarchal structures,” Jorgensen said. “Does this traditional exchange become a form of subversive protest?  Many of the suffragettes imprisoned at Holloway, embroidered their names on a handkerchief as a record of their experiences.” Over 100 years have passed since Richardson slashed the surface of Velazquez’s iconic painting, taking a knife to the male gaze, as well. Jorgensen’s artworks ― delicately riddled with contradictions ― communicate just how far women have come, and how much more work needs to be done.  Amy Jorgensen’s “Something Old, Something New, Something Borrowed, Something Blue” runs until March 12, 2017 at Elizabeth Houston Gallery in New York. "
ARTS & CULTURE,George R.R. Martin’s 'Beauty And The Beast' Would've Been Bloody AF,"“Game of Thrones” author George R. R. Martin is known for bringing serious gore to screens everywhere. So, naturally, his dream version of “Beauty and The Beast” would involve a murderous Beast. Thanks to the much-anticipated release of Disney’s new live-action movie, “Beauty and the Beast” has made a resurgence this year and has us reminiscing about the classic tale. And we’re not just talking about the 1991 animated film. In 1987, there was a CBS TV show entitled “Beauty and the Beast” that starred Linda Hamilton and Ron Perlman as a lawyer named Catherine Chandler and an underground tunnel-dweller named Vincent (aka Beast), respectively. Martin worked on the series as a writer (he’d later become a supervising producer). The show took place in a magical version of New York and involved the duo fighting crime and falling in love. The show had Perlman playing knight in shining armor to Hamilton, but with no twist at the end ― as in, Beast stays beastly the whole time. Love affair and all. There are no whimsical and lifelike candelabras, clocks or teapots. Just some casual bestiality and taking down bad guys. This, apparently, wasn’t enough for Martin, who reportedly wanted more darkness in the series. “There were constant limitations. It wore me down,” Martin said in a 2014 interview with Rolling Stone about his desire to push the show into edgier territory. He continued: There were battles over censorship, how sexual things could be, whether a scene was too “politically charged,” how violent things could be. Don’t want to disturb anyone ... The Beast killed people. That was the point of the character. He was a beast. But CBS didn’t want blood, or for the beast to kill people. They wanted us to show him picking up someone and throwing them across the room, and then they would get up and run away. Oh, my God, horrible monster! [Laughs] It was ludicrous. The character had to remain likable. The CBS show ultimately didn’t survive after (spoiler!) Catherine was killed, and the Beast became a mopey mess. In the end, he never got to revel in the gore and glory Martin wanted for him. We’ll just have to leave the “Game of Thrones”-esque version of “Beauty and The Beast” ― where Beast slits throats, fights White Walkers, and leads an army of anthropomorphic household items to prepare for winter ― to our dreams.

ARTS & CULTURE,Empathy - Humanity's Greatest Lost Art,"Millennials make up the most diverse demographic ever in American history.  From ethnic background to career choice and lifestyle — there’s never been a generation like us. Yet, we still live in a world and time defined by what divides us.  There are competing points of view on just about everything. From how we should talk, what religion we should practice, what music we should listen to, what we should eat to how we perceive the value of things, there’s always one side versus another. And most times it’s relatively easy to pick a side — you just go along with whichever resonates better based on your personal experiences.  This same logic can be applied to the founding principles of this country. Since the founding of the United States of America, there have been competing views on how our constitution should be interpreted. Like most arguments it’s one largely supported by values based on personal experience. The two competing theories are Originalism vs. Living Constitution. Originalists believe that the constitution should retain the meaning that the authors, otherwise known as “Founding Fathers” intended. This view states that interpretation of the constitution should be based on how the authors of the constitution intended it in 1787. The contrasting view is the Living Constitution theory whose supporters believe that the “Founding Fathers” lived in a very specific time with specific values based on their personal experiences. Therefore, the constitution today should be analyzed as a living-breathing document. This view allows for the constitution and the laws created as a result to be analyzed with a more modern perspective of today’s value set, so that the effect of the constitution aligns more closely with the advances in our current society. While you and I can argue on which theory best serves our society, these debates in constitutional analysis seep into a more widespread and commonly known dichotomy: Us vs. Them.  American culture has a similar on-going debate based on personal experience between people who don’t want things to change vs. people who think things should be ever changing. Those that don’t want what it means to be an American to change believe that the ethnic demographic, class structure, and work culture of our country should remain as it was when each had certain characteristics overwhelmingly accepted by the majority.  Those that think what it means to be an American is ever-changing believe that America is simply a body of land that symbolizes opportunity and freedom and that the make up of our country has a “living-breathing” existence. I’m a part of the group that believes America, like the rest of the world, is ever changing and that embracing the nuances in us all makes for a more fortified existence. The magic to positively change the world happens when we stretch beyond the scope of our own personal experiences to work with someone with a different experience than our own. Empathy is humanity’s most precious asset but also its greatest lost art. Our ability to empathize with anyone in the world is contingent upon our level of exposure to their experiences. We can’t relate to what we’re not exposed to. We can’t aspire to what we’re not exposed to. What we’re exposed to shapes our perspective and in order to expand or change that perspective, we must expand the scope of our experiences.  Recognizing this blatant truth, I decided to embark on a yearlong travel and cultural journey to uncover what connects us all. It’s an explorative journey as well as significant social experiment to eliminate the “versus” mentality that exists in all of us and increase the level of empathy we exercise daily.  I am utilizing a remote work program to facilitate my travel. Beginning this month, I will go to 12 different cities in 10 different countries over the course of the year. I will spend one month in each city. As a first-time traveler to each country, I will be placing a lens on the experience and publishing it in the form of a docuseries, that way we all have the opportunity to grow together as it’s happening. I’m calling my journey Extended Family because for most of us family is the group of people that we’re more willing to give the benefit of the doubt. Even at a family reunion when you may not know someone, as soon as a relative introduces that person as such and such’s uncle or your cousin by way of a, b, or c, you immediately treat them with a different warmth; an increased level of respect.  The depth of our empathy is strengthened and tested when dealing with family. And that’s how we should practice treating strangers we meet on a day-to-day basis, like extended family.  To become part of the Extended Family, join the journey with me on Instagram @bcamboss. "
ARTS & CULTURE,7 Tips For Choosing The Best Idea For Your Novel,"You can picture the scrawling letters of your name on the cover of that book. You’ve imagined your first book signing, your first time holding your work in your hands, and the first time you see your title on the Bestsellers List. You’re thirsting to be published, and you’ve got the passion, skill, and time to make it happen. There’s just one problem.  You have no idea what your novel will be about. You’re not alone. For many aspiring writers, the idea for a first novel is elusive and fickle. Writing an entire novel is a time-consuming, gut-wrenching task. You want to make sure you’re invested in an idea you’re passionate about and that could pay off. But how do you go about finding the idea if you have nowhere to start? Let me be clear, at the risk of making this article seem less valuable: There is no single equation, formula, or step-by-step guide that can tell you how to find that spark. Each writer is different, and part of the beauty of the author’s journey is figuring out what incites your creativity and idea generation. For some lucky writers, like Stephanie Meyers, a novel idea comes in the form of a dream. For J.K. Rowling, it came on a delayed train. Still others juxtapose ideas from images, like Suzanne Collins’s The Hunger Games Trilogy. We can all cross our fingers and hope for an awe-inspiring idea to make itself known in an obvious way. For many of us, though, the process is more tedious and less tangible at the start. After having six novels published and three more drafted, I’ve come to realize that generating an idea for a novel is a nail-biting experience that takes patience, courage, and imagination. Nonetheless, there are ways writers can work through the initial idea generation to find one worth investing in. Orson Scott Card once said, “Everybody walks past a thousand story ideas every day. The good writers are the ones who see five or six of them. Most people don’t see any.” In truth, ideas are waiting for you to grab them—if you’re willing to see them around you.  Think about your own life experiences, and look for inspiration in everyday life. This is how you find relatability in your idea. Now, expand upon it. Make it more suspenseful, more emotional, more exciting. Make it larger than life. Many writers talk about the importance of reading. I think this is so true. To write a novel means you have the goal of emotionally impacting another person, for better or worse. To know what idea will do that, you must know what ideas move you. Read voraciously and constantly evaluate what makes you feel something. Then, apply these principles when searching for the idea that will allow you to express emotion in the deepest way. We are all moved by something different. You have to know yourself before you can write a novel that will help others uncover their own emotions. I will sit on ideas for novels for anywhere between a few weeks to a few years. For an idea to be “the one” that will be enticing enough for the reader and for you the writer, it needs to be able to stand the test of time. Give an idea time to sink in. You’ll know when it’s the right one because it won’t stop haunting you. Make sure you have access to tablets and journals throughout your day so you can write down quotes, ideas, and snippets that are interesting. These can sometimes be combined into an idea you can use for an entire novel. By combining elements, you can come up with an idea that is unique in its concept. I ask “what if” all of the time. My next novel started as a “what if” question when my husband and I were driving on a snow-covered back road. The “what if” game is an extension of number one on this list—it allows you to extract an idea from real life and play it up.  I often check the Manuscript Wish List Hashtag (#MSWL) on Twitter or the Manuscript Wish List website to see what agents are looking for. Obviously, you will not have time to write an entire manuscript in order to meet their request in a timely fashion. I’m also not suggesting you only write a book because it is “trendy” or “marketable.” Still, you can discover interesting ideas for novels that might just grab your attention and start you down a creative road. Sometimes as writers we forget the most important part about writing—living. Novels, even fiction, comment on the world, on humanity, and on the experiences that connect us. To have engaging ideas and storylines, we must experience the world in every form. We must connect with people, try new things, and be adventurous. So if you’re still looking for your idea, get out into the vast world and live. You’d be surprised just when and how an idea might come to you.

ARTS & CULTURE,Banksy Built A Hotel Overlooking The Israel-Palestine Barrier,"Welcome to “The Walled Off Hotel,” a nine-room guesthouse located in the West Bank city of Bethlehem. The dystopian inn looks out onto the barrier that separates Israel from Palestine, and its walls are covered with work by iconic anonymous street artist Banksy.  “The aim is to tell the story of the wall from every side and give visitors the opportunity to discover it for themselves,” Banksy said in a statement. The artist hopes his newest art project, a functional hotel, will entice young Israelis to visit the controversial site, even though the journey would entail an illegal journey through Palestinian-controlled land.  “I would like to invite everyone to come here, invite Israeli civilians to come visit us here,” hotel manager Wisam Salsaa said. “We want them to learn more about us, because when they know us it will break down the stereotypes and things will change.” The hotel itself is also designed to educate visitors and incite dialogue between them ― in typical Banksy fashion, with a dark sense of humor. On one bedroom wall, a mural depicts an Israeli man and a Palestinian man engaged in a pillow fight. Another wall features an array of surveillance cameras lined up like trophies of a hunt.  The hotel website described its piano bar as follows: “Guests can peruse a collection of Banksy artworks that include vandalized oil paintings and statues choking on tear gas fumes. Warm scones and freshly brewed tea are served daily on fine bone china and the Walled Off Salad should not be missed.” The piano bar is a visual nod to Britain’s colonial legacy on Palestinian territory. The hotel’s opening was coordinated to correspond with the centennial of the 1917 Balfour Declaration, which declared the U.K.’s support for Palestine serving as a national home for the Jewish people. Also included on the hotel premises is a gallery devoted to showing the work of Palestinian artists. Curated by Housni Alkhateeb Shehada, the space is meant to provide artists who often have trouble traveling access to a wider audience.  The hotel will open to guests on March 11, and rooms start at just $30 a night. Not too shabby to be up close and personal with artworks worth millions of dollars. You will, however, be forced to put down a $1,000 deposit up front, to ensure that the valuable artworks are not stolen or vandalized.  “The artwork here has been donated to the community and their struggle,” the artist wrote online, “and any person found attempting to steal from them, or deface hotel property, will be arrested, transported to the police station in Ramallah and prosecuted to the full extent of local law.” Book your room at the Banksy hotel here. "
ARTS & CULTURE,'White Tears' Is The Horror Story 'La La Land' Should Have Become,"Despite dramatically failing to win Best Picture at the Academy Awards, “La La Land” was a film juggernaut of 2016. Audiences and critics thrilled to its romantic, yet melancholy, portrayal of an idealistic jazz fiend (Ryan Gosling) who privileges musical purity. Well, not universally ― some bridled at the positioning of white keyboardist Sebastian as the savior of jazz music; his foil, the sellout of the film, is played by John Legend. The white guy is the one who really cares, and by his caring he earns a certain ownership over the pure jazz tradition. He represents the best of jazz.  For filmgoers who chafed at seeing a bland hipster tap his way into a white savior role for an African-American musical tradition, White Tears will hit bookstores bearing inside a remarkably similar setup ― but also the comeuppance “La La Land” never gave to Sebastian. Where “La La Land” is a nostalgic musical romance, White Tears is a supernatural mystery, a horror story, and ultimately a tale of black Americans’ historical exploitation by white profiteers. The novel opens on Seth, the book’s narrator, living in New York City and wandering the streets recording the ambient sounds he encounters. It’s not long after college, and he lives with Carter, his best friend from the liberal arts school they attended together. Seth is awkward, nerdy and self-conscious of his tenuous position in life as a new graduate with little safety net, but Carter buoys the partnership with his careless charisma, his single-minded passions, and, perhaps most importantly, his seemingly endless supply of cash. Carter Wallace is a scion of an enormously wealthy family, and he uses his dough to fund his and Seth’s shared pursuit: music.  The odd couple’s friendship was forged over music ― specifically, their particular interest in how the sounds they love are created. Though Seth prefers new, shiny music like EDM (old music makes him feel uncomfortably unmoored from the present, as he slips deeply into what he listens to), Carter’s ideal is the early, unpolished era of musical recording. Such is the strength of his personality, and the depth of Seth’s naive admiration for his new friend, that the obsession with vintage records, specifically the blues, becomes a shared one. Carter’s place, and later their apartment, fills up with expensive mixing boards and rare vintage microphones; he pays top dollar for blues records, the older the better. They begin collecting 78 RPM records, which were common in the gramophone era but were mostly phased out by mid-century ― 45s are too close to modern audio recording for their taste. In college, Carter is a typical white Rasta; by the time they’ve moved to the city, he’s savvier, a hipster in an old-fashioned haircut and suspenders. “We really did feel that our love of the music bought us something, some right to blackness, but by the time we got to New York, we’d learned not to talk about it,” Seth recalls. “We didn’t want to be mistaken for the kind of suburban white boys who post pictures of themselves holding malt liquor bottles and throwing gang signs.” Of course, the blues buddies aren’t any different from those suburban white boys, save for their tact about flaunting their self-perceived ownership of black musical tropes. Their love for the music convinces them that the music is for them. They set up shop as a boutique production company, pursuing the crackling, analog sound that Carter deems authentic.  Instead of triumph, however, what ensues is dizzying mayhem. The pair becomes fascinated by a blues song Seth picked up while recording chess players at Washington Square Park. Carter convinces Seth, the skilled one of the operation, to rework the recording ― playing it through a feeble vintage speaker to re-record it, layering it with fuzz and distortion: “By the time I’d finished, it sounded like a worn 78, the kind of recording that only exists in one poor copy, a thread on which time and memory hang.” Carter fakes a record label and calls the mysterious singer Charlie Shaw; he dates the song to 1928 and releases it on a file-sharing site. Blues collectors clamor over this precious discovery, bidding to buy the record.  Then one commenter posts a series of all-caps queries, insisting that they meet in person to discuss their finding. “Now I will tell you something,” he types, once the meeting has been arranged. “Before you posted that song, I had not heard Charlie Shaw since 1959.” They’re dismissive, certain that Charlie Shaw is a figment of their own masterful imaginations and encyclopedic 1920s blues knowledge. Then tragedy strikes Carter, leaving Seth panicked and at odds with his friend’s wealthy, insular family, who are already suspicious of their son’s trust-fund-free friend ― except for Leonie, Carter’s older sister and an aspiring artist. Together, Leonie and Seth journey South in hopes of saving her brother and locating the real Charlie Shaw ― if the real Charlie Shaw exists. In the process, Seth is confronted with police brutality against black men, the roots of the prison-industrial complex in slavery and Jim Crow, and the exploited, unrecognized work of black musicians ― which become closely intertwined in the narrative. The book is moody, threatening, and profoundly dark; Kunzru’s prose has a Delilloesque density, constructing settings and atmospheres so charged and vivid they seem to envelop the reader in a miasma of mise-en-scène. Carter and Seth’s work, and the idealistic gloss they layer over a creeping sense of historical guilt, receives no artistically optimistic reading from Kunzru. “He respects the music,” Seth tells Leonie, defensively. “That doesn’t make them like you any better,” she replies. “It’s theirs. They’d rather you left it to them.” It’s a glib reading of a complex dynamic, offered by an insulated daughter of privilege, but there’s a kernel of truth: The boys can’t buy authenticity and ownership of the blues tradition with the strength of their interest. It belongs to someone else. Kunzru, a British writer of Indian descent, is here taking on a dynamic somewhat outside his direct experience. When it comes to the black blues tradition, he’s taking an outsider perspective: the reader comes along with him on Seth’s journey, one defined by historical naivety and self-absorption. White Tears isn’t exactly a re-centering of black experience, but a collapsing of the white hero mythology that often guides American movies, books and TV shows that nominally address black culture. It zeroes in on an impulse that yearns to be pure, uncompromising and compensatory, finding the nasty worm of entitlement and exploitation that’s burrowed at the heart. By the time White Tears resolves, it’s still tricky to assign a single genre to the novel: It’s a story about ghosts, about sounds reverberating not just through space but through time, about grievances leaking through the fabric of decades, and about retribution, violence and hatred. At every turn, Kunzru’s words concoct a dreamlike world where the past isn’t dead, nor even past, and the boundaries of reality flicker at the margins. For a nation seduced by a fantasy of white appropriation, maybe a horror story of white appropriation is exactly what we need. The Bottom Line: In hypnotic style, White Tears punctures the fantasy of a white male musical hero championing black artistic traditions, uncovering a dark and ugly underbelly. What other reviewers think: Publishers Weekly: “The excellent new novel from Kunzru (Gods Without Men) opens as a coming-of-age yarn and ends as a ghost story, but its real subject is a vital piece of American history: the persistence of cultural appropriation in popular music.” Kirkus: “Record collecting turns dangerous in a smart, time-bending tale about cultural appropriation.”  Who wrote it? Hari Kunzru is a British novelist. He has been recognized as one of Granta’s 20 Best Young British Novelists (2003) and awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship (2014). White Tears is his fifth novel. Fun fact: Kunzru is married to Katie Kitamura, whose well-received novel A Separation came out in February. Who will read it?  Fans of gritty literary genre fiction and racially provocative novels. Opening lines: “That summer I would ride my bike over the bridge, lock it up in front of one of the bars on Orchard Street and drift through the city on foot, recording. People and places. Sidewalk smokers, lover’s quarrels, drug deals. I wanted to store the world and play it back just as I’d found it, without change or addition. I collected audio of thunderstorms, music coming out of cars, the subway trains rumbling underfoot; it was all reality, a quality I had lately begun to crave, as if I were deficient in some necessary vitamin or mineral.”  Notable passage: “The first thing he told me after he unbolted the door was that I should prepare to cry. He’d cried. He’d been crying for two hours straight. He told me to just sit and listen ― I wouldn’t be the same after. He turned to the desk, and through the studio speakers came the sound of a New York street. Traffic, the sound of footsteps. My footsteps. I quickly recognized Tompkins Square in the East Village. I could hear barking from the dog run, skaters panhandling by the benches. He turned up the volume. I heard myself walk past the skaters into a sort of aural dead zone. The street noise faded, the dogs too. The only significant signal was the sound of a guitar, someone fingerpicking in a weird open tuning that made the instrument seem to wail and moan. It was mesmerizing, the performance of a musician struggling with inexpressible pain and loss. The recording was completely clear, unmarred by voices or traffic.” White TearsBy Hari KunzruKnopf, $26.95Publishes March 14, 2017   The Bottom Line is a weekly review combining plot description and analysis with fun tidbits about the book."
ARTS & CULTURE,The Sartorial Genius Of Georgia O'Keeffe,"The great American painter Georgia O’Keeffe flooded canvases with color, conjuring plants and sunsets and lakes with a generous relationship to her palette. At the mere mention of her name, images of flowers surely come to mind, their petals spread open in front of the viewer, each stamen and stigma brushed with heavy doses of gold or pink or green. Yet images of the artist herself, who was born in 1887 in Sun Prairie, Wisconsin, are mostly devoid of color. She preferred to memorialize herself in black and white, as evidenced by the astounding number of portraits for which she posed. In front of the camera ― whether it was held by her husband Alfred Stieglitz or a slew of other famous photographers including Ansel Adams, Philippe Halsman, Bruce Weber, Annie Leibowitz and Andy Warhol ― she frequently appeared in monochrome. She was more likely to brandish a cape and bowler hat, accessories coded male at the time, than a floral dress or broach. “Everyone wanted to redress her to make her appear more feminine,” Wanda Corn, a Professor Emerita in art history at Stanford, and the guest curator behind the Brooklyn Museum’s latest show, “Georgia O’Keeffe: Living Modern,” explained in a tour on Wednesday. But O’Keeffe was steadfast in her style: minimalist, modern, androgynous, deliberate. “She was black-and-white before she met Stieglitz,” Corn added, echoing the overall tone of her show. O’Keeffe was no one’s muse. Aware of her place in history before it was even set, she sat in front of cameras to take hold of her public persona. She dressed in monochrome, capes and all, to cleverly feed her growing status not just as an artist, but a pioneer of every aesthetic she touched. ”Living Modern” bills itself as the first exhibition to examine O’Keeffe’s “self-crafted persona.” With a cascade of artworks paired with personal objects from O’Keeffe’s wardrobe, the show tells a story of how she evolved beyond the easel. The paintings and photographs and pieces of her closet ― handmade dresses, denim, hats, shoes, jewelry ― reveal how she owned her identity, and her eventual celebrity. The exhibition, separated into four parts, follows her early rise in the New York art world, where she had her first solo show at the Brooklyn Museum in 1927, to the years she spent traveling to the American Southwest, a region that would steal her heart, to the career she nurtured after Stieglitz died. The black-and-white custom suits she’d wear to meetings or openings in New York contrast with the chambray button-down shirts and cowboy hats that marked her New Mexico existence. She was rarely photographed in the latter; more often she was seen in the wrap dresses that constituted her signature outfit later in life, with little or no embellishments. “Nothing is less real than realism ― details are confusing,” she famously said. “It is only by selection, by elimination, by emphasis, that we get the real meaning of things.”  “Living Modern” is part of the Brooklyn Museum’s “Year of Yes,” a series of programs that celebrate the 10th anniversary of the institution’s Sackler Center for Feminist Art. The decision to spotlight O’Keeffe’s clothes, in conjunction with an anniversary aimed at “reimagining feminism,” was made with careful thought. Corn has been planning the O’Keeffe tribute since at least 2011, Cody Hartley, senior director of collections and interpretation at the O’Keeffe Museum in Santa Fe, told The Huffington Post. Much of the clothing on view comes from the two homes, once owned by the artist, that are now managed by the O’Keeffe. Would Corn have organized a similar exhibition for a male artist who’d lived his life so strategically through clothing? “Yes, I think she would have,” Hartley explained. Of course, the appeal of such an exhibition centered on O’Keeffe, rather than any male artist, is that her clothing ― whether she made pieces herself, commissioned them, or voraciously collected them ― was an extension of her agency in a male-dominated realm. She understood the power of putting on a cape, more often worn by male artists, and staring into a camera. She understood how her personal style, not just her art, could reflect her sincere commitment to modernism. She earned her title, Mother of American Modernism, by being in charge of her identity. The last room of the Brooklyn Museum show appropriately focuses on O’Keeffe’s life after Stieglitz, the artist who helped catapult her to fame. Before she died at the age of 98, O’Keeffe had become a beacon for a new wave of feminism, a celebrity reincarnated, at least for the 1960s generation who knew her only as a single artist. At the end of her life, O’Keeffe was the woman, independent in her career and style, who’d left New York City behind for the freedom and solitude of New Mexico. Living a life close to the land, she dabbled in organic gardening and cooking. She was “prescient” to a new audience of housewives, students and young feminists, Corn said, who weren’t so familiar with her early career alongside Stieglitz. They’d later read her interview with Andy Warhol in 1983, or read her 1974 New Yorker profile, or visited her major exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American art in 1970, which later traveled to Chicago and San Fransisco.  Today, over 30 years after her death, O’Keeffe is still a celebrity. While she never fully embraced the feminism that adopted her as an icon during her life ― “Write about women. Or write about artists. I don’t see how they’re connected,” she once told a journalist ― her ability to move through life unencumbered by expectations, so ready to take control of her image out in the world, continues to garner respect.  Her face, peering at viewers dozens of times throughout the halls of the Brooklyn Museum, dares you to think otherwise. “Georgia O’Keeffe: Living Modern” is on view from March 3 to July 23 in the Morris A. and Meyer Schapiro Wing on the fourth floor of the Brooklyn Museum."
ARTS & CULTURE,Artist Honors The History Of Broken Promises That Preceded Standing Rock,"From a distance, Gina Adams’ quilts look familiar ― well-worn and stitched with intricate geometric patterns in vibrant colors, they wouldn’t look out of place draped on a couch at a rustic bed-and-breakfast. The closer one looks, however, the more unusual they look. Letters and words begin to leap out from the checkered colors, and still closer examination shows that the quilts are spelling out pieces of history. In this project, “Its Honor Is Here Pledged,” Adams sewed the words of broken treaties between the U.S. government and Native American tribes onto quilts, creating soft blankets with sharp messages. “Sewing together injustice with an object of comfort stirs deep emotion,” wrote Adams in her statement on the works.  In an email to The Huffington Post, the artist explained that seeing native people in America use quilts for warmth was a common theme in her research of old photos in the Smithsonian Museum and archives. “Blankets were one thing that was given to the Native people who were forced to move to the new reservations,” she wrote. “It is my wish that the viewer gain an understanding that there is a relationship between the treaty text and the impact that it still has on present generations.” To create the artworks, Adams used quilts she found in “antique stores, flea markets and gathered from dusty attics,” specifically seeking out faded, frayed and torn blankets. “I wanted to use a material that was created one hundred years ago,” she told HuffPost. “I feel the age in the quilt speaks to the language and implied weariness that still exists in the treaties.” On top of the aging fabric, she sewed letters cut from new and old calico ― a colorful cotton fabric. The swatches were carefully chosen to work together with and across the original quilt, “creating a rhythm” viewers are drawn into. The colors of the words weren’t chosen with an eye to clarity; Adams told HuffPost that she wanted “the fabric letters to blend and fade weaving in and out of the quilts surface.” It’s a visual strain to piece together the full text on a quilt, yet certain letters jump out, enticing one to read more closely. “The language of these treaties was meant to be confusing,” she wrote. “It’s 100 plus years later and the words still are today.” The many broken treaties signed by the U.S. government with Native tribes have been centuries-long grievances for those tribes, but have been more recently brought to the national media spotlight by protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline by the Standing Rock Sioux. The pipeline was rerouted to tunnels under Lake Oahe, near the Standing Rock reservation, which the tribe protested, in part, as a violation of the 1851 Treaty of Fort Laramie. “What is happening at Standing Rock is directly connected to the treaties and the protection that they give to Native American lands and water,” Adams pointed out. “In the treaties it is stated that not the United States nor any other corporation or company would ever be allowed to alter the territory stated with in them.” After taking office in January, President Donald Trump signed an executive order allowing the pipeline to move forward.  Apparent continuing violations of these treaties provide little hope for healing ― especially given the horrific treatment of the protesters, who refer to themselves as “water protectors,” encamped at Standing Rock. But Adams’ quilts are their own bid for recognition and healing, and she told HuffPost that they sprang from “the hope that change could occur.” That change would start, she said, with an apology, one given “out loud and directly from all United States Government... This apology would begin the process of healing for Native people of the United States who carry inherited trauma and pain... With these apologies, it would be possible that a great healing would begin.” That healing, she added, would only be the first step: “Once the healing begins, then the work of going back to the language of the original documents and taking accountability for all of the articles and promises that were given should happen.” “My hope was that present people would reconsider the need to reinvestigate the treaties,” she wrote. “Viewers come into the installed gallery space expecting to just see art quilts… they don’t expect the emotions they feel from the language that exists with the space. The beauty is that art does have the power to create ripples of change. If we don’t as a collective people start with small ripples the larger ones may never happen.” View some of Adams’s quilts below, and check out her work on her website.  H/T Hyperallergic"
ARTS & CULTURE,French Artist 'Dazed' After Living In A Rock For A Week,"French artist Abraham Poincheval was freed from a block of stone in a Paris museum on Wednesday after spending seven days enclosed in it. He entombed himself in a body-shaped slot carved in a limestone boulder on Feb 22 at Paris’ Palais de Tokyo contemporary art museum. Poincheval, 44, ate stewed fruit and purees while breathing through an air vent. He had some personal items such as a log book and an emergency phone line. “I’m a little dazed, which I imagine is totally normal after one week living in a rock (...) which hosted me well. I thank it very much for having been so enthusiastic about welcoming me,” he told reporters minutes after his release.  “Yes, there were very long moments of loss of self, where suddenly (...) you no longer know where you are, but you are there, and that is what was great (about it),” he said. The artist was helped out of the room by medical team to the applauds of an audience that had gathered to witness his release. In 2014, Poincheval spent 13 days living inside a hollowed-out bear sculpture, eating worms and beetles to mirror a bear’s diet."
ARTS & CULTURE,Diving Into Lorde's Dreamy And Dramatic Album Art,"Lorde revealed the album art for her sophomore album “Melodrama” today, a painting by New York–based artist Sam McKinniss. The image depicts our Lorde and savior tucked into bed, locking the viewer in with her signature intense-as-hell gaze. McKinniss has described intensity as a core element of his artistic practice, illuminating a parallel between the two artists’ penetrating styles. “I think that’s always been my style really, just looking at pictures intensely,” he told Gayletter in 2013. “Being intense. And see if you can respond in some way to the world that you live in visually with light and color.”  It’s understandable why an artist obsessed with intensity, light and color is the perfect choice to visualize the album whose first single is called “Green Light,” and was described by Lorde on Twitter as “the story of the last 2 wild, fluorescent years of my life.”  LANA 4EVER A post shared by Sam McKinniss (@wkndpartyupdate) on Feb 18, 2017 at 12:58pm PST Along with intensity, McKinniss’ paintings, which often feature pop culture icons as their subjects, feed off drama. Talking to ArtNews, he described “human perversity, elegance and drama” as the key motivations behind his work. In his loving yet slightly depraved depictions of cult celebrities from Lana del Rey to Winona Ryder, McKinniss’ fixation with spectacle is on full view. His painted subjects are drenched in shadow and electric light, elevating them from humans to icons, celebrities to artworks. Sounds just about right for an album called “Melodrama.” From the little we’ve seen and heard regarding Lorde’s upcoming album, McKinniss’ blend of neon light and dark underbelly makes for a stunning visualization of Lorde’s matured sound.

ARTS & CULTURE,Your New Favorite Adult Coloring Book Honors The Drag Kings And Queens Of The South,"We’ve covered a lot of adult coloring books in the past few years. So much so that the mere sight of a black-and-white mandala is the furthest thing from soothing to us. But when we got a glimpse of an upcoming coloring book celebrating the drag royalty of the South, our faith in the genre was restored.  Illustrator Kasten McClellan Searles is the magical force behind Drag Queens of the South, a coloring book devoted to real-life drag performers who dazzle Southern states.  “I’ve had a love for and fascination with drag queens ever since sneaking out to my first show as a teen,” Searles wrote in an email to The Huffington Post. “Drag shows have always been a welcome escape from my own daily creative work. During graduate school my friends and I would visit The Rose Room in Dallas and I was so inspired by the performances I saw there. Jenna Skyy and Cassie Nova lit up the stage with grace and humor.” Searles began to wonder if there could be a way to combine her passion for drawing with her love of drag culture when the idea hit. As she put it: “The hair, the fashion, the makeup, the nails ― who wouldn’t want to color all that?” To find her subjects, Searles scoped out local drag and gay clubs and approached kings and queens to be her muses. If they were into the idea ― and everyone was ― Searles snapped some reference photos and watched them perform. She then translated the images into black-and-white line drawings just waiting to be glammed up with a rainbow treatment.  Searles is currently raising funds to produce the book on Kickstarter, and she’s already earned more than double her initial goal of $2,000. Many excited backers have written to her suggesting their favorite local clubs and queens, and Searles is hoping to visit and illustrate as many of them as possible.  Through her project, Searles hopes to pay tribute to the drag community while also helping some adults engage in some much needed stress mitigation. “If I can provide some stress relief, humor, and honor these amazing drag performers, I’ll be very happy,” she continued. “If you haven’t been out to a show recently, get out there and support your local drag queens!” Support Make 100: Drag Queens of the South on Kickstarter before March 7 here."
ARTS & CULTURE,How A Ghanian-German Artist Uses Personal Style To Express Her Hybrid Identity,"Zohra Opoku was 12 years old when she first started sewing her own outfits, bored by the options available to her in East Germany, where she lived. The budding artist, of Ghanaian and German descent, realized then the transcendent power that fashion possessed. Clothing could communicate cultural allegiances and familial traditions, personal style could serve as a sort of hybridized autobiography, and rebellious ensembles allowed one to break free ― at least, somewhat ― of circumstances and heritage, giving fantasy physical form. “I actually created my first winter jacket out of scraps of jeans with neon yellow pieces,” she told i-D. “Expressing myself with individual style seemed to me to be the only way to escape from the grey reality of the GDR [German Democratic Republic].” Now, Opoku lives Accra, Ghana, where she works as a multimedia artist practicing in installation, sculpture and photography. Though she does not identify as a fashion designer, African textiles and the spirit of dress-up play a major role in her work. She’s composed large-scale installations made from second-hand clothes, imported materials from Germany to Ghana, and often transfers her screen-printed photographs onto bedsheets to evoke childhood memories of laundry hanging out to dry.  Opoku’s ongoing fixation with fashion is rooted in its ability to render one’s interior state onto the body and beyond it. “Textiles feel like the perfect vehicle with which identity can be performed,” she told the website Omenka. “It is the outcome of my research on how fashion, trends and clothes traditions are related to a cultural identity that I then perform in my photographs, video, sculptures and installations.”  A series of Opoku’s photographic self-portraits are on view this week at The Armory Fair, exhibited by Somali-French gallerist Mariane Ibrahim. The images feature Opoku in the forest behind her Ghana home. In the early morning light, Opoku captures herself ― adorned with striking ensembles and jewelry ― partially submerged in her natural surroundings. The foliage and its fruits become improvised accessories, natural jewels that both complement and mask their wearer.  This gesture refers to the experience of moving to a new environment and trying to fit in, one Opoku underwent when relocating from Germany to Ghana. She has compared the feeling of blending in with a new habitat to the West African tradition of masquerade ― in which citizens pay homage to guardian spirits, while poking fun at religious and spiritual leaders, by dressing up in elaborate, handmade disguises that turn the world topsy-turvy. For Opoku, who both relocated across continents and switched fields from fashion to fine art, identity is something textured and hyphenated. Clothing, photography and disguise all offer up a stage on which she can consciously perform certain aspects of herself while hiding others. In this realm, where trees become improvised outfits and photos conceal as much as they reveal, the lines between make-believe, camouflage, hiding and invisibility tend to blur. In Ghana, Opoku is moved by the abundance of nature, which constantly yields artistic inspiration and potential new getups. Yet there is no opposition between the domains of fashion and nature, which might otherwise appear at odds. Rather, the two bleed into one another, just as a twig becomes a veil in one of Opoku’s photos. “I love the sound of nature and the smooth movements of leafs in the wind,” the artist said. “These sequences remind me of a dream or a mystic appearance, which refer back to ideas of invisibility and masquerade.” See Opoku’s work this week at Mariane Ibrahim Gallery, Booth P02, at The Armory Show in New York.

ARTS & CULTURE,These Iconic Women Artists Deserve A Special Place In The History Books,"Although women artists have been carving out a space for themselves for centuries, they still aren’t often featured in major galleries, or studied as part of the art historical canon. Which is why writer Bridget Quinn decided to collect their stories in Broad Strokes: 15 Women Who Made Art and History (in That Order). The book surveys women painters such as Artemisia Gentileschi, the Italian Baroque painter who gave Caravaggio’s dramatic use of light her own twist, and Susan O’Malley, whose text-based messages are hopeful beacons to fellow San Francisco–based creators.  When illustrator Lisa Congdon was approached by publisher Chronicle Books to work on Quinn’s project, she jumped at the chance. “So many of my personal heroines are in the book,” she told The Huffington Post in an interview. Congdon’s especially partial to O’Malley, whom she knew personally before the artist’s untimely death, and Louise Bourgeois, whose work inspires her own. “I am particularly influenced by her simplistic monochrome paintings and prints, the highly personal nature of her work and her exploration into domesticity and ‘women’s work,’” Congdon said.  She’s also a fan of Ruth Asawa’s large-scale public works. “Back in the ‘90s I taught elementary school in San Francisco, and I remember teaching my students about the role of geometry in her work,” Congdon said. “This was long before I became a working artist myself!”  Congdon drew Asawa’s portrait in front of a pattern of blue shapes that match her sculptures, and Bourgeois’ image in front of red flowers. Each of the artists she depicts is framed by a pattern that uniquely captures her aesthetic.  “Portraits are tough, especially drawing portraits of famous, recognizable people! There is so much to capture, and it’s important to me that my portrait looks like the actual person. It’s my way of honoring that person, to get it as close as I am able,” Congdon said. “At the same time, I want the portrait to have a sense of style or distinctiveness that sets it apart from the photograph that I used as reference. Sometimes the pattern is a nod to the subject, like in the case of Louise Bourgeois, the symbols I used and the color red were very intentional.” More than anything, Congdon hopes her work will encourage viewers to consider the lives of the women she drew. “I want people to look at the portraits and feel something,” she said. “Maybe even that they get a glimpse into the soul of the artist.” See more illustrations by Lisa Congdon, from the book Broad Strokes by Bridget Quinn, published by Chronicle Books 2017, below:"
ARTS & CULTURE,St. Vincent's Sleek Ernie Ball Collaboration Is An 'Equal-Opportunity' Guitar,"When Annie Clark, aka St. Vincent, announced the release of her guitar design collaboration with Ernie Ball manufacturers on Instagram in mid-2015, she described it as “a tool that would be ergonomic, lightweight, and sleek.” The angular aesthetic of her design is getting an update for 2017, with a new set of colors: Tobacco Burst, Heritage Red, Stealth Black and Polaris White — the latter of which she’s nicknamed “the thin white duke,” the same moniker given to David Bowie. “Bowie’s like air. People just need Bowie to live,” she told The Huffington Post. Discussing her visual aims for the guitar, Clark continued, “I was going for a kind of retro-future aesthetic. I’m very fond of the Memphis school of design, and I’m fond of angularity in design. So I was going for that, rather than round shapes.” The guitar features an African mahogany body, with a hand-rubbed rosewood neck and St. Vincent inlays — the two intersecting circles that represent the “S” in her logo.  She’s seen photos of her Ernie Ball guitar in action. “One of my favorite guitar players — Omar [Rodríguez-López] from The Mars Volta and At the Drive-In — is playing a white one, left-handed. I couldn’t say enough good things about his guitar playing. I’m thrilled that he likes it.” The instrument, Clark is clear, is an “equal-opportunity guitar,” even if the press latched on to her comment in 2015 that the design left “room for a breast. Or two,” hailing it as a boon for female guitarists. And while the design is lightweight and sleek, there’s no gender attached to it. “I was making a joke,” she explained. “The guitar is equal-opportunity. It’s a really comfortable guitar no matter your body size or shape, but including if you are small, or if you do have breasts — men have breasts.” “It’s an incredibly versatile guitar and I designed it with my own experience in mind,” she later added. She explained that the instrument is meant to be versatile, “both tone-wise and ergonomically,” for anyone who picks it up. She brings up a fair point, on the heels of a press round for her directorial debut in the horror anthology “XX.” Clark said she was asked about the experience of being a woman, specifically, in film — a line of questioning she’s answered ad infinitum as a musician. “I’ve spent a lot of time in my career side-stepping and unpacking the question of what’s it like to be a woman in music,” Clark said. Later, she added, “I will say that no one has ever asked a guy in film or [music] what its like to be a guy in [film or] music. I think, personally, I would rather talk about the ins and outs and the specificity of the craft and ideas than spend any more time with this particular question.” In this case, she’d rather talk about her guitar — and the fact that it’s accessible to a range of musicians. “I think the idea is to make a great tool for artists and to make a great tool that is friendly to play whether you’re just starting out or whether you’ve been playing for 30 years or more,” Clark said. And for those just starting out in the music world, Clark has this advice: “I just think it’s really important to know all aspects of your craft ... Find out what you can about engineering, and learn about frequencies, and be able to be the engineer or speak to engineers live and in studio. And just make things that you like. Not things that you think other people might like, but things that you like. And things that matter to you.”"
ARTS & CULTURE,Getting Older Is A Thing Of Beauty In These Portraits Of Centenarians Around The World,"The first centenarian ― or person over 100 ― that Karsten Thormaehlen photographed was his friend’s grandmother.  “I was impressed by her presence, her knowledge and liveliness,” Thormaehlen told The Huffington Post of the experience, which occurred in Berlin in 2006.  Thormaehlen’s been taking pictures of centenarians ever since. He reaches out to senior institutions, local newspapers and the tourists offices in the places that he travels.  “Most centenarians are well known in their communities, it proves life is worth living there,” Thormaehlen said.  The Internet also helps him seek out subjects, and helps subjects and their families find him. Recently, for example, he was contacted by someone from Russia, who shared photos of her grandfather, a WWII veteran who fought against the Nazis. Thormaehlen hopes that he can eventually take the man’s portrait and include him in future projects.  His current project, Aging Gracefully, is a photo book collecting the people he’s captured on camera. In one portrait, a French woman’s close-cropped crew cut feels like a contemporary look, but her necklace is timeless. In another, a Japanese woman grins, showing her stark-white teeth.  “The faces always reflect most of people’s character and somehow we think, we can read about their life in it,” Thormaehlen said. “An old face, with all its lines stimulates people’s minds and they start considering what kind of person they are looking at.” To emphasize each subject’s individual features, Thormaehlen made sure to home in closely and to rid the images of any background clutter.  “The readers should reflect and compare, and ask themselves what they can do for society if they are around for a few decades after retiring,” Thormaehlen said. “People should lose a bit of their fear about age and aging.” Check out more images from Aging Gracefully, published by Chronicle Books, below: CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article misidentified Thormaehlen’s gender.  "
ARTS & CULTURE,Artist Is Casually Spending The Week Living Inside A Giant Boulder,"On Feb. 22, French artist Abraham Poincheval moved into his temporary new home: a 12,000-kilogram (or 12-metric-ton) limestone boulder located inside Paris’s Palais de Tokyo art museum. He will reside there for a full week. The modest abode doesn’t offer much in terms of space. For his entire stay, Poincheval will sit in a Poincheval-shaped hole carved in the middle of the rock, his arms outstretched before him. Breathing holes have been punctured into the limestone, yet the artist will remain cloaked in darkness for the entirety of his stay, without knowledge of what time or day it is.  It’s all part of a performance piece (slash “mystical journey”) titled “Pierre,” which translates to “stone” in English. Over the course of the week, Poincheval ― whose work often revolves around intense challenges of confinement, isolation and meditation ― will detach from the human pace of life and learn to live at the speed of a mineral.  One of the less mystical aspects of the experience, however, is the fact that Poincheval, who will temporarily subsist on a diet of dried meat, cartons of soup and other liquids, has to pee in water bottles and store his excrement around him for the duration of his performance. In anticipation of the piece, Poincheval, 44, has been physically and mentally training for months. Yet how exactly the artist will react to the extreme conditions of his performance remains unknown. Thankfully, museum visitors will be able to keep the artist company, speaking to him through a crack in the middle of the rock. Poincheval will chronicle the emotional and logistical details of his rocky experience in a journal, explaining in very literal terms what it feels like to be the heart of a stone ― and basically entombed alive.  In an interview with The Guardian, Poincheval described his first days inhumed as comparable to a psychedelic trip. “It’s very complex,” he said. “You pass from one feeling to an another. Like you are being carried away on a raft. It’s like tripping. I am trying to explain (the feelings) in language but it very difficult to put down in black and white.” The artist has an emergency phone line in case of emergencies, though his prior performances suggest he’ll be just fine. In 2014, Poincheval took up residence inside the stomach of a dead bear for two weeks, where his diet consisted of worms and beetles. He’s also spent eight days buried under a rock, a week on top of a 65-foot pole, and 20 days underground as a human mole.  After “Stone,” Poincheval is moving on to an even stranger artistic pursuit, titled “Egg.” For this one, he will sit on a dozen eggs for between three and four weeks, with the hopes that they’ll hatch. “Pierre” runs from from Feb. 22 to March 1. “Egg” begins March 29 and will continue for a period of 21-26 days at the Palais de Tokyo, Paris."
ARTS & CULTURE,Seth Rogen Uses The Oscars To Reveal He's A Major 'Hamilton' Fan,"Lin-Manuel Miranda began his Oscar night tearing up while watching a prerecorded message from the cast of “Hamilton,” who performed a medley of his songs — including the Oscar-nominated “How Far I’ll Go” from “Moana.” It’d be fair for him to assume that would be the highlight of the night, but Seth Rogen gave that moment a run for its money. While presenting the award for Best Film Editing with Michael J. Fox, Rogen remarked, “I’m at the Oscars with Michael J. Fox, a DeLorean, and I’m wearing future shoes. All I have to do is sing the ‘Schuyler Sisters’ song from ‘Hamilton’ in front of the world, and I will have completed my entire bucket list.” Cue amazing, joyful reaction from Miranda: But Rogen didn’t stop there. “Look around, look around, at how lucky we are to be alive right now,” he sang — sounding just a bit different from the Broadway performers who play the Schuyler sisters in the musical. “Angelica ...” Rogen continued, clearly waiting for Fox to chime in. ”Eliza,” Fox added, making theater nerds worldwide squeal with delight. “And Peggy!” Rogen finished.  Let’s cut to Lin for another reaction: How lucky we are to be alive right now, indeed. Also, Seth: Hook us up with tickets? Please?  "
ARTS & CULTURE,Sage Elf Jaden Smith Is Leaving His Art On The Streets For Lucky Mortals To Find,"Los Angelinos, if you see a mediocre Basquiat knockoff lying around outside an art gallery, you may just be staring at an original Jaden Smith. The Twitter sage and planetary citizen has been leaving works of art outside for fans or confused randos to pick up. The first painting, an ominous black-and-white canvas reading “Will you die with me?” was claimed by very a brave fan named Kevin Doan on Feb. 23.  I Just Left My Art Piece Here, Come Get It. pic.twitter.com/Hqthfnc4iw A second painting, which Smith dropped outside a gallery in the San Fernando Valley suburb of Panorama City, seems to still be awaiting for its new owner. If that owner is you ― pics or it didn’t happen.  I left A Piece At Living Spaces In Van Nuys, I Hope You Enjoy It And Have A Good Day. pic.twitter.com/feovVGauZK Whoever Has It Take A Picture. Smith has been very, very, very, very vocal about his passion for the arts as of late. He recently attached himself to Shia LaBeouf’s ongoing, anti-Trump livestream “He Will Not Divide Us,” which was relocated to Albuquerque, New Mexico, following a chaotic run in New York. Jaden, you’re a strange and beautiful bird. Keep making art, keep leaving art, keep being art. "
ARTS & CULTURE,This Dance Inspired By 'Moonlight' Is Almost As Gorgeous As The Real Thing,"Critics have described Barry Jenkins’ “Moonlight” ― the stunning film awarded Best Picture at the Academy Awards on Sunday ― as a cinematic poem, in part because of its masterful score, stretches of silence, and piercing use of color.  A ballet-infused dance inspired by the motion picture, choreographed by Robert Battle of New York’s Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, distills the movie’s poetic essence into two minutes of ecstatic movement.  Under a blue luminosity reminiscent of the moon’s glare, dancers Jamar Roberts, Christopher Taylor and Jeremy T. Villas move to the film’s rapturous score, created by Academy Award-nominated composer Nicholas Britell.  The three dancers represent the film’s protagonist, Chiron, at various phases of his life ― childhood, adolescence and adulthood. Their bodies communicate Chiron’s struggle to understand and accept himself, trembling back and forth between expression and suppression without saying a word. In the video, directed by by Anna Rose Holmer of 2016’s “The Fits,” the dazzling blue light illuminates the dancing figures, their every facial expression and undulating muscle telling a unique story. Like the film, Holmer’s short revels in the sensuality and sensitivity of the dancers, qualities which are often overlooked in stereotypical depictions of black men. Bask in the glow of “Moonlight”s excellence over and over again with the video above, courtesy of Nowness. "
ARTS & CULTURE,These Emerging Artists Are More Than Ready To Defend The First Amendment,"“I love the First Amendment,” President Donald Trump proclaimed on Friday at the 2017 Conservative Political Action Conference. “Nobody loves it better than me,” he added. The effusive remark comes from the same person who called venerable media outlets like The New York Times and NBC News ― long considered pillars of the same free press protected by the First Amendment ― “the enemy of the American people.” Other phrases he and his staff have used to describe journalists prone to criticizing his administration: “out of control,” “opposition party,” “dishonest” and “fake news.” Weeks before Trump’s CPAC speech, curators at Ground Floor Gallery in New York City ― a space dedicated to emerging artists ― decided it was time for genuine First Amendment defenders to speak out. They began soliciting artwork for a show they called “Marked Urgent,” inviting artists to submit work “associated with any and all types of correspondence and communication.”  “Now, more than ever, we need to empower journalists to hold our government accountable and to provide us with the facts we need to remain informed and involved citizens,” the gallery wrote online. “As passionate arts professionals vested in critical thought and freedom of expression, we feel compelled to respond.” “Marked Urgent” opened on Friday, Feb. 24, the same day Trump chastised news outlets for using anonymous sources, despite having used them himself to make claims that have been proven false. The pieces on view at Ground Floor are on sale for $75, $25 of which will be donated to the Committee to Protect Journalists, “an independent, nonprofit organization that promotes press freedom worldwide” and defends “the right of journalists to report the news without fear of reprisal.” “We were thrilled that our artist network was just as enthusiastic about this concept as we were,” Ground Floor co-founders Krista Saunders Scenna and Jill Benson told The Huffington Post. “We received over 70 submissions in just under three weeks and selected 39 artists for the show,” they added. “With submissions ranging from embroidered newsprint to collaged envelopes and sculpted stationery, the work is as inventive as it is topical. All in all, it’s been an incredibly empowering show to organize and gratifying to know we can help an organization doing such important work every day.”  “Marked Urgent” will run through Sunday, Feb. 26. To see a full list of the participating artists, head to Ground Floor’s website here."
ARTS & CULTURE,"Finally, A Web Series That Navigates The Horrors Of Being A 'Woman Online’","In 2017, calling a web series about women’s experiences on the internet “Woman Online” is controversial, apparently. “I’ve already been criticized by men online for this web series,” said comedian Sara Schaefer in a recent phone conversation with The Huffington Post, explaining that some online users took issue with the name. “I’m not saying that other people don’t get harassed online, but this web series is about what it’s like to be a woman online. I’m sorry, that’s who I am and that’s what I’m talking about.” It’s a sentiment that likely many ladies on the internet could empathize with, given the frequent reports of gender-driven trolling women receive online. For example, a 2016 Australian study found that 76 percent of women under 30 experience online harassment. In the same year, writer Lindy West left Twitter after years of being the subject of harassment due to her work, calling the platform “unusable for anyone but trolls, robots and dictators.” That “Woman Online,” a project Schaefer created with Seriously.TV, reflects this current climate is no accident. The comedian, known for her 2013 MTV show “Nikki & Sara Live,” is fascinated by why people do what they do. As someone whose career is dependent on maintaining an online presence, Sara looked to the internet — and the specific experience of women in that space — as inspiration. “Social media is, for me personally, an overall positive,” she said, citing the ability of online platforms to spread messages of the marginalized and share different individuals’ experiences. After witnessing the dissemination of information surrounding the Ferguson, Missouri, protests after 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot by a white police officer, Schaefer saw the power of interacting online. “For me personally, it turned my brain on [to realize,] oh, my god, I can’t unsee this. And I can’t not be upset about it anymore.”  “Because of that, in some ways, we’re more sensitive ... Everything feels so close, and so big, because of social media,” she said. Of course, with great tweeting power comes great responsibility, and the democratization of information means, unfortunately, name-calling and threats are elevated to the same level as constructive discourse. Being a woman colors the whole experience in a different hue. ”Every man I know online could post the same thing I post and get completely different responses. There are a lot of gendered insults — cunt, bitch are big ones — that people don’t really say to men. There’s a reason for that,” said Schaefer. “You know, women have been somewhat marginalized for all of history and again, social media has allowed us a platform to be louder and more unified. That’s scary to some people,” she continued. “I think there are a lot of women who are targeted because they are just speaking.” The number of stories Schaefer’s found from women led her to want to talk about these issues, well, online. Recent episodes include “What really happens in secret lady Facebook groups?” and “Inside a woman’s dating app.” While occasionally she’s brought on guests, like fellow comedian Jen Kirkman, the series’ most recent episode showcased Schaefer’s own journey to chase down a particularly persistent troll. She begins by reciting some things she’s had said to her on the internet: “Don’t listen to this dumb bitch, she’s barely a comedian.” “This chick’s husband needs to put her back in her place.” She goes on to tell the story of “Jeff,” a man who created numerous accounts to harass her in various ways, escalating to comments about Schaefer’s mother, who had passed away.  It’s clear that the directive women sometimes receive to “not feed the trolls” wouldn’t cut it in this situation. “Imagine if someone at your work was leaving anonymous notes taunting you about the worst thing that’s ever happened to you,” she says in the video. “Nobody would be like, ‘Oh, just ignore it! They just want attention!”  “On one hand, there’s nothing you can do to prevent [it],” Schaefer explained to me in our conversation. “It’s like telling someone to not go outside if they don’t wanna get mugged, you know? It’s like, well that’s just ridiculous. I have to be able to live my life,” she said. Each video strikes a blend of education and comedy. “Humor is so powerful,” Schaefer said, noting that it’s an effective way to “communicate the craziness of our world,” especially in a time when fake news, the normalization of hateful speech and strong divisions in politics have taken center stage. “My feeling now is that comedy is an important way to speak truth to power and hold up a mirror to things,” she said. “Not just against Trump, but against hypocrisy, and forcing people on both sides and in the middle to question how things are going.”"
ARTS & CULTURE,New Podcast To Explore Richard Simmons' Disappearance From The Public Eye,"“In February of 2014, Richard Simmons ghosted the world.” The words of filmmaker Dan Taberski, host of the new podcast “Missing Richard Simmons,” deftly sum up the mysterious radio silence from the effervescent fitness guru, as well as the impetus for Taberski’s audio project: a weekly podcast series in which he aims to connect once more with the “Sweatin’ to the Oldies” icon. What makes this venture more than just a news investigation is Taberski’s personal investment in the project. He was once a friend to Simmons, and a regular at the 68-year-old’s long-running exercise class in his Los Angeles studio Slimmons. Rumors swirled in 2016 that Simmons was being held hostage in his Hollywood home after two years had gone by without a peep from the typically extroverted celebrity. The news caused a stir, leading Simmons to assure fans that he was not in danger with a Facebook post on his personal page. The page is regularly updated in a cheery voice, encouraging followers to keep their spirits up and think healthy. Yet, listening to the podcast, we learn that everyone from decadeslong attendees of his class to close friends to fans across the country who leaned on him for support had long stopped hearing from Simmons. Taberski dutifully chronicles the many mysterious ways Simmons cut himself off from the public, even installing a security fence around the home where he once happily perched, waiting for vans of tourists looking for a famous face.  The stories from the fans and friends paint a clear picture of the impact Simmons had long after his workout tapes became a VCR staple and the shockwaves his absence has left. Through these interviews, the podcast becomes a meditation on public figures, their obligation to their fans, and whether one can truly disappear. Who knows where Taberski’s investigation will lead — could an audio plea and renewed widespread interest in the star be the thing to lure him out once more? — but the journey is fascinating thus far.

ARTS & CULTURE,Art Museums Provide Safe Spaces For Trans Students Across The Country,"For HuffPost’s #LoveTakesAction series, we’re telling stories of how people are standing up to hate and supporting those most threatened. What will you stand up for? Tell us with #LoveTakesAction. Not long after President /www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/donald-trump"",""lnid"":""Donald Trump""}}"">Donald Trump’s administration announced on Wednesday that it will no longer stop schools from discriminating against transgender students ― rescinding a policy put in place by former President Barack Obama’s administration ― the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota, posted a powerful image on Instagram. The photo, a simple shot of its all-gender restroom logo, was accompanied by a caption that reads: “All Genders Welcome.”  As students like Gavin Grimm, a transgender teen in Virginia who sued his school for the right to use the boys bathroom, fight to have access to the restroom consistent with their gender identity, the Walker’s Instagram post is a quiet reminder of how inclusivity can take shape functionally in public spaces. The Walker is but one of several museums, including the Whitney Museum of American Art, the American Folk Art Museum and the Chicago Children’s Museum, that have opted to make a seemingly small but effective gesture toward providing safe and inclusive spaces within its walls.  In 2014, the Whitney announced its move to include all-gender restrooms in its galleries, writing online that the decision came out of a discussion on museums as safe spaces that took place at the LGBT Community Center on West 13th Street in New York City. Quoting artist Gordon Hall of the Center for Experimental Lectures, they wrote: “The arts have long been a home for individuals who may not find support in the culture at large, and have served as a harbinger of broad social changes. The Whitney’s visitors, artists, and staff represent a wide range of gender identities and expressions, and this change will help make the Museum a welcoming space for us.” The 2016 edition of TrendsWatch, issued by the Center for the Future of Museums (CFM), part of the American Alliance of Museums, reiterated the importance of all-gender restrooms, encouraging museums not already doing so to “take a fresh look at their own environment and the overt and subtle signals they might send about the categories in which they place visitors, potentially signaling who is welcome and not welcome.” According to The New York Times, “all-gender” is the preferred terminology when it comes to inclusive restrooms. “To me, saying gender-neutral is like saying colorblind,” the Stonewall Center’s Genny Beemyn told the Times. “We see gender. To deny it is to deny people’s reality. We’re trying to increase recognition of the diversity of gender rather than to erase it.” Smaller institutions like the Jewett Arts Center and Worcester Art Museum in Massachusetts, the Regina Miller Gallery in Pennsylvania, and the Doty Fine Arts Building in Texas, have publicized moves toward all-gender restrooms, too. (The Utah Museum of Fine Arts opts for “gender-neutral.”) Of course, some museums still have a long way to go when it comes to cultivating comprehensively inclusive spaces. While TrendsWatch 2016 outlines concrete steps institutions can take in terms of all-gender bathrooms, it is a far from perfect model for trans inclusion as a whole, Margaret Middleton, an exhibit designer and queer advocate, told The Huffington Post.  “Providing gender-inclusive restrooms is certainly a step in the right direction but museums shouldn’t stop there,” Middleton explained. “The whole museum needs to be considered ― including visitor services, exhibits and programs, and staff policy. For example, a visitor should be able to buy a membership using a name other than what is on their legal ID; there should be work by trans artists in the galleries; and non-discrimination hiring statements should include gender identity and gender expression. Becoming more trans-inclusive is a process. There is always more that can be done.” Ahead of its decision to rescind Obama-era policy on discrimination, Trump’s administration characterized transgender rights as “a states’ rights issue and not one for the federal government.” Going forward, the onus of change may fall on individual institutions like museums to continue advocating for basic protections and to recognize the role they play in educating their visitors ― whether it’s using a canvas or not. If recent efforts by museums to combat some of Trump’s discriminatory and ill-advised orders are any indication ― see: the Museum of Modern Art, the Museum of the City of New York, the Davis Museum at Wellesley College, the Metropolitan Museum of Art ― we should expect art institutions to play a big role in activism to come.

ARTS & CULTURE,Oscar Isaac To Play Title Role In New York Production Of 'Hamlet',"Shakespearean tragedy has never made us feel so giddy.  The New York Times reports that Oscar Isaac is slated to play the title role in director Sam Gold’s upcoming production of “Hamlet.” The highly anticipated staging will run at New York’s Public Theater from June 20 to Sept. 3, 2017.  Gold, who won a Tony for his direction of Broadway’s “Fun Home,” began work on the production in 2014, which was expected to run this year at Theater for a New Audience’s Polonsky Shakespeare Center in Brooklyn. Because of artistic differences, however, between Gold and artistic director Jeffrey Horowitz, the show was pulled in June 2016.  Now, the play, having controversially switched venues and artistic directors, is officially back on the docket. And we could picture few people better than Mr. Llewyn Davis himself to play the brooding, emo lead.  Oh, and one more bonus: Horatio will be played by Keegan-Michael Key, of “Key and Peele,” in his first New York stage performance. According to Slate, however, Key was classically trained as a Shakespearean actor before veering into improv comedy, so our expectations are pretty high.  Tickets will go on sale for Public members on March 9, with non-member tickets available at an unspecified later date.

ARTS & CULTURE,"A Free, Lady-Led Zine Is Here To School You On Reproductive Rights","It’s 2017 and, sadly, the question of whether women should be trusted to make decisions regarding their own bodies is still up for debate. With a new administration threatening to roll back rights for women and LGBTQ communities, it is crucial for people of all ages, genders and origins to know what they are legally entitled to when it comes to sexuality and reproductive health.  With “Repro Rights Zine,” activists India Menuez, Layla Alter and Emma Holland hope to do just that. Their downloadable feminist zine aims to provide information and empowerment in this alarming time ― for free. Following in the radical tradition of DIY zines, the mission of the publication is threefold: inform others about the current state of reproductive rights, warn them of what is at risk over the next four years, and list the precautions that can be taken to protect ourselves and each other. Oh, and share some quality feminist art. “The framing of these issues is really key,” Holland explained in an interview with i-D, “and this is where awareness changes a lot across the country. In general, this country still — for some insane reason — hasn’t accepted and institutionalized the idea of health as a basic human right. This is obvious in the way our healthcare system functions (or doesn’t) and its fundamental exploitative nature, particularly towards anyone who isn’t a white male with ample means.” ”When it comes to reproductive rights,” she continued, “the conversation often skews even further away from the idea of them as a right to health and safety and control over your own existence. And that’s if there’s a conversation at all. Doing this has made us even more aware of the lack of knowledge around these issues, even in our immediate communities.” Repro Rights Zine offers information on how to get an IUD, reproductive rights for trans and gender-nonconforming individuals, who to call to help protect the Affordable Care Act, and where to find the specifics of reproductive rights state-by-state.  The first edition of the zine, published shortly before Trump’s inauguration, is available for free download on the Repro Rights Zine website. The goal is, with the help of social media, to get the reading material to anyone and everyone who might benefit from its contents, from a middle school girl in conservative Texas to a non-binary, queer teen in Middle America.  For the second edition, the zine-masters enlisted artists Petra Collins, Meriem Bennani, Lola Ogbara, Ser Serpas, Alia Penner, Aidan Koch and Raina Hamner to create limited edition posters to stick inside the zines. These special artist editions sell for $20 each, with all proceeds going to the Center for Reproductive Rights. We reached out to contributing artist Ogbara to learn more.  How did you get involved with Repro Rights Zine? What stood out to you about the publication, in relation to other material on women’s sexual health?  I was approached by India Menuez. She sought me out via Instagram and emailed me about the project. I think what stood out the most for me was the way the Repro Rights Zine, compared to other publications, took on a strong political stance on the subject of women’s reproductive issues while simultaneously being current, timely and relatable. What can art teach women about reproductive rights and health that writing or scientific data cannot?  I think there’s an important difference in the way we are learning and going about obtaining information. Art compared to scientific data/writing is more visual and, in today’s world, having a visual of anything grabs the attention of the masses. I think people, in general, are seeing the importance of art more and more each day. Hopefully when realizing that, women will take their reproductive health and rights more seriously. What better way to approach learning than through art?  Who, in your opinion, is this zine meant for? I believe this zine is for anyone and everyone. Reproductive rights not only affect women but a whole family. It’s something everyone should be able to understand. The more we understand the more we can make strides toward progress. Can you talk about the work you contributed to the artist edition? Was this something you made specifically for the zine or decided to submit? What are you hoping to communicate through the piece?  I had been working on a uterus drawing a few weeks back that I never finished and had been sitting in a folder on my computer. When the opportunity to create something outside my own personal interest came, specifically something with purpose, that’s when I thought of the drawing I had done. I revisited the drawing, added to it and expanded it. I aimed for a vintage psychedelic poster aesthetic and used simple line work to achieve it. I connected with the early 1960s and ‘70s era because that era birthed a more radical political stance on women’s rights. It was seen as the second wave of feminism. I wanted to send a message that was bold but clear from the beginning of the movement [1920s] to now. Nothing has changed — our bodies, our decisions.   In your artist statement you write: “I gravitate towards a more literal and abstract functionality of the female aesthetic.” Can you expand upon what you mean by that?  I work in multiple mediums — whether it’s drawing, sculpture or painting, my undertones tend to concentrate on the female form, aesthetic, or way of life. It could be as literal as a drawing of a female figure or more subtle and abstract as in my paintings using delicate shapes and certain color palettes. However we are functioning and evolving in today’s society, I am a storyteller of that process. How does the political climate we’re in right now shape your ideas regarding the efficacy of art activism?  My art has always had a purpose; an activism rooted in any adversity I felt connected to. As a black woman living in America, there will always be some type of adversity for me so I will always feel inspired to express that. I think our current political standing expands to a demographic of artists that may not have been affected before and, as a result, more artists are participating in this new wave of art activism. To reach any change, I think it’s necessary that art activism grows to help make society better for everyone.  What is one thing you wish everyone knew in terms of women’s health and reproductive rights? It’s not just an issue for women, it’s an issue for everyone. The idea that If you educate a man, you educate an individual; but if you educate a woman, you educate a family (nation) — applies to this situation, as well. If you tend to a woman, you tend to the family (nation).   Download a free copy of Repro Rights Zine here and purchase an artist edition here. "
ARTS & CULTURE,Artist's Inspiring National Anthem Performance Is A Literal Work Of Art,"You’ve probably never seen the national anthem performed like this before.  Artist Joe Everson did more than sing “The Star-Spangled Banner” at the University of Arkansas men’s basketball game this week. He painted throughout the entire song, with a very impressive reveal at the end.  Everson has made headlines for his national anthem displays in the past. In October, Everson showed off his skills ahead of an ECHL hockey game. Fans of the artist can view more of his paintings and photography on his website, which includes a section dedicated to his national anthem performances. “With a few lines I can say so much. That’s where art comes to life for me,” Everson says on his website. His original rendition of “The Star-Spangled Banner” may be the best example of the artist’s philosophy.  Check out the performance in the video above."
ARTS & CULTURE,Mural Shows 37 Real And Repulsive Things Politicians Have Said About Women,"The time to remain silent about misogyny and discrimination is over. As artist /www.zoebuckman.com/"",""lnid"":""Zoë Buckman""}}"">Zoë Buckman told The Huffington Post: “We all have a responsibility to act now.” Buckman joined forces with fellow feminist artist /www.natalie-frank.com/"",""lnid"":""Natalie Frank""}}"">Natalie Frank to call out some of the real and entirely repulsive statements said by politicians about women and their bodies, in a painful yet necessary project called “We Hold These Truths To Be Self-Evident.”  The artists were inspired to do something about the rampant sexism that has long plagued politics after President Donald Trump’s comments about grabbing women “by the pussy” surfaced. “Women have been so traumatized about the language Trump used,” Frank told The Huffington Post, “the way he talks about sexual violence, the way he mocks it.” Unfortunately, Trump is far from the first elected official to make shameful and abhorrent comments about women’s rights and health. Frank and Buckman resolved to unearth some of the most heinous comments and share them with the public. The mural is now on view for all to see, in the Ford Foundation Live Gallery at New York Live Arts.  “Researching the quotes was tough, emotionally,” Buckman said. “Seeing these words typed out, reading sentiment after sentiment of disrespect and hatred, the preposterous absence of science, fact, or reality, the utter lack of compassion, and the blatant misogyny: It’s blindingly clear that there is a war on women right now and that there always has been.” The mural includes quotes by both liberal and conservative politicians, including Mike Pence, Ben Carson, Bill Clinton and Rick Santorum. The first quote, credited to former Wisconsin State Assembly member Roger Rivard, reads: “Some girls, they rape so easy.” The statements are projected atop an image of a group of older white men gathered around a table. Atop the mantle sits a painting of a nude odalisque, referencing the long history of objectification aimed at women’s bodies, both in politics and art.  “It hasn’t been 100 years since women got the right to vote,” Frank added. “There is a real fragility there, and a gravity to women taking a stand for themselves and their rights. If there is anything this election has shown us [it’s that] the things we take for granted can be wiped out.” “We Hold These Truths To Be Self-Evident” is now on view in the Ford Foundation Live Gallery at New York Live Arts, and will be up throughout the spring season. "
ARTS & CULTURE,"This Feminist Film Got Snubbed By The Oscars, But You Should Watch It Anyway","When we meet Dorothea ― the heroine of Mike Mills’ film “20th Century Women,” a 50-something mom played by Annette Bening ― it’s hard to know what to make of her. She’s not trying to make it big in Hollywood. She’s not trying to hunt down her rapist, or plan the perfect event to solidify her husband’s place in history. Her goals are less concrete than that, her successes less triumphant. And that could be why both Bening and Mills were snubbed this year at the Oscars, for Best Actress and Best Picture, respectively. The film opens with a shot of Dorothea’s immolated car, the last remnant of her failed marriage. It’s so old that it’s finally combusted, but she doesn’t mind. She laughs it off, and invites the fireman who’s come to her aide over for dinner, to her teenage son Jamie’s chagrin. Over the course of the film, we get to know her through her quirky habits, as narrated by Jamie. She’s generous, and lets Abbie (Greta Gerwig), a 20-something photographer battling cervical cancer, stay in her Santa Barbara home without always making rent. She’s old-fashioned and isn’t appreciative of Abbie’s menstruation talk at the dinner table. But she also knows the limits of her ‘50s convictions in a late ‘70s, punk-rock world. Realizing that she’s struggling to communicate with her son, she enlists Abbie and Jamie’s best friend Julie (Elle Fanning) to help raise him. “How do you be a good man?” she wonders. “I don’t know how you do that nowadays.” The film, to its credit, is both about Bening’s loosening off of domestic shackles and her attempt to raise a young man who’s a feminist ally, in the throes of the movement’s second wave. The latter storyline garnered criticism; why tell a feminist story through the lens of a boy? A review in the Village Voice observes that Mills’ references to Our Bodies, Ourselves and Sisterhood is Powerful feel “awkwardly exploited, inserted to salute not so much Jamie’s advisers — those first female readers — as the teenager himself.” It’s a thorny premise, certainly, especially when women’s stories are still undermined onscreen. But the movie, while told from Jamie’s point of view, belongs to Dorothea, and Bening, who outshines an impressive cast. It’s unlikely that the movie’s less progressive conception was its downfall in the eyes of the Academy, which has been criticized for favoring the narratives of those with power to those without it (lest we forget #OscarsSoWhite). But it wouldn’t be a jump to think that “20th Century Women” was overlooked due to what some critics count as its strength: it’s a mood piece, not a high-volume, crescendoing drama or musical. Compared with most of the films that did manage to secure Best Picture nominations — “La La Land,” “Manchester by the Sea,” “Hacksaw Ridge,” “Hidden Figures” — its plot is subdued, and at times meandering. Abbie gets involved with one of Dorothea’s other boarders; Jamie gets into David Byrne and his attendant subversiveness; Julie challenges her parents’ oppressive psychologizing. Dinner parties are had. A lot happens, but the stakes are low. Compare this with the Best Picture winners from the past few years ― “Spotlight,” “Argo,” “The King’s Speech,” “Slumdog Millionaire” and “The Departed,” especially ― and there’s a marked difference. Those movies are highly dramatized; Mills’ is anything but. Like his earlier movies, “Thumbsucker” and “Beginners,” “20th Century Women” is an autobiographical reflection of the director’s upbringing. Snapshots of cultural hallmarks and pastiche are woven into his stories like projector slides, an effect some critics find authentic, and others find gratuitously twee. No matter which side you fall on, it’s evident that Mills’ storytelling techniques neatly match the stories he sets out to tell. He’s not guilty of the Sofia Coppola-like tendency to shroud every scene, regardless of its subject matter, in diffuse light. Instead, he uses meandering, character-centered plots to heighten a sense of ennui, which Dorothea, who came of age in the ‘40s, suffers from. Like Hal in “Beginners,” a suburban father who only feels free to come out as gay after his wife dies, Dorothea is the product of a stifling time when gender roles were expected to be assumed.  To place her in a spacious story, one where she’s free to take up new hobbies, to make wry jokes, is an act of love. It also happens to be an entertaining experience for the viewer; Dorothea does have obstacles to overcome, namely casting off her own social conditioning. And that ― still, today ― is one of the most relatable conflicts there is. You can be highbrow. You can be lowbrow. But can you ever just be brow?

ARTS & CULTURE,Yayoi Kusama's 'Infinity Rooms' Are Here To Turn Your Instagram Feed Into Art,"Throughout her 70-year career, Japanese artist and almighty priestess of polka dots Yayoi Kusama has created a series of rooms ― mirrored, enclosed spaces that use water, twinkly lights, bespeckled balloons, soft phallic sculptures and pumpkins ― to prompt viewers to contemplate the idea of the infinite universe. And, from what we’ve gleaned, the infinite universe is very photogenic.  On Friday, Feb. 24, the stunning traveling exhibition “Yayoi Kusama: Infinity Mirrors” opens at the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington, D.C., featuring six of Kusama’s iconic, infinite spaces.  Viewers are encouraged to enter each space alone, with approximately 45 seconds to take it in once inside. It’s probably a smart idea to sign up for free, timed passes to minimize time spent waiting in lines ― the exhibition is expected to be a blockbuster.  Since you won’t have boundless time to photograph yourself in the seemingly boundless spaces, you’d be wise to head into the rooms ready to take in the work and take a photo in an expedient manner. And know this: snapping a selfie in the dizzying space is not disrespectful toward Kusama’s mission. In fact, a photo is a simple way to harness the spirit of her rooms ― by multiplying yourself, immersing yourself in your environment, and becoming an infinite image yourself.  Stay tuned for our full review of the exhibition. In the meantime, take a digital walk through the show below, and read more about the exhibition here. "
ARTS & CULTURE,A Previously Unknown Walt Whitman Novella Was Discovered -- And It's Not Great,"Many great writers are haunted by mediocre or pulpy works of fiction from their early years, and Walt Whitman is no exception. Thanks to his poetry, most notably his lifelong work-in-progress Leaves of Grass, Whitman is remembered as a free-spirited, innovative poet and Transcendentalist. On Monday, however, a serialized novella he published anonymously in 1852 was revealed to the public. The story, which was originally published in six parts in a New York newspaper, was unearthed by Zachary Turpin, a graduate student at the University of Houston. Turpin had previously discovered a health tract by Whitman, “Manly Health and Training,” which many news outlets considered evidence that Whitman promoted a Paleo diet. (Not quite, but he did advocate eating a lot of meat, in addition to wearing athletic shoes and avoiding stress.) The newly surfaced story, “Life and Adventures of Jack Engle: An Auto-Biography,” tells the story of its young hero’s exploits in New York City. The short novel is fairly classic fare for the time, starring a likable, orphaned young man making his way amongst an urban environment peopled with devious characters and seductive women. It also trades comfortably in problematic archetypes: A lawyer is crooked, a casino is run by a Jewish woman with a “hooked nose” and her flirtatious daughter, a beautiful Spanish dancer possesses a heart of gold but a disreputable profession. Despite our idealized visions of Whitman the iconoclastic poet, it’s long been known that he harbored certain racially troubling views common at the time. Nonetheless, his stereotypical characters in “Jack Engle” are mostly drawn with some warmth and generosity, rather than disdain. Still, as reviews of the work have pointed out, it’s not exactly good. Although it boasts lyrical passages that scholars have said are reminiscent of Leaves of Grass (first published in 1855), those gems are embedded in a clunky, standard-issue Dickensian narrative jammed with extraordinary coincidences and twists. Whitman probably agreed, later writing of several other works of juvenilia he nonetheless included in an anthology, “My serious wish were to have all those crude and boyish pieces quietly dropp’d in oblivion.” But hey, judge for yourself: You can check out the full text of the novella online."
ARTS & CULTURE,Met Director Fears Elimination Of NEA Marks 'New Assault' On Art,"In an impassioned (but not quite scorched-earth) op-ed for The New York Times, Metropolitan Museum of Art director Thomas P. Campbell issued a swift and effective defense of public art in the United States.  “Arts and cultural programming challenges, provokes and entertains; it enhances our lives,” he wrote. “Eliminating the NEA would in essence eliminate investment by the American government in the curiosity and intelligence of its citizens.” His defense ― a paean to the National Endowment of the Arts, in particular ― comes after rumors-turned-reports alleged that President Donald Trump’s administration plans to slash arts funding in an attempt to cut down on domestic spending. “Eliminating arts funding programs will save Donald Trump just 0.0625% of budget,” outlets have claimed. Nonetheless, it appears as though his office is ready to eliminate nine programs, including the NEA. Campbell anticipates that regions around the country, not just those within walking distance of the Met, will feel the loss of such an institution. NEA grants are awarded to schools, jazz festivals, dance troupes, literary organizations, museum exhibitions, “arts programs for war veterans,” and so much more across every U.S. congressional district, Campbell claims. In fact, you can get an idea of the NEA’s scope of influence here, courtesy of a website created by artist Tega Brain. Grants are small ― they average $26,000, Campbell says, and require groups to secure matching funds ― but they can be powerful. “Thousands are distributed in all 50 states, reaching every congressional district, urban and rural, rich and poor,” Campbell added, countering the Heritage Foundation’s characterization of the NEA as “welfare for cultural elitists.” “These grants sustain the arts in areas where people don’t have access to major institutions like the Met.” Contained within Campbell’s poetic defense is also an admission of concern: “I fear that this current call to abolish the NEA is the beginning of a new assault on artistic activity,” he proclaimed, harkening back to the last time publicly-funded art was under threat. In the 1990s, a congressional “decency test” turned lawmakers into wayward art critics capable of vetoing grants to expecting artists who didn’t meet Congress’ moral standards. Think artists like the NEA Four. Or, in the late 1980s, Robert Mapplethorpe, Dread Scott and Andres Serrano. Campbell continued: Eliminating the NEA would in essence eliminate investment by the American government in the curiosity and intelligence of its citizens. As the planet becomes at once smaller and more complex, the public needs a vital arts scene, one that will inspire us to understand who we are and how we got here — and one that will help us to see other countries, like China, not as enemies in a mercenary trade war but as partners in a complicated world. Campbell is hardly the only person to bridle at the prospect of decreased national arts funding. Authors, actors and artists, in particular, have been vocal about the need to protect the NEA and similar institutions. PEN America launched a petition to support the NEA; a White House petition with similar aims erupted. #DefendingNationalEndowmentForArts  Unfortunately the only art our demagogue minority-pres. would champion is an Art who'd voted for him. Why would he like the NEA? The only art he likes is a painting of himself  he buys with money he embezzled from his charitable foundation. https://t.co/53MbGPWmER I paraphrase but, 'One can judge a civilization by the value it places on its Art.' Do not defund the #NEA. As writer Celeste Pewter noted in a comprehensive Twitter thread, any proposed cuts to the NEA or similar programs would depend on Congressional budgets and appropriation. Similarly, in a thorough examination for The Huffington Post, reporter Claire Fallon outlined six things NEA supporters can do to protect national arts funding before an official decision to defund is made. In the meantime, it will be important for figures like Campbell to continue to step forward and effectively communicate the impact and reach of the NEA. To tell the stories that accurately reflect how arts funding touches not only the coasts, but heartland organizations. To eloquently explain the ways in which art can transform opinions and illuminate the other.  In the face of a president who seems willing to cut budgetary corners he might not fully understand, it’s worth remembering the words of a former president, Barack Obama, who said, “Equal to the impact [artists] have on each of us every day as individuals is the impact [they] have on us as a society. And we are told we’re divided as a people, and then suddenly the arts have this power to bring us together and speak to our common condition.”"
ARTS & CULTURE,Fourth-Generation Harlem Artist Challenges What It Means To Be An American,"In artist David Shrobe’s multimedia work “Guerrilla Tactics,” the edge of a gold picture frame knocks up against a curved slice of mosaic nestled near an emerald-colored plastic crate. A triangular slab of shopping cart hovers atop them. They’re materials you might find piled high in your attic or garage, and pay them little heed. Through Shrobe’s practice, however, the domestic materials are chopped up, rearranged and reincarnated, forming an unlikely canvas. A ghostly figure hovers atop the amassed materials, his or her invisible face demarcated by a frilly collar and decadent cape. The image of old fashioned nobility is shoved up against the stuff of modern-day detritus, forming a hybrid image that’s hard to place, but harder to shake. “I’ve been collecting objects from in and around my family’s home in Harlem for many years,” Shrobe, a fourth-generation Harlem resident, wrote in an email to The Huffington Post. “Sometimes they make it into a work, sometimes they sit in the studio for months or years before I find their purpose. I’m often drawn to things that speak to a sense of home, things that are commonplace in our communities. They say a lot about us, from social status to the things we consume and the environments we live in.”  In his exhibition “Homegrown,” which recently closed at Thierry Goldberg Gallery, Shrobe fuses his found materials into portraits that feel over-crowded and otherworldly. The artists responds to the elitist and exclusive tradition of classical portraiture with a visual display of texture, heterogeneity and abundance, offering an alternative to portraiture’s elitist roots and singular perspective.  With the show’s title, Shrobe hopes to address the current political climate, raising the question of who is deemed a “true American” and why. “It came from questioning ideas about our nationalism and what it means to belong to one’s country or home, and the ways I see that being challenged, both now and throughout history,” he said. “It also speaks to ideas about consumption and domesticity and having a connection to the materials I find.” Shrobe invites these materials, including clocks and mirrors and doorknobs and ceiling tins, to speak for themselves, allowing viewers to connect to and identify with them as they please. Through literally slicing up traditions of portraiture and rebuilding them anew, he makes space for a new kind of identity, which embraces multiplicity down to its core.  “As a painter, I am always pushing my affinity for painting and interested in what painting can be and how it can function in this contemporary moment,” Shrobe said. “Collapsing divisions between past, present and future gives birth to fragmented portraits, mythological beings and hybridized forms who are not oriented to a specific time or place, but rather floating in a space of disquieting coexistence.” Shrobe’s work, reminiscent of contemporary artist Titus Kaphar, offers a new model for representation, one that acknowledges the complexity and brokenness of its subjects. The images are especially resonant in this day and age, when complex and composite identities are under threat.  “For me,” Shrobe said, “it’s about asking questions through the materials I use and creating new meaning from the histories that are inherent in the images and objects I reposition and the art historical canon from which I borrow and bring into a new context ― that of my own. To create spaces within which new forms and mixtures become indigenized; figures imbued with a sense of heroism and who embrace their humanity, while challenging what it means to be an American in these turbulent times.”"
ARTS & CULTURE,Milo Yiannopoulos’ Canceled Book Is A Lesson In Battling Hate Speech,"When Milo Yiannopoulos posted on Facebook Monday night that his book deal with Simon & Schuster had been canceled, his tone wasn’t concerned, but matter-of-fact.  “They canceled my book,” he wrote in a post that got over 6,000 shares. In another post, which got over 8,000 responses as of writing this piece, he wrote, “I’ve gone through worse. This will not defeat me.” He’s probably right.  It took a lot ― too much, many argued ― for Simon & Schuster to cut its losses with Dangerous, which was slated to come out in March, but was later pushed back to a June release date. Prior to the $250,000 deal, Yiannopoulos had been banned from Twitter and widely condemned for his inflammatory, trollish comments about women, people of color, transgender individuals and Muslims. After the deal was announced, fellow publishers aired their concern, and Roxane Gay, whose book How to Be Heard was set to come out with Simon & Schuster, withdrew her contract. The shameful takeaway from the Milo story is S&S lied. It was never about free speech. Otherwise, why cancel because of something he said? Simon & Schuster originally stood by its decision to publish Yiannopoulos, a move that was bolstered by the National Coalition Against Censorship, which wrote in a statement last month, “the suppression of noxious ideas does not defeat them; only vigorous disagreement can counter toxic speech effectively.”  It’s a just concept in theory, but in practice, one person’s voice is capable of undermining or outright silencing countless others’, on social media and beyond. And, while hateful language aimed at disenfranchised groups can’t be policed by the government, it can be removed of its platform. Which is what happened yesterday after Yiannopoulos made a comment condoning pedophilia, an act apparently beyond the boundaries of alt-right acceptability. He was subsequently uninvited to next week’s Conservative Political Action Conference; a publicist at Simon & Schuster announced the deal decision shortly after. Right now, no comment has been issued about whether Yiannopoulos will hold onto his advance.  Still, Yiannopoulos is right that an axed memoir deal doesn’t mean he’s done telling his story.  There isn’t much precedent for book contracts canceled due to public backlash, but the best-known case points to the possibility of a new deal being struck. In 2006, O.J. Simpson’s ghostwritten book If I Did It, which detailed how he would have hypothetically committed the murders of his ex-wife and her friend, was yanked from HarperCollins’ list after criticism. The rights to the title were then bought by the family of Ronald Goldman, whose theoretical murder was described in its pages. The book was eventually published by Beaufort Books, with commentary contextualizing its original content. In a more likely scenario, Yiannopoulos could self-publish Dangerous, a move that could at least bring him success in terms of units sold, with his committed fan base and recent uptick in notoriety. A Google trends search for his name shows a big spike since his book deal and the subsequent controversies. And, he’s not a stranger to the publishing model; before this deal, he self-published two books of poetry, which both have high star ratings on Amazon.  Still, the end goal ― or at least the end result ― for many self-published hits is a contract with a publisher. Both Fifty Shades of Grey and The Martian started out that way, later securing deals with Penguin Random House imprints.  Reverting to the grassroots method of story promotion after securing a publishing contract could be considered a step backwards in terms of legitimacy ― and legitimacy, plus a more mainstream platform, seem to be what Yiannopoulos craves. (Comparisons to Trump are ripe for picking.) As a Simon & Schuster author, Yiannopoulos’ name could have been grouped with Bob Woodward’s, Hillary Clinton’s and Stephen King’s. Make no mistake: its ultimate removal from that list is the result of protest, not conscientiousness on the publisher’s part. But now, no matter how his story is disseminated, it is, for the time being, on the fringe of public consumption. So, contrary to the NCAC’s statement, voicing concern doesn’t have to be the only ethical, constitutional method for combating hate speech. Publishers have the right ― and arguably the responsibility ― to determine what’s a bigger impediment to free speech: fostering authors with oppressive views or refusing to publish them. "
ARTS & CULTURE,The One Book You Need To Read To Understand The Plight Of Refugees,"The Refugees, Viet Thanh Nguyen’s fiction follow-up to his acclaimed debut novel, The Sympathizer, would be critically praised at any historical moment. But, as it happens, it arrived at this one: Just a couple short weeks after President Donald Trump signed an executive order that brought the U.S. refugee program to a screeching pause and indefinitely barred Syrian refugees from entering the country. The collection, dedicated “For all refugees, everywhere,” is a compilation of nine haunting stories that follow the lives of refugees and their children, reflecting on how they process the trauma they’ve suffered and cling to fingerholds in both the old world and the new. As the swell of coverage suggests, it’s the perfect book to read at this historical moment in America, when a massive global refugee crisis is colliding with a government’s resistance to accepting them into the country.  “We need to understand how refugees are different [from immigrants] so that we don’t erase the specificity of their experience,” Nguyen recently told BuzzFeed’s Doree Shafrir. Instead of choosing to leave their homeland to pursue a different life, refugees have fled a home where it’s no longer possible to live safely. Their home, as they remember it, probably doesn’t really exist anymore. Simply staying, or even going back to visit, may not be viable options. In The Refugees, characters are tormented by loved ones lost in the conflict that drove them to flee, sacrifices made to bring them to a safer place, and the distance of a homeland left under duress. The refugees are drawn with the kind of affectionate warmth that’s frank about flaws but accepting of the whole. Even the most nominally comfortable refugees in Nguyen’s stories are nursing deep wounds. In the first story, a Vietnamese woman who fled with her family as a girl now makes a living ghostwriting for people having their 15 minutes of fame. She lives alone with her mother, but one day, someone unexpected arrives: her brother, who died 25 years ago during their escape. “You died too,” her brother’s ghost tells her. “You just don’t know it.” Wracked with guilt over her brother’s death, she’s become a husk, a vehicle for the stories of other people. Becoming refugees destroyed them both. In “I’d Love You To Want Me,” an aging professor in a slow decline from dementia begins to call his wife of many decades by another woman’s name. Committed to his daily care, she bridles at the insult, and frets over who the other woman might have been. Her son Vinh sometimes checks on her; brought to America with his siblings at a very young age, he is utterly Americanized and alienating to her. But, she recalls, even on the tiny boat on which they escaped, she kept their hair neat and their faces clean. She knows how to keep up appearances in the face of the most catastrophic sufferings, or the most quotidian. Nguyen’s stories are carefully structured, but it’s these psychological portraits that make them sing. The pacing of certain stories might be less than propulsive, or the climax a bit limp, but the people within them are crackling with life. The refugees are drawn with the kind of affectionate warmth that’s frank about flaws but accepting of the whole. “The Other Man” is an engrossing character sketch of a young refugee who’s taken in by a gay couple in San Francisco. In close third person, his visceral desires slip through, stifled beneath a mantle of courtesy and a conservative upbringing.  Other stories do combine sharply observed psychology with a forceful arc. In “The Transplant,” a man with a gambling problem, a bad liver and a crumbling marriage, Arthur, gets a new chance to make good after receiving an organ donation from an anonymous donor. After learning the name of the donor, Men Vu, Arthur and his wife hunt down one of his sons, Louis, to thank him. A friendship forms; a grateful Arthur lets Louis warehouse knockoff luxury goods in their garage. When he learns that the man he believed was his savior’s son may be no such thing, he slowly realizes that he’s once again lost control of his own life. Stymied in a bid to turn in or evict the black-market mogul, he surveys his garage:  Louis had conquered every square foot of storage for his fountain pens with their plastic barrels, his sunglasses without ultraviolet protection, his watches that kept perfect time for a day, his designer jackets without linings, his pants with hems that unraveled easily, his discs of pirated movies filmed surreptitiously in theaters, his reproductions of Microsoft software so perfect as to come with the bugs infesting the genuine item, his pseudopills that might or might not help, might or might not harm. With the self-reflection of memoir and the clear-eyed, impartial narration of a history, Nguyen takes readers deep inside his characters in a mere few pages. What he finds there is humanity at neither its worst nor its best, but simply the well-meaning, flawed manifestation we can easily recognize ourselves in.  It’s easy to say that a book called The Refugees matters more than ever right now. It’s also true. For some readers, the collection will tell stories familiar to them, stories they’d recognize from their own families. For others, it will be eye-opening. If Americans have been confronted with a need to break out of their bubbles and experience realities outside themselves, this collection offers that jolt to many readers who have been able to take for granted their American citizenship. These stories make it harder to imagine refugees as threatening, spectral figures advancing like predators on our borders.  The Refugees is also just good. Read it now, or read it later ― but read it.  The bottom line: In nine psychologically evocative short stories, Nguyen lays bare the trauma and emotional ambivalence that lie beneath sentimental or heroic tales of refugees. What other reviewers think: The New Yorker: “Nguyen’s narrative style — restrained, spare, avoiding metaphor or the syntactical virtuosity on display in every paragraph of ‘The Sympathizer’ — is well suited for portraying tentative states. His characters are emotional convalescents, groping their way to an understanding of their woundedness.” The Washington Post: “This is an important and incisive book written by a major writer with firsthand knowledge of the human rights drama exploding on the international stage — and the talent to give us inroads toward understanding it.” Who wrote it? Viet Thanh Nguyen is the author of several books, including the novel The Sympathizer, which won a number of awards including the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. The Refugees is his first story collection. Born in Vietnam, Nguyen grew up in America after his family fled the Viet Cong. He now lives in Los Angeles and is a professor of English and American Studies and Ethnicity at the University of Southern California. Who will read it? Readers drawn to immigrant stories, and those who hope to make sense of current events through fiction. Opening lines: “Fame would strike someone, usually the kind that healthy-minded people would not wish upon themselves, such as being kidnapped and kept prisoner for years, suffering humiliation in a sex scandal, or surviving something typically fatal. These survivors needed someone to help write their memoirs, and their agents might eventually come across me. ‘At least your name’s not on anything,’ my mother once said.” Notable passage: “What she wanted to say, but wouldn’t, was that he should not be frightened. He was not going to die here. But he was frightened, more so than he had ever expected to be. Before Michiko and the children, he believed he would die in an airplane or behind the wheel of a very fast car, anything involving high velocity and a sudden, arresting stop. Now he knew he would probably die with panic pooling in his lungs, in a place where he was not supposed to be, on the wrong side of the world.” The RefugeesBy Viet Thanh NguyenGrove Atlantic, $25.00Published Feb. 7, 2017   The Bottom Line is a weekly review combining plot description and analysis with fun tidbits about the book."
ARTS & CULTURE,Indie Movie Theaters Nationwide To Protest Donald Trump By Screening '1984',"Dozens of independent movie theaters nationwide are preparing to screen a film adaptation of George Orwell’s classic dystopian novel 1984 to protest President Donald Trump’s proposed plan to eliminate humanities agencies such as the National Endowment for the Arts. Screenings of the 1980s film, which features the late John Hurt, will take place in more than 85 theaters across 34 states on April 4. The date marks the first time the story’s protagonist, Winston Smith, writes in his diary ― a major act of resistance against Big Brother, the figurehead of an authoritarian state that uses perpetual war, mass surveillance and censorship to control its people. A portion of the proceeds will benefit local charities and organizations, according to a joint statement released on behalf of participating theater owners. They said they hope the event will “foster communication and resistance against current efforts to undermine the most basic tenets of our society.”  “Orwell’s portrait of a government that manufactures their own facts, demands total obedience, and demonizes foreign enemies, has never been timelier,” the statement reads. “The goal is that cinemas can initiate a much-needed community conversation at a time when the existence of facts, and basic human rights are under attack.” Sales of 1984 spiked last month after critics said that Trump senior adviser Kellyanne Conway had made “Orwellian” remarks, which were eerily reminiscent of language used in the book. Conway claimed that White House press secretary Sean Spicer had provided “alternative facts” when he dubiously told reporters Trump drew the largest inauguration crowds of all time. A complete list of participating theaters can be found here."
ARTS & CULTURE,Simon & Schuster Cancels Milo Yiannopoulos' Book Deal Following Pedophilia Controversy,"A representative from Simon & Schuster announced over Twitter that the publishing house is canceling the publication of Milo Yiannopoulos’ upcoming book Dangerous, following controversy over a surfaced video in which Yiannopoulos appears to defend pedophilia.  Yiannopoulos confirmed the news on Facebook.  The announcement comes just after the Breitbart editor and alt-right poster boy was disinvited from the Conservative Political Action Conference, a conference held next week that is set to feature speakers including Vice President Mike Pence and Trump adviser Steve Bannon.  Statement: After careful consideration @simonschuster and its @threshold_books have cancelled publication of Dangerous by Milo Yiannopoulos Yiannopoulos was disinvited in part due to controversy over a surfaced video in which he condoned sexual relationships between adults and 13-year-old boys. On Facebook, Yiannopoulos said he was “partly to blame” for the comments, and “certainly guilty of imprecise language, which I regret.” Simon & Schuster received a hefty backlash to their decision to publish Dangerous in the first place, given Yiannopoulos’ history of xenophobia, misogyny, and hate speech. Some critics threatened to boycott the publishing house in response, and Roxane Gay withdrew her upcoming book from the publisher in protest.   Why? Because Yiannopoulos has long used his platform to promote hateful views, from calling Black Lives Matter a “terrorist organization” to likening feminism to a  “cancer.” He also outed a transgender woman in 2016 and called for the online harassment of comedian Leslie Jones.  Which is all to say, although the cancellation is surely warranted, why now?  @AdamRothberg @simonschuster @threshold_books so to clarify: racism and transphobia = worthy of a book contract. pedophilia = not? We have reached out to Simon & Schuster for confirmation and will update accordingly. "
ARTS & CULTURE,In Praise Of Women Who’ve Explored — And Conquered — On Foot,"In Jane Austen’s Pride & Prejudice, Lizzy Bennett scandalizes her norm-abiding acquaintances when she walks three miles through rain and mud to tend to her sick sister. Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley find the act absurd, but do their best to contain their contempt for her dirty stockings. Lizzy, on the other hand, regards a rainy day walk lightly. “I do not wish to avoid the walk,” she said, declining a horse-drawn carriage. “The distance is nothing when one has a motive.” Not everyone of her day would agree, as writer Lauren Elkin points out in her new book Flâneuse, part memoir, part social history of women exploring cities on foot. Elkin thinks of herself as a flâneuse, the female version of a flâneur, or a dandy who fills his days with wandering and observation. But, the book’s introduction notes, there’s no entry for flâneuse in most dictionaries. That’s because, until the 19th and 20th centuries, women didn’t typically go on walks in urban areas, and those who did were presumed to be “street walkers.” Elkin celebrates the historical exceptions, such as George Sand, who found freedom from societal expectations by cross-dressing. She also devotes a chapter of her book to protest, an act made more radical by its oppressive history. The marvel of this month’s Women’s March, then, might not be that it went off peacefully ― the privilege and protection that accompanies white feminism is nothing new ― but that it could happen at all. Women are still not completely free to walk through cities uninhibited; catcalling is one of the more innocuous present burdens. But for one day, they stood up together, and marched ahead. Below, Elkin talks about Flâneuse (on sale Feb. 21 from FSG), protesting, and the history of bipedal exploration. You describe the flâneur as “a figure of masculine privilege and leisure.” When did this status become widely available to women? Certainly with the rise of public entertainments like the department store or the cinema in the late 19th and early 20th century we start to see women spending more time in public space. The First World War as we know brought women into the workforce in unheard-of numbers. Achievements like the right to attend university, vote, own property, obtain a divorce ― there are so many factors which contribute to women becoming independent enough to occupy that role of privilege and leisure. But we’re still not there yet; women still don’t have the freedom to walk in the city that men enjoy. When we can walk in the street without being harassed or groped or assaulted, when we can truly become invisible if we wish to be ― like the flâneur who blends into the crowd ― then I suppose we’ll enjoy something of that privilege and leisure.  The flâneur is also celebrated for being objective or removed in his observations. How is this different for women walkers, who have fewer privileges, such as the privilege of being invisible? Women are put in the position of being either too visible ― as in the situations I described above ― or invisible, as in the history of writing about the city. It’s always this reified canon of masculine writer-walkers from [Thomas] De Quincey to [Charles] Baudelaire to [Walter] Benjamin to [Guy] Debord to [Upton] Sinclair. They’re great to read and walk with, but you have to ask: where are the women? There’s such a range of women’s voices we could be hearing about what it means to be a flâneuse, the different literal and figurative intersections you have to navigate.  Women walking has been unfortunately connected to sexuality rather than freedom. In the past, women walkers were assumed to be “street walkers”; today, women are burdened by catcalling. How has this impacted the idea of the flâneuse? Quite simply we’ve been told she doesn’t exist, she’s an impossibility. But it’s not as simple as saying women haven’t had the freedom to walk the way men have. Women have still walked in cities ― they’ve just negotiated a complex web of constraints and challenges to do it. It just means the flâneuse has to take certain risks to claim her space in the city.  In your book you write about George Sand, who was only able to walk freely and independently by cross-dressing. Do you think women walkers have to deal with the same sort of restrictions today?  I think society asks us to. Don’t wear too short a skirt, carry this pepper spray, lace your keys between your fingers. It shouldn’t be up to us to modify the way we present. There will always be someone who finds something else for you to change. No, I think we need to be done with restrictions. I think the onus should no longer be on us. You also write in your book about protesting or marching as an extension of the freedom of walking. Do you think it’s especially powerful for women to use their bodies in this way today? I do! The Women’s March had an incredible impact on morale, and I think the Republicans were really freaked out by it. They thought they had the monopoly on populist movements. But in spite of the noise they’re making about the results of the election being “the will of the people,” 3 million more people voted for Hillary Clinton, and against the guy who’s occupying the White House. I think it’s incredibly important to create a populist movement not only of the Left but of those who believe it’s important to defend our constitution and democratic institutions from the onslaught of this crypto-fascist and his band of freaky friends. But since women’s rights are directly threatened by this president and his party, it’s even more important for women to take part in this movement.  If there’s one message you want readers to take away from your book, what would it be?  That it’s so important for women to dare, to make themselves visible, to get outside, to show up. Political complacency is as deadening as walking down the same street every day, without being alive to the infinite variations life puts in our path.  "
ARTS & CULTURE,10 Ideas That Could Save American Poetry,"Ask ten American poets if poetry is dead, and seven will say it’s not, one will say it is, and two will contort themselves gymnastically trying to prove to you that the fact that poetry is dead is somehow a boon to the art-form. Ask ten non-poets living in America if poetry is dead, and it’s a clean sweep: ten of ten will tell you it’s deader than Stephen Miller’s bedroom eyes. This article is for all twenty people—as well as those who, on principle, don’t answer questionnaires. It’s for poets because contemporary American poetry has, since the early 1970s, routinized being a national disappointment. Barely a fraction of the energies endemic to poetry-as-art are now being harnessed by (we) contemporary poets, and it’d be high time for an end to that even were it not the case that poets are more or less the only people who read poetry regularly. American poetry has become a niche culture—like the ones available for players of Magic the Gathering, or self-described “Bronies,” or advocates of “furry” sex—and not the vibrant performance of endlessly differentiated artistic perspectives it should be. This means that decisions about how to write poetry are being made, both implicitly and explicitly, with an eye toward what a very narrow subculture of artists demands and will reward. The result is a betrayal of the very capacity for historic, system-challenging idiosyncrasy that makes poetry worth composing in the first place. For every game-changing book of poetry by a poet like Claudia Rankine, there are three hundred that join the freeway of American poetry publishing as indistinguishably as a Camry or Civic does I-90 in Sioux Falls. All that said, there’s little point in writing an article about the death of poetry that’s explicitly aimed at working poets because American poetry today is—besides terminally wounded—a death-cult. In installing the rigid subcultural economy so many of them frequent, American poets have entered a suicide pact that ensures their own perpetual unhappiness as well as the demise of poetry as a relevant public gesture. Indeed, in my experience so committed are poets to the rituals of their aging cult that any challenge whatsoever to its key mantras is taken as an act of betrayal—one punishable by violent expulsion from the group. In my case, that’s okay, even fortuitous; I was a member in reasonably good standing within the cult for a number of years, and I’ve largely left it now. But I’ve also found that one of the only honorable gestures one can make when one has escaped a cult that eats lives and devours the very principles it claims to elevate is to expose it for what it is as often and as publicly as one can. And since every missive filled with cult-rage sent in response to that sort of extroverted self-exorcising has already been written in my head innumerable times, there’s no reason now (detractors, please take note) to hand me the hard copy of same or “cc” me on a digital reduction. This article is therefore more vigorously intended for the non-poet because you, more than anyone, have been lied to about what poetry is—which you couldn’t have known because the people most loudly denouncing any definition for “poetry” alternative to the false one were either (a) self-avowed “poets” themselves, and thereby capable of “pulling rank” on you, or (b) educators so thoroughly tortured over the years of their own education into a false consciousness about poetry that the very least they could do was honor that generation-spanning cycle of violence by perpetuating it.  So let’s be clear: the poetry most non-poets are likely to have been exposed to in high school or college or anywhere else is to the maximum capacity of the poetic act in 2017 what the Wiggles are to the entertainment of small children.  The poetry you’ve read, that is, is either (a) poetry that was dangerously revolutionary at the time well in the past it was written, but is now presented to you as an aesthetic rather than political achievement in order to ensure it remains as alien to your contemporary aesthetic sensibilities as possible, or (b) whatever contemporary poetry was able to get through a complex subcultural system exquisitely designed to keep you permanently uninterested in poetry. So the fact is that most non-poets hate poetry about the same way I hate bluegrass: I haven’t really heard any of it, and I didn’t like what little I heard, and I didn’t give much thought at all to what I did hear, so I’ve decided not to hear any more—which seems reasonable given that there are so many things to do in life. That attitude toward poetry worked just fine during the Johnson administration—about the last time poetry could claim broader cultural relevance, due to the sometimes explosive work of the Beats, the Black Arts Movement, the San Francisco Renaissance, and the poets of the New York School—but as a nation we badly missed the vibrant poetry scene we desperately needed during the horrors of Vietnam’s final years, the Nixon resignation, the rise of the “Me Generation” under Reagan, and the thoroughly immersive horror-show of a fake hunt for WMDs in the aughts and a tinpot dictator arising from American soil in the present. Look in desperation for a Pussy Riot in poetry, or a Marina Abramović, or a Robert Mapplethorpe, or a Lenny Bruce, or even as congenial a rebel as a David Foster Wallace, and you’ll come up empty. That’s in part because you’re asking the wrong questions and looking in the wrong places for such poets and poetry—and in part because 100,000 working American poets (the largest committed poetry-writing population of any nation on earth) are doing their level best to keep you looking their way rather than any other.  (They’re failing, of course, inasmuch as, if you’re like most Americans, you’re not reading any poetry at all.) So below are ten ideas that could save American poetry. The list is obviously non-exhaustive, and these ideas do not comprise a prescription for poetry-writing. It’s consistent with American poetry’s radical birth in the First Amendment that every poet should write however they damn well please, and that different people come to poetry for very different things. What these ideas are, however, is a confession, by a longtime poet, that while not many poets need to be integrating these ideas into their poetry-writing practice, and not many non-poets need to re-dedicate themselves to reading poetry and poets undergirded by the principles below, at least some do if poetry is going to survive much further into the digital age. In short, America, poetry needs you in a much more obvious way than you need poetry. Fortunately, the poetry that needs you the most, and which, in turn, non-poets most need whether they realize it or not, is not the poetry that many poets are now writing or the poetry that non-poets are currently not reading. Instead, it’s an entirely different and in certain respects particularly American beast that deserves your attention as much now as the Ramones did in the 1970s. And it’s just about as good for you. NOTE: Every video in this article is poetry. Note also that while some of these ideas are ones I’ve developed, others have been in development for a very long while by a great many people who are not me. The point is not that a person—me or anyone else—can individually do anything to rescue poetry from a poetry subculture that daily celebrates falseness, cruelness, smallness, and exclusion, but that the same subculture that is now systematically strangling poetic innovation on occasion produces the tools of its own dismantling. If there is a good thing to be said about contemporary American poetry, it is that it is not yet so disconnected from its own distress that it cannot provide clues to those on the lookout for a course correction. So here’s a start in that direction, at least: 1. Poetry is not a genre of art. What poetry is is a “meta-genre,” meaning that it’s a concept you find—and already enjoy—in innumerable genres of art you love and regularly consume. The most succinct definition of poetry I’ve come across holds that a poem is a “reflexive language system,” which means, taking those three words in reverse order, that it’s (a) a phenomenon that exhibits signs of a formal structure, (b) expressed in any mode of communication that qualifies as a “language” (including oral, written, visual, nonverbal, experiential, multimedia, transmedia, augmented-virtuality, augmented-reality, and virtual-reality modes of communication), which also (c) shows signs of self-awareness that it is (i) communicative and (ii) has form.  Still shorter: any form of communication self-consciously informed by a philosophy of communication (what we call a “poetics”) can be poetry.  Shortest: poetry is an idiosyncratic literacy operating on a common language. What this means is that any comedian worth remembering after they’re dead—Lenny Bruce, George Carlin, Richard Pryor, or Robin Williams, for instance—was probably using the meta-genre we know as “poetry” to create an unforgettable series of performances whose attitude toward language was complex, internally coherent, and worthy of long-term recall and study. The same is true of every musician who pioneers a genre, whether it’s Gil Scott-Heron and rap, The Monks and punk, Roky Erickson and psychedelia, or diverse trailblazing figures from John Cage to Joanna Newsom, Charlie Parker to Sturgill Simpson.  Simple fact: if you’re artist and you don’t have a “poetics”—an idiosyncratic philosophy, arising from the sum of your interests and knowledge and experience, about the purpose of communication—your work won’t just be forgotten when you die but will be forgotten while you’re still alive. 2. Don’t feel obligated to connect with any poetry that’s not as meaningful to you as your favorite music, comedy, cinema, or visual art is. Somewhere along the way poetry got separated out from all the other art-forms in a very particular way: it became all right to say “I like poetry” or “I don’t like poetry”—everyone would know what you meant—when you’d sound ridiculous if you were to say, “I don’t like any music” or “I don’t like any movies” or “I never laugh at comedians.”  The truth is, when it comes to art we all like about 5% of what’s out there. If you could sit down and hear every band that ever cut a track, or watch every film ever made, or listen to every stand-up comedian who ever booked a gig in a two-bit basement bar, you’d have no interest in 95% of it and find the rest thoroughly engaging.  Poetry is the same way, inasmuch as I can tell you now that, whoever you are, at least 95% of poetry isn’t for you and shouldn’t be. And your dislike of it no more means you “don’t like poetry” than disliking Garth Brooks means you don’t like any music. But all that said, I bet I could find some poetry you dig. The key difference between music and cinema and stand-up comedy—art-forms which increasingly are not “managed,” meaning you can access the full range of performances they have to offer with little or no difficulty—is that poetry is beholden to a system that distributes a narrow band of the art-form to American audiences. Our high schools, our colleges, and even many of our local reading series are a devious form of “managed care” inasmuch as they take care of poetry’s legacy by imposing atop it a massive, labyrinthine subcultural bureaucracy under whose ministrations the patient has died unnecessarily.  The upshot: hold poetry to the same standard you do any other art-form, but also militate, alongside me and many others, for poetry to unlock its doors so that you can experience its range (and so its poets can be encouraged to produce and expand that range) in the same way every other American art-form now permits. 3. Poets are charged more than any other type of artist with torching language and all its conventions. There’s a reason that, throughout history, poets have been among the first targeted for death in every autocratic power-grab, though you’ll find almost no evidence of that history in the interviews American poets give about poetry. If you’ve ever read or listened to an interview with an American poet—and you probably haven’t; even most poets haven’t when they say they have—you’ll hear a lot of saccharine talk about how poetry either (a) preserves language and memory and the sensory elements of communication beneath a beautiful bell jar (perhaps like the one in Disney’s Beauty and the Beast), or (b) uses language in some other esoteric way certain to have a dramatic impact on the life and sensibilities of no one but the poet.  Along with either one of these two lines of reasoning you’ll hear a lot of wild claims about the power of poetry that no poem you’ve ever read has substantiated. You will suspect, rightly, that what many poets see in poetry is simply a mirror-image of what they need from poetry—psychologically, emotionally, and/or socially—not what poetry is likely to be to anyone else who does not harbor those specific needs. But there are poets out there who take a different view, who say that having a “poetics” means trying to create either an entirely new System of the World or firebomb (metaphorically) the existing one with the same manic energy you’d find at a death-metal concert.  The first exertions of an autocratic or revolutionary cultural pulse are always felt in language, and as any poet’s core milieu is language—sometimes accompanied by music, sometimes by the moving images of a film, sometimes performed on a stage with comic timing—a poet’s most profound palette is always power itself. The poet contests the world with language; while it’s equally true that the poet constructs new worlds with language, for too long in American poetry the contestations found in poems have been excessively coded ones and the constructions it enables about as private as Trump’s Mar-a-Lago.  My point is that as and when you find yourself looking for examples of humans using language to decimate the chains that bind them, you are in search of poetry. And when you find the reflexive language system you’re looking for—the human communication that knows exactly how and why and where it must exist—you may find it in music, in a political speech, in the cinema, or anywhere else fellow homo sapiens are battling death and eternity. 4. Poetry is more forgiving of “error” and more celebratory toward what makes you a weirdo than anything else because it’s worthless. Music, stand-up comedy, cinema, political speech-making—all have boundaries and standards of “taste” applied to them because all are commercially viable. For the “badness” of a film, say, to be celebrated, the badness must not just be extraordinary but something to be held up to the smugness of our collective scorn—as is the case with Tommy Wiseau’s The Room.  Music does a bit better—the reflexive disposability of glam-rock (a poetics) and the celebration of amateur musicianship we sometimes find in punk (also a poetics) acknowledge “badness” as a necessary component of communication—but then we find, in political speech-making, that there is a right way and a wrong way to do it, and the wrong way is near-universally derided. (This is one reason why, for all that nearly every aspect of his character and his political agenda is odious, Donald Trump should be celebrated by those with the hearts of poets for just one thing: his ability to subvert the mechanics of political speech-making. Trump, out of folly rather than genius, has reshaped, for instance, at what grade-level a political speech can be written, how often a word—particularly an empty platitude or verbal tic—can be repeated, and what sort of body language or voice inflection is eligible for the adjective “presidential.” We might not like the result, but we can still agree that there should be more ways to rouse a crowd in American politics than just the one. Incidentally, Bernie Sanders also found a new language in which to encode a politics, which is why he too struck an unlikely chord this last election season).  Note that in calling a poem a “reflexive language system” we do not say it has to be marketable, that it has to please many people, or even that it need be pleasing in its form, mode of communication, or concept—merely that it have a form, a communicative capability, and a concept. A poem that makes you enraged, that makes you laugh, that befuddles you, that leaves you markedly cold, or that makes you join a political revolution like the one now forming in opposition to Donald Trump is no less a poem because it doesn’t offer slick production values or doesn’t appeal to your personal tastes. Poems can revel in sloppiness, in “badness,” in their schlocky fidelity to how we actually live, think, speak, feel, fear, love, and see. The idea that poetry must be an elevation of language above the mire of existence is a falsehood perpetuated by literary propagandists. But part of this idea—the idea that poetry’s dodgy economics are a benefit to it, not a hindrance—is the idea that poets have to start fighting more vigorously for this ethos to invade poetry produced in the academy as well.  Since 1993, creative writing has grown faster in terms of terminal-degree program creation than any other discipline, but we don’t see the markers of that success in such programs’ funding packages. Too many young poets are kept from accessing the time and space to write that a writing program offers by an inability to afford the bill. And it is an actual evil—I use that word, evil, advisedly—that many of the powers that be in American poetry have worked so hard to ensure that graduate creative writing programs will never become the fully funded terminal-degree programs they should be. So treating the economics of poetry as a surprising asset for the art-form also means eliminating any barriers to that maxim being universal rather than just local.  In America today we have an opportunity for our creative writing MFA programs to be fully funded in the same way terminal-degree programs in all other academic disciplines are, and to the extent certain poets stand in the way of that progress they should be swept aside as enemies of not just art but the real lives of real people. (Note that I don’t include in this rhetoric those who work in programs that are not fully funded and are doing their level best to change the economic superstructure of their writing program.) The same can be said of any poet—and there are many today in this group, including many atop poetry’s subcultural hierarchy—who consider themselves entitled to decide who should or should not be writing poetry or what a poet can or cannot write. Poetry, however idiosyncratically defined and located, should be everyone’s pursuit, and to narrow the path toward it, whatever one’s self-righteous reasons for doing so, is as much an actual evil as is putting it out of reach of the poor. Poetry must be ever mindful, in particular, of opening its doors still wider to the shy, the Middle American, and the suffering—whether those suffering persons are straight and white and male or members of a minority population. 5. A poet knows better than anyone that words are just words. A poet can celebrate how much a single word is worth—can show us how just three words (say liberty, equality, and fraternity, or we the people) can move an entire nation to action—but knows too what comedians have long known, which is that language is endlessly malleable, fungible, ephemeral, and combinatory.  A poet can treat words like a jazz musician treats notes—as an opportunity for improvisation (a comment on form which is, of course, its own formal structure)—or like Girl Talk treats samples. That’s right: literary remixing is a thing, and is poetry. You can remix other people’s poems, or your own Facebook feed, or someone else’s Facebook feed, or the words on the back of a cereal box. You can also appropriate—or misappropriate—language as part of a poetics, such as turning a Donald Trump speech into poetry or falsely attributing a series of lyric monologues to a dead person. You can explode linguistic taboos and expose their innards. You can loop an unscripted Chat Roulette session into the middle of a poem that performs the experience of reading the internet, as I once saw the poet Jesse Damiani do at a reading in Oxford, Mississippi, or turn the Nirvana album Nevermind into an epic book of poetry with one line of Cobain’s lyrics per page, as has also been done recently.  You can do whatever the hell you want in/as poetry, provided it is done reflexively—that is, mindfully, and with consideration of form and concept—and provided it generates something more than a private (i.e., non-communicative) language system. Words are material, and so they act, and can be acted upon, just like any other material: they can break, explode, recombine, be poorly made, be dropped into the same space over and over, and so on. They can also generatively displease us, moving us to action or new philosophies by dint of their provocations. 6. Poetry is not just the best but perhaps the only way to authentically “perform” your life. I said poetry is a meta-genre, and it is, but of course this also means that, when we find it, we can identify its operations independent of any accompaniment. Miles Davis could make poetry with a trumpet, and Jimi Hendrix with a guitar, and Robert Mapplethorpe with a camera, but while we always carry our ability to make words with us, we do not always have a trumpet, guitar, or camera at hand.   Poetry, in other words, doesn’t come from the trumpet, or the guitar, or the camera, but from a series of competencies and knowledge bases that (say) Davis, Hendrix, and Mapplethorpe had been deriving all their lives from their experiences and their psyches. Poets ought to stop advertising poetry as an instrument for constructing something entirely different from the world we all live in, when what most of us need or would ever want to come to art for is to perform our lives as we live them. That is, in our words, our ideas, the sounds of our life, and the spaces in which we move.  Davis’ plan for performing “So What” (see above), or Moondog’s relationship with the constituent sounds that make up his slice-of-life self-titled album (see below), would be where the poetry is even if neither Davis nor Moondog had ever cut an album. In my own life, I find that much of what I say and do is built upon the invisible foundation of what the people I care about and admire have said and done to me in the past, so I sometimes write poems in which I combine my language with the language of those other people without distinguishing between what I “wrote” and what others have said. Why? Because what I am—all I am—is a superficially seamless combination of those two categories of language, and so I use poetry to perform that fact.  In music, it takes John Cage’s extraordinary composition 4’33”—which is just four minutes and thirty-three seconds of silence, forcing the listener to hear the sounds of her own life (e.g., breathing, others’ coughing)—to make a similar point. Meanwhile, in poetry I (or anyone) can replicate that idea in innumerable ways whenever I feel like it. No trumpet, guitar, camera, or other instrument besides my own knowledge of my life is necessary, as I always carry my words and the sounds of my life and the relationship I develop between and among these things wherever I go. There’s a reason poetry is one of the oldest art-forms: it’s something you can create alone and without possessions on a deserted island, or when your village and all its resources have been destroyed, or when you’re so stricken by fear or sadness or anger that you can’t lift your head up or reach for anything solid. And as noted already, it animates even those arts in which the words “sonnet” and “stanza” have no meaning. 7. No other type of artist needs years of groupthink-oriented, aesthetically essentialist “workshopping” to become what they need to be, and neither do poets—so the contemporary poetry “workshop” can safely be detonated. In the conventional poetry workshop, (a) printed poetry written in the then-period style is consumed by students, (b) little emphasis is put on how poems are performed and how the certainty of future performance can inform the writing of a work, (c) students are given identical reading assignments rather than helped to find the poetry they personally would benefit most from encountering, (d) poetry is treated as an aesthetic artifact rather than a meta-genre, meaning that students discuss it as though it were a means of self-expression with ingrained rules and methods and modes for self-determining its own value, and (e) classes are run with an eye toward the deductive reasoning needed to “fix” a single student’s work, rather than as celebrations of the inductive philosophical discussions of “poetics” that using student work as a jumping-off point can deliver.  Why are workshops run this way? Because it’s easiest for the instructor, who is probably a working poet themselves with other things on their mind—like their own writing—rather than helping to guide ten to twelve emotionally volatile younger poets on their ten to twelve incredibly complex, idiosyncratic journeys of artistic discovery. The conventional workshop is also less scary for such a teacher-poet, who’s likely (like most poets) an introvert, as it operates under a series of common assumptions about the purpose of the class, the structure of the pedagogy, and the general outline of a “good” poem that are knowable in advance. It takes faith in how poetry provokes novel considerations of language to permit students to pursue wide-ranging, wholly exploratory conversations—conversations in which student work is a dialogic catalyst rather than a fetish.  The good news: the contemporary workshop is actually an idea stolen from the late 1880s, when it was used at Harvard to teach advanced composition courses. That means the poetry “workshop” as we know it today was never intended for use in the discipline of creative writing, and is in no way suitable to or tailored to that endeavor. We can dump it or simply reinvent it right now without doing any harm to anyone. A redesigned workshop would center idiosyncrasy, poetics, error, exploration, performance, collaboration, multimedia, getting outside the classroom, and much else that has only a very limited place in contemporary creative writing pedagogy. 8. Poetry is something you chase, not something you do. To be a poet is to chase whatever “poetry” is through the channels of time, and since those channels of time are multifaceted and variously bent or straightened by things like technology and politics we can be certain that poetry is changing as time slides on. The gatekeepers of what poetry is or can be, or what a poet is or can be, are not very happy about the internet because acknowledging the internet means that poetry can’t ever again be what it once was. No more than sculpture can be for us now what it was for Michelangelo, given that unlike Michelangelo we have 3D printing, augmented- and virtual-reality modeling, and sufficient cultural bandwith to create “experiential art” in which the sculpture conforms to the contours of the user’s life rather than vice versa (see Meow Wolf for an example).  When radio changed poetry, that was registered in Ezra Pound’s Cantos, which was celebrated in its time if not as much as it would be after Pound’s death; in many respects, television entered printed-page poetry with the documentary, peripatetic poetics of The New York School; today, poets are struggling to accommodate the internet because it feels technocratic rather than bohemian, is too large and invasive a sea change in human culture to readily grasp, and is much harder to market in the book-publishing milieu that American poetry’s rigid subculture still idolizes. When I say that one “chases” poetry, I mean that the role of the poet is as much to determine where poetry is headed and to inhabit and explore that space as it is to perform (or, more commonly, to perform over and over again) what poetry was in some past moment. Poetry became a knowledge base—a skill-set teachable in the academy—in part to justify its positioning in the academy, not because poetry-as-art is static and knowable. In fact, poetry exists now, and is being permanently inflected now, in the technologies of tomorrow (e.g., advanced biomodification, nanotechnology, cryptocurrencies, haptic VR tech) even as poets are regularly publishing work that wouldn’t have been out of place in the 1950s. But that’s where poetry was; we should neither celebrate nor hold up as the Platonic “poet” one who is simply able to reproduce a form first perfected over a half-century ago. Being a poet is, in this respect, as much about a spirit of adventure, critical and creative thinking skills, and a high degree of self-knowledge (up to a “poetics”) as it is about distinguishing between a couplet and a quatrain. 9. The fact that nobody will buy, read, teach, or enjoy your poetry means that it’s the one thing that is totally yours. A little-known secret—even poets hush it up—is that the average book of poetry sells about 50 copies, mostly to the family and intimate friends of the poet, and even a top-selling poetry book (say, the top 1% of books of poetry published each year) sells about 1,500 to 2,000 copies, which means that it’s owned by 1.5% to 2% of the more than 100,000 working poets in the United States. Now how many of those who own these top-selling poetry books actually read them cover to cover? Unknown. Probably less than half. How many of that half deeply enjoy what they read? Probably a quarter. And how many of that quarter are (a) teachers of poetry and (b) would teach a given book of poetry to others even where the poet is not a personal friend of theirs? Maybe one-tenth. And how many who ever read that book will not only read it cover-to-cover and enjoy it immensely, but also remember it for even a year? Maybe one in a hundred, and even then it’s most likely to be the author’s best friend or his mother. But it’s still more likely, if you’re a poet, that your best friend secretly dislikes your poetry and your mother wishes you’d done something more “productive.” What I’m saying is that American poets have found innumerable ways to hide from themselves that no one’s listening: for instance, by habitually attending an annual literary conference that seems packed and therefore makes poetry seem vibrant; by never revealing to anyone their own books’ sales figures, and by frequenting publishing houses that pull the same sleight-of-hand; by pretending that having read one poem by a poet is the same as having “read the poet,” and thereby pretending to a broader knowledge of the poetry scene than any poet actually has; by fooling ourselves into the belief that when our friends or family “like” our poetry it means anything more than that our friends and family like us. But what if we took the opposite view? What if poetry became widely understood to be the only artifact you can possibly make that is potentially history-altering for others both holds every bit of its value so long as it channels everything you are? What if poetry, whether on its own or accompanied by guitars or translated through a camera, is the only thing humans really know how to make before they die that freezes in time what it was like for them to be alive? What if the old adage that says the only way to make a blank piece of paper less valuable is to write a poem on it also means that what a poem can be is not restricted by economics, culture, or the psychosocial? 10. If poets for once steal a page from a group of seeming adversaries—professional writers—they’ll start to save poetry by habit rather than design. When I teach professional writing, I often contrast it to self-conscious (often a euphemism for “self-expressive”) writing in this way: I note that a “professional writer” thinks first and perhaps almost exclusively about the experience his or her audience is having. The problem, of course, is that this sort of ethos, necessary as it is for professional and technical writing, has always been thought of as the death-knell for imaginative writing. After all, if one’s audience is in the driver seat, able to demand from the writer that specific forms and conventions be met before a document is published, whither the “poetics” of the author?  In fact, the delirious glory of having a poetics is that not only is it definitionally a relationship with language and culture and identity—and a theory of same—that’s entirely unique to a given author, it’s also a near certainty that the more authentically idiosyncratic a poetics is, the better performed it will be by the author and the more mesmerizing it will be for its audience.  No poem is worse than the one that was written to someone else’s design—that’s true—but it’s equally true that no poem is less likely to be effective for a prospective audience (which has undoubtedly, in that scenario, heard a thousand such poems before). My point is that many poets loathe the idea of developing an idiosyncratic poetics because they fear it will alienate their audience; they’re fooling themselves, however, as in fact developing an idiosyncratic poetics is the only thing they can do that will allow them to discover an audience for the long-term.  A poetry informed by a poetics finds its proper audience over time. This is especially true if we imagine poets wanting to reach a non-poetry-writing audience. Much like musicians don’t want to sing only for other musicians, or painters paint for other painters, poets who wish to be read by non-poets need to be less, rather than more, constricted by what other poets consider appropriate and artful. Poets should begin demanding of themselves work that could not possibly have been created by anyone else—work that is thoroughly (in form, content, concept, performance, and sensory contours) of and by them rather than anyone else. Poets and non-poets should demand this, too, of all the poetry they read, which may require shutting up a bit about the work of one’s friends and asking them to do the same for you (if you’re a poet). Only a poetry economy in which we celebrate that which delights us—not considering its author—is one in which we perpetually send the message that thinking about audience is okay, being idiosyncratic is okay, torching language and communicative conventions in the way singer-songwriters and comedians and screenwriters do is okay. What needs to be maintained in poetry, and what is threatened by poetry’s present provincial subculture—including the conventional writing workshop, the mob mentality of poet communities on social media, the cliquishness of cosmopolitan poetry enclaves, and the narrowness and inherent dishonesty of poetry’s publishing sphere—is the key element of surprise. While we should always seek delight in poetry, so too should we feel a poem to be a bracing wind that unsettles even as it inspires. Many of these ideas may seem internally contradictory, such as saying that poetry can move nations even as it perfectly performs the idiosyncrasies of the self, but in fact this is merely the “meta-meta-genre” quality of poetry that makes poetry even more awe-inspiring a human construct than I’ve averred here.  In other words, our definition(s) of poetry have, themselves, a poetics. Poetry is, after all, a system of seemingly contradictory ideas which, taken together, make the composition of poetry possible. Poetry would not be as rich as it is, or as resilient as it is, if its central character was purely political or, alternatively, purely personal. If it could not be disseminated via a market it would lose its cultural capital—or, its potential cultural capital—and that remains true even as we note that poetry fruitfully resides beyond economics. Creative writing pedagogy is crucial because it brings people together to wrestle with the question of what poetry can be, even as our current national pedagogy is harmful and ought to be discarded post-haste. Poetry is changed fundamentally by the fact that, like us, it moves through and is changed by the fourth dimension of time, but this doesn’t touch the fact that many a young poet was moved to chase poetry’s ever-retreating form by reading Walt Whitman as a child. Poetry is animated by Life, but often must traffic in destruction and reconstruction to do the difficult work of constantly refreshing what it means to be alive. And finally, as much as it may seem an act of prestidigitation, redefining what poetry is to view it as a meta-genre—present in the best music, cinema, comedy, and visual art—can be an essential act of resistance and redefinition even for those poets committed to poetry as an artifact for the printed page. So, is poetry dead? Yes. Did poets kill it? Yes. Is the thing that died the thing poetry is now? No. Which frees us to go in search of it. And what we find when we do, particularly in congregations of aspiring poets both in and out of the academy, is that the ideas above draw into the ambit of poetry many who currently do not—but should—consider themselves “poets,” such as pioneers in music, VR technology, and performance art. We find also, as educators and as those hoping to encourage aspiring poets in whatever setting, that young men and women who come to poetry to produce the conventional forms of expression we associate with it—that is, printed, lyrically self-aware writings—benefit enormously from seeing their palette of options expanded, as to both a poetics and the execution of a poetics, to include the principles enumerated above. Any fear that poetry as poets understand it now will be lost in the contemplation of poetry as it really is and can be sorely underestimate the resilience and flexibility of even “conventional” poetic expressions (and convention-oriented authors as well).  As is the case with so many other human endeavors, poetry ceases to be brittle when the discussion of it ceases to be brittle. The same goes for politics, culture, and self-identity in an age of such entrenched inter-human divisions. Poetry is a path we can choose to take, and that many more of us than currently do should opt to explore, as the best means yet devised to move up and out and away from darkness.

ARTS & CULTURE,Activist Artist Dread Scott On Why We Need A Revolution,"Activist artist Dread Scott creates in a language of searing simplicity. His work subverts American iconography to reveal the brutal injustices embedded in our nation’s marrow.  Scott’s first major piece, “What is the Proper Way to Display a US Flag?” was on view at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 1989, when Scott was just 24 years old. The participatory installation featured a photomontage of American flags in various circumstances ― draped atop the coffins of soldiers and lit aflame by South Korean students. A genuine American flag lay across the floor. Viewers, then, were invited to write down their thoughts on the proper way to display the flag, and potentially step on the flag during the process. President George H. W. Bush called the work “disgraceful,” which signaled to Scott that he was doing something right.  More recently, Scott erected a black flag reading “A Man Was Lynched By Police Yesterday” outside of Jack Shainman Gallery in Manhattan. The artwork was an updated version of the banner that hung outside the headquarters of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1936, re-installed after Alton Sterling and Philando Castile were shot and killed by police in the summer of 2016.  The flag is now on view at San Francisco’s Guerrero Gallery as part of the exhibition “Past, Present, Future,” a show squarely aimed to address the current political moment, a reversal of progress for those who have spent their lives marginalized, silenced and oppressed. Along with the flag, Scott will also show a piece entitled “IMAGINE A WORLD / WITHOUT AMERICA,” named after a quote by Bob Avakian, leader of the Revolutionary Communist Party, USA.  “I first read it in 1989 and it stuck with me,” Scott told The Huffington Post. “I began to think of it it as a provocative thought experiment.” The piece features a map of the world, the perspective shifted so that the United States is dangling off the image’s edge, barely visible and ostensibly irrelevant. The piece dares Americans to put their own nationalism in check and imagine a radically different world where they are not the focus.  For decades, Scott has made blistering artwork that refuses to let America avert its gaze. In this current political climate, when years of progress are in danger of being reversed, his unapologetic work needs to be seen. We reached out to Scott to discuss.  How would you describe the way art and activism coexist in your work?  I generally keep my art and activism somewhat separate. Typically my art isn’t bringing people to a demonstration or seeking particular demands, which my activism typically is — including when I encourage people to be part of a movement for revolution, a revolution to get rid of this entire system and replace it with one that would meet the needs of humanity as a whole. That said, for much of the last three decades, my work has been addressing some of the big questions confronting people. As art, which I show in major museums, in galleries and on street corners, the work is engaging the viewer and encouraging him or her to think about these questions. I began doing this when I was an undergrad. In the 1980s that wasn’t what you were taught to do with art, and my initial works tried to keep my political ideas and my art separate. But the more I looked at the world and discovered artists ― Leon Golub, Hans Haacke, Roy DeCarava, Alexander Rodchenko and others who were bringing their politics into their art ― I searched for ways to do that with my concerns and aesthetic.  It’s crazy to think you made the work “What’s the proper way to display a U.S. flag?” when you were only 24 years old. What was your reaction when the president commented on your work?  When President Bush Sr. called my work “disgraceful,” my response was: “The President knows about my work and doesn’t like it. Good.” It meant that the work was engaging in a discussion on a national level about an important question. And if the head of this empire didn’t like what I was doing, it was an indication that the work was powerful and that it clearly stood with the people I cared about and the people that Bush wanted to continue to oppress and exploit. The way you folded viewers’ reactions to that piece into the work, it reminds me almost of a proto-social media experiment. Do you think there is any danger in giving a stage to those who respond to your work with such hate and negativity?  Giving voice to white supremacist and vitriolic defenders of America can be a problem. But in the context of the “What is the Proper Way to Display a US Flag?” I think that they became part of the dialogue I initiated and they look like the racists and warmongers that they are. The context is important.  You’ve spoken about the importance of widespread exposure, in terms of ensuring an artist’s work extends beyond a small, uniform subset of people. Has the internet changed how your work is processed and responded to? The internet has enabled some of my projects to reach a wider audience and be seen by people who wouldn’t otherwise see it and also to be studied by students who would not have this level of access if they had to look for a monograph on me or hope that their professor had actual slides. I’m happy that works like “A Man Was Lynched by Police Yesterday” spread in many ways in social media and people far outside of the art world were able to see it and share it. My video, “Anti-Campaign Ad,” was seen by over 10,000 people in a month and that would not have been possible without the internet ― unless it was shown at a major museum, which would never happen within days of it’s creation. You’ve mentioned, in previous interviews, critiques of your work that frame you as a “shock artist.” Can you talk about the difference, if there is one, between shocking work and challenging work, and where you see yourself fitting in? I don’t make work to shock. This is a profoundly polarized world and if you make work that looks at important questions people are bound to be passionate about it. When the police kill 1,100 people each year, making work that calls out these murders will bring joy to people under the gun of the police and people who don’t want a society where the state gets away with murder after murder after murder. Murder by police should be very controversial, but unfortunately these murders are the status quo, and it is making art about it which some view as shocking.   Your “A Man Was Lynched by Police Yesterday” piece was adapted from a flag made in the 1920s. Do you believe our society has made true progress in terms of racial justice [since then]?  The means in which people are oppressed and exploited has changed over the past 240 years, but there is a real continuum between a society that was founded on slavery and genocide and a society that imprisons 2.3 million people, 1 million of whom are Black. Ending slavery took a war. The ideas that rationalized slavery continued under Jim Crow and an economy that fed off the labor of the enslaved continued to brutalize the descendants of the enslaved. After the tremendous fight and sacrifice of the Cilvil Rights and Black Power movement, Jim Crow was replaced by what Michelle Alexander has dubbed the New Jim Crow. So there are changes, but ask the parents of Tamir Rice or Mike Brown whether much has changed since the ‘20s. Ask Muslims who have had hijabs ripped from their heads or Latino students barred from their own school by white students yelling “White Power” and “Trump Trump Trump” if racism has ended or changed much. Many have spoken about Trump’s election as a backlash to the strides made in terms of social justice over the past few years. Can you talk about how you see the relationship between the past, present and future ― and whether the brutal cruelties of the past can ever be left behind? I don’t think that Trump’s election is a backlash based solely on ideas or revenge, but rather what the ruling class in this country sees as a way forward in a world where they face many challenges, including many problems they have created. They are trying to continue to dominate the world and are facing challenges from old rivals and new ones. And those white people that are being used by Trump to consolidate his power, many of them want the unfair advantage that white supremacy afforded them for generations, that has been slightly undermined since the ‘60s. In short, if there are jobs or cheap bank/government loans, they want to go back to a time when those advantages definitely go to white people first without question. And repression should go to black people and Latinos first. And along with all of this this, many want to put women back in the 1950s or 1850s as well. But it’s not a backlash, but rather what’s going on in the economy, where based on the international competition, the U.S. and most other industrialized powers no longer can create the middle class existence for broad sections of society that was important to Western societies for the past 40 years. And in America, this system is going back to some of its key pillars ― white supremacy, patriarchy and Christian fundamentalism ― to negotiate the waters of continuing domination of the world. But I have no interest in the expansion of the U.S. empire or its continued domination of the planet. The cruelties of the past, and present, can only be gotten rid of through revolution. You need to get rid of a system and economy that are based on exploitation if you want to get rid of exploitation. If you want to end racism, you need to get rid of the system that was founded upon it and that has it woven into its very fabric, including its founding documents. Democracy and freedom in the U.S. was conceived of based upon owning human beings. The legal and political framework embodied in the constitution includes slavery. Slavery was not an aberration, mistake or “original sin”, but something that was integral to U.S. democracy. You can’t get to a society without exploitation if your vision of that is bound to a document where the freedom of some necessitated the enslavement of others. So I think that it’s possible to leave the cruelties of the past behind, but only if you make revolution to get rid of a system that needs these cruelties.  How have recent technologies ― including the internet, social media, cameras, video, etc ― contributed to this relationship between past, present and future? Do you see them playing a positive or negative role in the fight for racial justice? Technologies are not positive or negative. The same internet that helped the Arab Spring is used to spy on people all over the planet. It all depends whose hands it’s in. Will the Googles, Apples and Facebooks of the world build Muslim databases or will they refuse to do so? Will they build strong encryption into all technology and enable social justice activists and others to keep government snoops out of their data and prevent them from learning their connections through metadata? Or will they comply with government orders to build in back doors and turn over data, and not even inform people about secret laws and orders? The Freedom Riders broke the law and challenged social order. Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning may have have broken the law but their kind of courage is what is needed on a widespread level, including by corporations to stand up to tyrannical governments. “Dread Scott : Past, Present & Future” runs until March 5 at Guerrero Gallery in San Francisco. "
ARTS & CULTURE,200 Artists From Around The World Launch Initiative To Fight Fascism Through Art,"For HuffPost’s #LoveTakesAction series, we’re telling stories of how people are standing up to hate and supporting those most threatened. What will you stand up for? Tell us with #LoveTakesAction. Anish Kapoor, Steve McQueen, Laurie Anderson, Ed Ruscha, Matthew Barney, Rosalind Krauss, Hank Willis Thomas, Catherine Opie and Yinka Shonibare are among the artists, writers, musicians and curators from around the world committed to using art as a mode of resistance. Over 200 international creatives have signed on to the global art coalition “Hands Off Our Revolution,” which implores artists of all media to channel the anger, sadness, hope and empathy ignited by present affairs into their work, providing viewers, readers and listeners with models of revolt and visions of a harmonious, peaceful future. The initiative came together in response to recent events ― including Brexit, President Donald Trump’s election and the ongoing refugee crisis. As artist Adam Broomberg explained to The Guardian, such instances of xenophobia and populism are interrelated, and artists must join forces to tackle the larger issue together. “What is important is that it is not just seen as America’s problem, or Europe’s problem,” he said, “so we are planning shows in Mexico and Lagos.”  The coalition pledges to host events and exhibitions around the world bringing contemporary politics into the spotlight, the first of which will be announced in March. This is the latest art world reaction to an uncertain political climate, following a recent artist petition against Trump’s immigration ban. While art certainly possesses the power to amplify marginalized voices and visualize alternate futures, many have argued that protests must extend beyond the insular echo chamber of museums and galleries to truly change minds or make a lasting impact on the lives of others.  “Hands Off” will hopefully find ways to reach past the confines of self-congratulatory, topical exhibitions to benefit those who are in need. So far, the platform seems promising, pledging to donate proceeds from upcoming shows and events to arts and activist causes building coalition. And who better to lead the impending revolution than those guided by creativity, empathy and curiosity?  As put by participating artist Yinka Shonibare: “We must all unite, regardless of race, gender or sexual orientation, to oppose all forms of bigotry. Populism must never be a guide to our conduct, empathy should be our guide. As artists we bear witness and we must never be silent or be silenced.” Read the full manifesto from “Hands Off” below: We are a global coalition affirming the radical nature of art. We believe that art can help counter the rising rhetoric of right-wing populism, fascism and the increasingly stark expressions of xenophobia, racism, sexism, homophobia and unapologetic intolerance. We know that freedom is never granted ― it is won. Justice is never given ― it is exacted. Both must be fought for and protected, yet their promise has seldom been so fragile, so close to slipping from our grasp, as at this moment. As artists, it is our job and our duty to reimagine and reinvent social relations threatened by right-wing populist rule. It is our responsibility to stand together in solidarity. We will not go quietly. It is our role and our opportunity, using our own particular forms, private and public spaces, to engage people in thinking together and debating ideas, with clarity, openness and resilience. “Hands Off” is far from the only creative response to Trump’s rhetoric and policies to emerge this week. The Davis Museum at Wellesley College in Massachusetts, for example, announced that it will be de-installing or shrouding all artwork by immigrants, as well as any art given to the museum by immigrants, to protest Trump’s executive order barring immigrants from seven Muslim-majority nations and blocking Syrian refugees from entering the U.S.  The Museum of the City of New York has also voiced its opinion through art, staging an exhibition called “Muslim in New York” that pays tribute to the legacy of Muslim life throughout the city’s five boroughs.

ARTS & CULTURE,Auditions For Broadway's 'Harry Potter And The Cursed Child' Are Happening,"Broadway babies and Harry Potter super-fans, listen here: “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child” auditions are happening. In New York. Next week.  That’s right, according to a listing on Backstage, tryouts for J.K. Rowling’s play picking up where the final book’s epilogue left off, will be held from Feb. 20 until Feb. 22, 2017. Those who make the cut will probably come as close to receiving a Hogwarts acceptance letter as a muggle could possibly dream of.  The memo itemizes all the roles under consideration, along with short descriptions of the characters. Luckily, most of us already know the parts quite intimately. Harry Potter, for example, is described as “Father of James, Albus and Lily. Married to Ginny. Head of Magical Law Enforcement at the Ministry of Magic.” The actor who takes on the role should be no taller than 5’10” and between the ages of 37 and 40. The casting call notes, as well, that every role, all ethnicities are welcome.  Those familiar with the London run of play might recall that Hermione Granger was played by black actress, Noma Dumezweni. Despite the fact that Rowling described Granger in the books as having brown eyes and bushy brown hair, with no mention of her being white, the casting decision was met by some with outrage, outrage Rowling dutifully called out as straight-up racist.  Thus, it’s exciting to see that Rowling and the “Cursed Child” team have continued the tradition of colorblind casting. Given the author’s glorious skewering of the bigoted Twitter trolls in her mentions, it’s not too surprising that she is using her platform to spread a message of diversity and inclusion.  Head to the listing itself to see if you have what it takes to play Harry, Ginny, Moaning Myrtle or Professor McGonagall. The pay, if you’re curious, is $1,974 a week. If you have talent, or a lightning-shaped scar on your forehead, please apply. "
ARTS & CULTURE,All-Women Motorcycle Crew Turns Feminism Up A Gear,"When photographer Akasha Rabut moved to New Orleans in 2010, she was taken by the city’s traditions ― the parades, especially. While photographing one, she noticed two women on motorcycles and decided to introduce herself. Their names were Tru and Love; immediately, Rabut was enamored.  The pair invited her to a meeting for their all-women motorcycle crew, Caramel Curves, which took place in a member’s nail salon. Rabut took the women’s portraits, and has been doing so ever since. “I love the feminism and femininity that these women bring to the masculine world of motorcycle clubs,” Rabut told The Huffington Post, taking care not to conflate the two terms. Her shots of the crew include images of riders enveloped in billowy, hot-pink smoke. In some portraits, their camaraderie is clear as they laugh together wearing matching checkered jackets. In others, the pride they take in their pastime is on display as they pose on their bikes, showing off their high heels. “These women are comfortable riding their bikes in heels and love to emphasize that they can do anything a man can do, only better and in heels,” Rabut said. “I think they do a really good job at combating the stereotype that biking is a masculine hobby.” The women of the Caramel Curves rock lipstick and dangly earrings, bauble-y bracelets and gelled hair. They’ve got tattoos and ripped up jeans, too, fusing aesthetics to send a message about blurred gender lines. “They have just as much, if not more, passion than most men that ride,” Rabut said. “Riding bikes gives them a sense freedom and an outlet in the world. I hope that viewers, especially female viewers, feel empowered by these images.”"
ARTS & CULTURE,Artist Addresses The Racist History Of Photographing Men Of Color,"In her series “Brown,” Erica Deeman photographs men of the African diaspora against a brown backdrop. The straightforward series addresses the omission of black men from the tradition of formal portraiture, revealing the simple power of a photographic depiction.  The project came about while Deeman was mulling over the idea of expectations and the discriminatory frameworks that underlie our assumptions. “I am biracial,” Deeman told The Huffington Post as an example, “and I’ve found that the expectation is that my father is black and my mother is white, but it’s actually the other way around.” The artist then began thinking about men of color and the ways that they have historically been pictured in front of the camera ― the ugly history of physiognomy, and the mugshot, came to mind. Deeman then wondered, if she created images depicting black men in a more dignified light, would they have the power to shatter expectations with no firm footing in reality? Deeman, who is based in San Francisco, recruited strangers to serve as subjects for a series of portraits, the only requirements being that they were of the African diaspora and identified as male. Every man is depicted shirtless, from the shoulders up, staring slightly off-camera. The repetitive formula alludes to the history of portraiture, specifically the stately renderings of patrons, nobility and the aristocratic elite that take up so much space on museum walls. “Men of color historically were not granted the opportunity to appear sympathetic in portraits,” Deeman said. “That was restricted to the bourgeois.” The portraits also allude to the ways photography has been used to criminalize and oppress people of color. “I think photography is problematic because so many people see it as the truth,” Deeman explained. “It has made people buy into physiognomy and eugenics and all of that. I always joke that the photograph was the biggest lie that was ever made.” Physiognomy is a pseudoscientific field that argues one’s character can be determined from his or her appearance, especially facial features. “It was used to justify racism,” Deeman said, “by elevating European features and criminalizing everyone else.” Mug shots, whose aesthetics turn human beings into indexable felons, offer another example of photography invading our subconscious presumptions.  “The mug shot is this very stark presentation,” Deeman said. “Formulaic in its style. People are placed against a blue backdrop or white backdrop, the flash is always the same, everything is the same within the context of the image. I wanted to make something with a formula, but challenge that aesthetic.” In lieu of a blue or white backdrop, for example, she opted for a coffee-colored hue, a color that nearly matches her own skin tone. “It’s about placing myself within the image,” she said. “The color represents me.” Deeman’s work highlights the immense power of a simple ritual, a subject and photographer conspiring to create a portrait. For much of photography’s history, men of color were denied access to self-portraits that truly represented themselves as complex individuals. Deeman hopes to rupture this tradition. “We are together in this place, making this photograph,” she said. “In these photos, I’m saying: ‘This is how I think you should be seen, and this is how you should be seen.’” The artist hopes her work can open up a broader narrative for men of color. She does not want to influence her audience’s perception of her subjects, but rather leave space for the viewer to construct complex hypotheses regarding these strangers’ personalities. Through the project, Deeman hopes people will examine their own expectations a bit more critically. “With the administration that we have right now, there are extreme limits on everybody who is not seen as ‘traditionally American,’” Deeman said. “I think that this body of work can challenge some of the stereotypes that some people want to revert back to.” “Erica Deeman: Brown” will be on view at Anthony Meier Fine Arts in San Francisco from March 24 until April 28."
ARTS & CULTURE,Lin-Manuel Miranda Is Too Busy Planning His Oscars Date With Mom To Worry About MacPEGOTing,"He was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship in 2015. He won a Pulitzer Prize for “Hamilton: An American Musical” in 2016. He took home an Emmy for his work on the song “Bigger” for the 67th Tony Awards. He won Grammys for both the “In the Heights” and “Hamilton” soundtracks. And he’s been awarded a total of three Tonys for those two shows, as well.   Now all Lin-Manuel Miranda has to do is take home the Oscar for Best Original Song at this year’s ceremony and he will MacPEGOT, an honor yet to be accomplished by any performer in the biz.  When reminded of this remarkable feat during a recent phone conversation with The Huffington Post, Miranda ― who’s nominated for his song “How Far I’ll Go” from Disney’s “Moana” ― laughed and insisted, “That’s not a thing! That’s crazy.” “Obviously, you can’t worry about that,” he continued. “I think the term EGOT was coined by someone who didn’t win any of the things, right? So I think once you start trying to win awards, you immediately stop winning them, that is my feeling about it [laughs]. But I’m really proud of my work. I’m really proud to be in this company. But I have no control over whether we win. I’m just excited to take my mom to the Oscars, since I watched it with her so many times.”  Miranda is up against big Oscar contender “La La Land” and two of the film’s songs, “Audition (The Fools Who Dream)” and “City of Stars,” as well as “Can’t Stop the Feeling!” from “Trolls” and “The Empty Chair” from “Jim: The James Foley Story.”  “It’s the Mad Libs of a category,” Miranda said. “I’m lucky enough to be nominated for Tonys, and those are your peers ― they’re generally people you know and you go, ‘Oh my gosh, yay! Alan Menken is nominated again!’ Or whoever your co-nominee is. But to be in a category with Justin Timberlake and Sting is crazy. And I’ve known Benj Pasek and Justin Paul for many years, and I’m thrilled with their success. This is going to be a huge year for them between ‘La La Land’ and ‘Dear Evan Hansen,’ which is just cleaning up on Broadway.”  You eat lunch and they put you on a giant dais to take a prom pic with all the nominees. Here is Oscar's butt and Pharrell. pic.twitter.com/ai1ANvWgzW We met Viggo Mortensen. He speaks gorgeous fluent Spanish. My mom almost floated away. Miranda has always been a huge fan of the Oscars and has taped the ceremony every year since “The Little Mermaid” ― the movie that made him want to be “in this game” ― won Best Score and Best Song in 1990. Although he says it’s a “real thrill” to be attending the award show, he’s very anxious to be in the room where it happens. “I’ll be so nervous. Anything other than just sitting in the audience nervously will be hard for me,” he told HuffPost of the possibility of being a part of a performance of “How Far I’ll Go.” (It was confirmed on Thursday that Miranda will be singing a duet of the song with “Moana” star Auli’i Cravalho.) “I’m there for the party. I’m there to really just soak it all up. You grow up watching the Oscars so to actually be there, I’m really excited.”  During the process of writing, staging and starring in his musical (have you heard of it?) “Hamilton,” Miranda also took on the job of songwriter for “Moana,” which follows a Polynesian princess who sails out on a daring mission with demigod Maui to fulfill her ancestors’ unfinished quest. Let’s just say it was a tough balancing act. “It was pretty surreal,” he said of working on both projects at once. “The ‘Moana’ team was pretty cool when I was still making changes to ‘Hamilton’ ― they kind of left me alone for that stretch of time. Then once we opened, it became a part of my routine. Honestly, [working on ‘Moana’] was one of the things that kept me sane during the ‘Hamilton’ phenomenon. Articles are being written and my heroes are showing up to see the show, but I knew I had music due every Tuesday and Thursday ― I’d have a Skype meeting with the creative team of ‘Moana’ ― so it forced me to clear up my day; it forced me to say no to parties and to say no to the things that you can get caught up in and forget why you are where you are.” The 37-year-old spent two days a week writing music and lyrics for “Moana,” living “a bit of a monastic life” in between “Hamilton” performances in order to “sail around with Moana and Maui in my mind.” “Having an excuse to sort of shut out the world, which had gotten very loud in that year, to help create this young woman’s journey ― I mean, it kind of saved my life,” Miranda admitted.  Eventually, Miranda and co-composers Mark Mancina and Opetaia Foa’I headed to California for numerous off-site meetings, where they’d watch screenings of the film and have a real say in how the story was being told.  “You’re not sitting with execs in a tower. You’re sitting with people who are making all the other movies in the studio’s pipeline. You’re getting notes from Jennifer Lee, the director of ‘Frozen,’ and from the people who make the things – your fellow artists,” Miranda said, explaining that there were many iterations of “How Far I’ll Go” before he landed on the ultimate version. “This is not the story of a young woman who gets where she is in one week; this is the story of a young woman who loves where she is and loves her people and loves her island, and she hears this voice anyway. She hears this voice saying, ‘Go, go, go!’ So that’s when it really started to take shape. Once we embraced the complexity, the song really took off into its final form.” The pressure to deliver a Disney hit ― reminiscent of “Part of Your World” from “The Little Mermaid” or “Colors of the Wind” from “Pocahontas” ― was palpable for Miranda, who soaked up every bit of information he could from “Frozen” songwriters Bobby Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez. He wanted his lyrics to be conversational but still “elevated and beautiful.” “[But] once you sit down at a piano, you have to forget about all of that,” he said. “You have to just put yourself in Moana’s shoes or Maui’s shoes [...] and live inside their skin and talk to yourself to reveal the truth, and then you write it down. In that terms, it was just like writing ‘Hamilton’ or ‘In the Heights.’ You just have to act your way through it until it feels real.”  And real it felt, as Miranda could possibly win an Oscar for his work on the beloved tune. (And, again, MacPEGOT.) Despite all these goings-on in his life, Miranda hasn’t slowed down. Although his run as Alexander Hamilton on Broadway has ended, the actor is currently in rehearsals for “Mary Poppins Returns,” which he’s starring in alongside Emily Blunt. “It’s a giant ‘effing musical,” he said. “I feel really comfortable because coming from the theater, I know it’s a luxury to have a lot of rehearsal, but you don’t always get that when you’re making a movie. So for me, it feels like a theater project that we’re getting to put on film. I keep joking like, ‘When do we start previews? I can’t wait!’ I am dancing harder than I have danced since ‘In the Heights,’ because I didn’t dance that much in ‘Hamilton,’ and so getting to do that has been really fun, exciting, liberating. It’s been really good.” If (and we mean IF) Miranda doesn’t win the Oscar this time around, it’s pretty clear he’ll be in the running again soon enough. You know, because he’s Lin-Manuel Miranda.  The Oscars air on Sunday, Feb. 26, at 7 p.m. on ABC. "
ARTS & CULTURE,"To Protest Trump's Travel Ban, Museum Temporarily Removes All Work By Immigrant Artists","Museums around the country have responded in big and small ways to President Donald Trump’s highly contested travel ban, which bars immigrants from seven Muslim-majority nations and indefinitely blocks Syrian refugees from entering the U.S.  The Davis Museum at Wellesley College in Massachusetts is just the latest. On Wednesday, the museum announced that it will be de-installing or shrouding all artwork by immigrants, as well as any art given to the museum by immigrants. The decision to remove the work is meant “to highlight the invaluable contributions that immigrants from all over the world have made on our society and culture,” the museum wrote in a press statement. Echoing the American Association of Museum Director’s statement on Trump’s executive order, the Davis Museum describes the deinstallation ― dubbed “Art-Less” ― as a “protest” that will take place from Thursday, Feb. 16, until Tuesday, Feb. 21. The Davis Museum will be taking down or hiding 120 works of art in total, including paintings, bronze and wood sculptures and ceremonial masks from European, American, African, contemporary and modern collections. The initiative will amount to a censoring of 20 percent of the objects on view in the Museum’s permanent collections galleries. The impact of “Art-Less” on the African galleries will be particularly stark ― nearly 80 percent of the galleries’ objects were donated by the Klejman family, who immigrated to the U.S. from Poland after World War II. “Every permanent collections gallery will be affected by the subtraction of works created by or given to the Museum by an immigrant to the United States,” Claire Whitner, assistant director of curatorial affairs and senior curator of collections, explained in the statement. The museum will note the removal or obfuscation of works with labels that read “made by an immigrant” or “given by an immigrant.” (Work that cannot be removed will also be draped in black cloth.) In fact, the Davis encourages other “sympathetic institutions” to download the labels in an effort to broaden the “Art-Less” initiative.  One of the “subtracted” works will be a recognizable portrait of George Washington that was painted by the Swedish-born artist Adolf Ulrik Wertmüller. Wertmüller immigrated to the U.S. in the 1790s. His oil painting was given to the Davis Museum by the Munn family, who also emigrated from Sweden after World War II.  The decision to remove work from its collection might seem counterproductive to some, but the Davis Museum seems to believe that the temporary absence of art will highlight how reliant art museums are on immigrants artists and benefactors.  The “Art-Less” protest comes after the Museum of Modern Art’s decision to hang more art by artists from Muslim-majority nations on its walls. MoMA’s Chief Curator of Drawings and Prints Christophe Cherix described the endeavor as a “clear reaction” to Trump’s travel ban that was meant to express “solidarity with artists from different countries.” The Museum of the City of New York has similarly taken action, staging an exhibition called “Muslim in New York” that pays tribute to the legacy of Muslim life in the city’s five boroughs."
ARTS & CULTURE,Philip Pullman Is Dropping New Anti-Authoritarian Fantasy Trilogy,"Desperate for a new anti-totalitarian dystopia to channel your Trump-era anxieties? Philip Pullman has you covered. Pullman, the acclaimed British author of the fantasy series “His Dark Materials,” recently announced that he will be publishing The Book of Dust, the first installment in a planned trilogy, in October. The book will feature Lyra Belacqua, the protagonist of “His Dark Materials,” though the events of The Book of Dust will take place when Lyra is still an infant. He has described the book as revolving around “the struggle between a despotic and totalitarian organization, which wants to stifle speculation and inquiry, and those who believe thought and speech should be free.” The apparent parallels between contemporary political concerns and the events of The Book of Dust are not mere coincidence, according to Pullman. “I might not be writing about Donald Trump or Brexit or Nigel Farage directly in ‘The Book of Dust,’” he stated in an interview with the Associated Press. Nonetheless, he said, the “questions they pose and the situations they set up are very much part of the world that I’m writing about.” Readers familiar with Pullman’s wildly popular “His Dark Materials” trilogy won’t be surprised by his inclusion of provocative, politically charged themes. The Golden Compass (published as The Northern Lights in the U.K.), The Subtle Knife and The Amber Spyglass saw young, street-smart Lyra drawn into a massive conspiracy engineered by a corrupt and repressive religious order, the Magisterium, that strongly resembles the Catholic Church. Lyra, who lives in a parallel universe where each human’s soul is housed in an external daemon companion and where witches are real, crossed paths with Will Parry, who stumbled over from our dimension in pursuit of his lost father.  The series blends earnest fascination with physics, metaphysics and spirituality with a critique of organized religion. (Pullman, who has openly stated that he wishes the “wretched” Catholic Church “will vanish entirely,” has identified himself as an atheist.) Despite occasional controversy surrounding the book’s anti-organized religion bent, the series has sold 18 million books worldwide and spawned a 2007 film starring Nicole Kidman as malevolent Magisterium authority Mrs. Coulter. The new series, which Pullman describes not as a prequel or sequel but an “equel” to “His Dark Materials,” will focus on inquiries into the nature of “Dust,” a mysteriously powerful substance much feared by religious leaders in the original series.  As copies of George Orwell’s 1984 sell out on Amazon and Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale hover at the top of the site’s best-seller list, there’s no denying that our collective appetite for tales of dystopian worlds ruled by theocratic and totalitarian oppression is at a peak. In an era when terms like “fake news” are being bandied about to discredit objective journalism and science, there’s no one better than Pullman to infuse our stacks of anti-authoritarian reading with a fresh saga about free speech and inquiry. The only downside? American and British reader have to wait until Oct. 19 to read the first book. We’ll be counting the days."
ARTS & CULTURE,'Brown Girls' Web Series Creator Says Joy Is A Powerful Political Weapon,"For HuffPost’s #LoveTakesAction series, we’re telling stories of how people are standing up to hate and supporting those most threatened. What will you stand up for? Tell us with #LoveTakesAction. The concept of political art may elicit thoughts of carefully designed protest signs, upside-down flags and other distorted emblems of patriotism. And rightly so: artists, now more than ever, are using their craft to comment on the state of the union and to encourage progress.  For Fatimah Asghar, poet and creator of a new web series called “Brown Girls,” political acts aren’t always so overt. Her show, which premieres this month on OpenTV, is a comedy about two friends, Leila and Patricia, navigating dating, sexuality, personal finances and other millennial woes. But the show, while personal, is also political, Asghar says.  “If this show, or other comedic projects, provide spaces of joy and resistance during a political upheaval, I think that is amazing,” she told The Huffington Post. The project, which she calls a love letter to the myriad communities she belongs to, was borne of her friendship with her best friend, singer Jamila Woods. The two live in Chicago and provide one another with emotional and creative support. The trailer for “Brown Girls” shows a similar connection between Leila and Patricia, as the women drink beers in bed, talk with their mothers about feminism, and vow their commitment to “single girls club forever.” A willingness to show life’s more private moments on screen has earned the show comparisons to “Insecure” and “Atlanta,” two series Asghar watched and loved after writing her own. Below, Asghar talked with HuffPost about her new series: When and why did you start writing “Brown Girls”? I started writing “Brown Girls” in the fall of 2015. I started writing it because I love film and TV and have always thought of it as an intimidating form, but it was something that I always wanted to try. So I kind of just was like, fuck it ― I’m going to do this. And I wrote a story that was loosely based on the life of me and my best friend, because I don’t often see women of color from different racial backgrounds being friends in TV or film. When they are portrayed I feel like they are often in competition with each other, and I don’t like that. That’s not true to my life.  You’ve described the show in other interviews as personal, or as a love letter. How much of the show is drawn from your own life?  The two main characters, Leila and Patricia, hold the same identity traits as me and my best friend, Jamila Woods. However, they are by no means identical representations of us, nor are all the events autobiographical. What I wanted to make sure to capture was the texture of our friendship, that was my biggest priority. In some ways, I think both Leila and Patricia have personality elements from me and Jamila in them and are kind of alter-egos.  The series is a comedy. What do you think is the role of comedy when there’s so much serious political upheaval?  I believe that joy can be our greatest weapon during tough political times. When I protest, when I fight against things that I don’t believe in, it’s all out of love. It’s based on my love for the people who are affected by said issue or political turbulence. That’s what I hoped the show would be ― a love letter for the different communities of color that I am a part of, and a joyous celebration of friendship and identity. If this show, or other comedic projects, provide spaces of joy and resistance during a political upheaval, I think that is amazing.  In a statement you recently issued on your Facebook page, you noted that the majority of your crew are people of color, women or queer. Why was it important to you to be representative down to the people behind the camera?  I think that diversity in the crew is incredibly important. The crew controls the mechanics of how the show is shot and seen. And when I worked in theater, even if there was a racially diverse show onstage, that diversity was rarely represented by the crew. The excuse I heard over and over again was, “Oh we can’t find talented enough people from diverse backgrounds.” That’s just completely false. What we wanted to do was create an amazing crew, all masters in their own craft, on this show. We wanted to have a crew that reflected the diversity of the cast and story, as well as the people creating art from various communities in Chicago. And so we did. And I think it’s a real testament to how amazing the crew is that they were able to work on a limited budget to create such a high-end project.  What TV shows or web series are you loving right now? I love “How to Get Away with Murder” and “Scandal.” I’ve been a big Shonda [Rhimes] fan for a long time. I also recently watched and loved “Atlanta” and “Insecure.” I love the friendships in “Atlanta,” the way that the show followed the relationships between these three men. I also think that show was doing such interesting things formally. Issa Rae has always been a huge inspiration, especially her journey from web series to network. I also love this web series called “Ladies Room,” which is hilarious.  Know a story from your community of people fighting hate and supporting groups who need it?

ARTS & CULTURE,Eve Ensler Wants To Topple The Patriarchy With 'Revolutionary Love',"Sick and tired of roses and chocolates this Valentine’s Day? Eve Ensler and the One Billion Rising campaign have an alternative V-Day event that might strike your fancy. Come Feb. 14, One Billion Rising will opt less for cards and candy and more for awareness of the violence endured by women and girls. As it has done every year since 2012, the organization ― which takes its name from a stark statistic claiming one in three women around the world will be beaten or raped during their lifetime* ― will host a series of “risings” in over 200 countries that advocate for the victims of such violence and rail against the impunity that persists in its wake. In New York City, however, the V-Day rising will be unique. Dubbed “Artistic Uprising ― A Call For Revolutionary Love,” the event is not only aimed at shining a light on the women and girls at risk of violence, but also on “refugees, immigrants, Muslims, LGBTQI people, black people, the indigenous, the poor” ― individuals who find themselves under threat in America’s present political climate. “Activists will RISE against the neo-fascist, racist patriarchy taking hold in governments throughout the world, against bigotry, Islamophobia, homophobia, transphobia, anti-immigration, nativism, white nationalism, climate change denial, imperialist and capitalist aggressions, misogyny and hate,” One Billion Rising wrote in a press release for the NY-specific rally. “From Standing Rock to financial deregulation to the ‘Muslim Ban,’ activists will demand the new regime’s agenda be dismantled.” In a conversation with The Huffington Post, Ensler, the writer and activist behind “The Vagina Monologues,” explained that “Artistic Uprising” will honor various marginalized communities while maintaining a particular focus on women’s rights in the United States.  “We’re seeing an assault on women [here],” Ensler told HuffPost. “This administration has not only escalated [rape culture] but has really normalized it,” she added. “So we are rising for immigrants. We are rising for African-Americans. We are rising for LGBTQIA. We are rising for women. We are rising for everyone in this country who is under siege, which is just about everyone except for white men for as far as I can tell.” The rally will feature performances and speeches by over 25 artists and activists ― singers, dancers, hip-hop artists, spoken word poets, drummers, gospel choirs, Ensler ― as well as a participatory project from the Where We Meet artist collective, called the “Ranting Box.” Inspired by the silencing women like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) have experienced under the leadership of President Donald Trump, Ensler and the Artistic Rising organizers are encouraging rally participants to combat hate with love. “Everything that’s done is backed up with state violence on one level or another, right?” Ensler said. “Everything that’s done is done with an aggression and a force and lack of consent, right? A disregard for laws, a disregard for rights, a disregard for what people want, a disregard for people’s feelings, a disregard for people’s safety. And I think we have to model the opposite of that.” For Ensler, the opposite of that is “revolutionary love.” “We have to model listening,” she added. “We have to model empathy. We have to model being unified and understanding that anyone they’re coming for ― they’re coming for all of us. We have to be willing to stand up each time one of us is come for. And I think the only way we really do that is [...] with fierce, unabiding love. Just really give ourselves, for the most marginalized, who are under the greatest threat and to do that with love. To do that with generosity. To come out of our silos and our own communities and reach further than we’ve ever reached before.” “Artistic Rising” will take place in New York’s Washington Square Park. It is the latest in a series of protests, rallies and strikes that have erupted in the city following Trump’s inauguration in January. If you’re not based in NYC, Ensler has some advice for those interested in taking part in One Billion Rising’s events: What we’re seeing right now across the planet is this determination from women and men to say, “We will not accept fascism. We will not accept hatred. We will not accept misogyny. We will not accept racism.” So I urge everyone to find a rising near you and to rise and dance for what it is that you want ― for the communities that are under siege that you want to protect. *The global population is north of 7 billion, which would mean that a total of over one billion girls and women encounter this level of violence. As the group notes online, women and girls is an inclusive term reflecting all those who were assigned and/or identify as female. Additional reporting from Alanna Vagianos."
ARTS & CULTURE,"It's Galentine's Day, So Lin-Manuel Miranda Made A Playlist Dedicated To Ladies","To some, Feb. 13 is simply another box on the calendar ― 24 hours removed from a holiday both revered and reviled, but another day just the same. To other, more enlightened individuals, Feb. 13 is Galentine’s Day, an occasion for women to celebrate their female friendships in the style of Leslie Knope. (If you haven’t seen that “Parks and Recreation” episode, well, it’s the best Galentine’s gift you could receive.) One such enlightened individual is Lin-Manuel Miranda, the “Hamilton” creator and potential MacPEGOT-er who can put together a rousing Spotify playlist in his sleep. This Galentine’s day, he’s done just that, compiling a holiday-specific mixtape that pays homage to iconic ladies in music history.  Queen Latifah, Florence, Santigold ― the girl gang’s all there. And unlike the Grammys, Miranda gave Beyoncé (Destiny’s Child, to be exact) the No. 1 spot she deserves. Enjoy Galentine’s Day, ladies."

ARTS & CULTURE,How The Grammys Gloss Over Great Indigenous Music Being Made Today,"Chimes like raindrops ripple across a soundscape of vaguely spiritual chanting, made ethereal by digital remastering. The sound is inoffensive ― calming, even. A cedar flute, a traditionally Native American instrument, introduces itself and flits off. Recorded in 2000, “If I Could Tell You” is one of Yanni’s many contributions to New Age, a musical genre that was given an official Grammy category in 1987 and is still around today.  The label ― like so many others in the ever-evolving world of music ― is hard to define. Since its inception it’s been wedded to the New Age spiritual movement, a Western mashup of non-Western cultural practices. And while there are exceptions ― Native American musicians who work within the genre, and others who do their best not to override the cultures their work draws from ― artists like Yanni, who lightly brush over a wide swath of indigenous musical traditions, are regularly rewarded for their efforts. On the cover of his live album “The Dream Concert,” an image of Yanni holding up an index finger in a “number one” sign is transposed over Egypt’s ancient pyramids, where the project was recorded. Blue and red fireworks burst in the background, in an all-too-literal image of colonization and Western triumph.  Yanni ― a Greek musician who’s been combining keys and synth with older instruments like the bouzouki since his 1984 album “Optimystique” ― doesn’t set out to appropriate, but to blend different traditions under an overarching philosophy of “one world, one people.” His efforts have raised funds for NASA and PBS.  It’s an artistic approach that subjects itself to parody. The bad exes in rom-coms such as “Forgetting Sarah Marshall” and “Serendipity” rock long locks and well-meaning, earth-loving ethos. But it’s also an extant reality in the music industry. In 2012, when a number of Grammy categories including Native American, Tejano and Regional Mexican were axed, New Age remained. This year’s New Age nominees include White Sun, a group that performs yogic mantras, lead by Santa Monica-based vocalist Gurujas; Vangelis, the composer whose work falls under the more orchestral side of New Age, and who’s scored films including “Blade Runner” and “Chariots of Fire”; John Burke, a pianist whose latest album emulates the formation of mountains by tectonic shifts; Enya, who draws on Celtic traditions; and Peter Kater and Tina Guo, who recorded an improvised album, harmonizing piano and cello. In previous years, the New Age umbrella also often covered artists using traditionally Native American instruments in inventive ways. Since then, those musicians have been siloed into a separate category called Regional Roots, one that is meant to honor North American indigenous music, including Polka, Hawaiian, Mexican and Cajun. The culturally crowded category is one of the few avenues for these artists to get recognition; although other genres like pop and rock may draw from their influences much in the way New Age does, nominations in those categories are typically awarded to more mainstream artists.  So, how can we make sense of New Age — its beginnings and what the genre has become?  In a 1988 article about the genre, the Los Angeles Times wrote, “rock and avant-garde enthusiasts who are generally learning that whatever their musical interests may be ― from Third World music to John Cage ― there is something about the adaptability of new-age music to different sensibilities that makes it a force to be reckoned with.” It’s a potent description, one that recognizes that genres serve a marketing purpose but don’t always align with artists’ intentions. New Age appealed to listeners who wanted to relax and to immerse themselves in cultures different from their own. As New York Times music critic Jon Pareles wrote in 1985, as the genre was emerging, “New Age music shows up at restaurants because it doesn’t distract anyone from the food; it’s just there, oozing along.” The production of such music often comes at a cost, though: by blending and softening sounds like the Tibetan drum or the cedar flute, band leaders, often white men, can distort the original meaning or intention rather than honoring it.  Although his records are sold in its bins, Yanni has spoken out against the New Age label, which he says implies placidness, whereas he hopes his music encourages more active engagement. He’s not alone in shunning the classification. Several artists who’ve won or been nominated for New Age Grammys describe their work in different terms. Paul Winter, a saxophonist and band leader who’s won Grammys in Traditional Folk, World Music and New Age, categorizes his work as “Earth Music.” His discography includes such album titles as “Wolf Eyes” and “Spanish Angel.”  Other artists reject the New Age label because their work rigorously builds on their own cultural traditions, rather than merely slipping another culture’s influence in, regardless of its history or relevancy to the project. R. Carlos Nakai, a musician of Navajo-Ute heritage whose accomplishments with the Native American flute earned him an honorary doctorate from the University of Arizona, prefers the label of Contemporary Indigenous to New Age.  That didn’t keep him from earning 11 Grammy nominations across four genres, including eight in New Age. Of his placement in the genre, Nakai told The Huffington Post, “I was more technically involved than just making melodies and putting them out there. There was a whole teaching philosophy that came with it. Of course the Grammy situation’s not involved very much in that.” A producer at Nakai’s long-time record label Canyon Records, Stephen Butler, elaborated. “It was when the Native American flute came along, and it was perceived to be a very relaxing sound, something that was conducive to meditation, yoga, massage. These were things that were embraced by the New Age community, and that’s how Native American flute music then became embraced,” he told HuffPost. “There’s this fascination with Native Americans as being an ancient tribal people. So from the side of some of our Native American musicians, who of course don’t create music with that motivation ― they’re creating it as an expression of their culture ― it’s painful.” Another musician who’s worked with Canyon Records, John-Carlos Perea, who self-identifies as Mescalero Apache, German, Irish and Chicano, voiced his criticisms of the New Age genre as employed by the Grammys. Although Perea’s won a New Age Grammy for the work he did as part of Paul Winter’s consort, he regarded the project not as a New Age album, but as a tribute to Native American saxophonist Jim Pepper, whom he was writing his dissertation on at the time. About his fellow bandmates, Perea told HuffPost, “they were all jazz musicians, they were all working musicians, they were trying to play. The genre label didn’t come into it until after, so I guess that’s why I say I wouldn’t necessarily support [the genre]. From my experience, it’s at that level of commodification that the appropriation does become problematic.” “New Age doesn’t cut it,” he continued. “The associations people have with that are justifiably problematic, and we should be critical of them [...] If you’re not seeing diversity in terms of the band leaders, then there’s a problem.”  And indeed, most of the New Age Grammy winners who draw upon Native American, South American, African and Eastern influences are not members of these communities. But, Butler, Nakai and Perea agree that cross-cultural collaborations needn’t always take the form of appropriation.  “I know of some New Age musicians who’ve made at minimum a reasonable effort to connect with the communities of the music that they’re drawing upon,” Butler said. “But those people are in a minority. And I think it’s because it’s so easy to [appropriate]. There’s a precedent for musicians to do that.” The precedent is already showing signs of impacting the future of the genre, which has seen a recent resurgence. Artists such as Matthewdavid ― a musician from Atlanta, Georgia, whose work blends hip-hop with ambient and even spiritual electronic sounds ― regard “the new new-age community as a refuge for people who once might’ve identified as punk.”  “Weird desert hippie mamas,” he continued in an interview with Pitchfork. Nakai, who considers himself an outlier in terms of his opinions on the matter, doesn’t take issue with cultural mashups. In fact, he’s headed a few up himself, leading bands that incorporate Tibetan and Hawaiian instruments. But, he emphasizes that his projects are about harmonizing, rather than diluting disparate sounds.  “Much of why I do that is to engage the people that I meet in a kind of dialogue vocally about how connected they are to their own cultural community. And then try to gain an understanding of how they do what they do in this moment of time in music,” Nakai said. “Rather than looking back, I’m more interested in looking forward into the future and seeing what the possibilities are, especially with instrumentation and electronics.”  Perea agrees that collaboration has the potential to be constructive. In addition to making music, he’s an educator ― an associate professor at the College of Ethnic Studies at San Francisco State University. At the beginning of each semester, he encourages his students to consider stereotyping and appropriation afresh. They discuss the Washington Redskins; they consider cowboy-and-indian movies.  “I think a lot more students are interested in American Indian music right now because they’ve seen the Standing Rock protests in the news, and so they’re trying to increase their soundscape. I think as tragic as it is that that protest is still ongoing ― if left unaddressed ― as bad as it is that people are still having to fight that fight, it’s bringing people to ask questions,” Perea said.  And this, he says, is a positive development.  “When it’s objectified, when it’s cold and separate, then you can do whatever you want with it,” Perea said. “But when you try to get people to understand how these symbols circulate in their world, all of a sudden there’s that closeness that gets people to be a little more willing to have a conversation and to think about changing.”"
ARTS & CULTURE,Why One Artist Believes Ambivalence Is A Form Of Feminist Resistance,"For HuffPost’s #LoveTakesAction series, we’re telling stories of how people are standing up to hate and supporting those most threatened. What will you stand up for? Tell us with #LoveTakesAction. You wake up in the morning and how do you feel? Groggy, perhaps, from spending too much time scrolling through Twitter before drifting off to sleep. Sad and anxious because of what you read there, but cozily tucked into bed. It’s hard to know what to feel most or what to do first, so, for a while, you just kind of lie there. Ambivalence is often equated with passivity and therefore aligned with weakness. Yet the anonymous artist known as Ambivalently Yours hopes to reveal, through her work, how ambivalence can be a mode of resistance, especially for women. Misogynist stereotypes often cast women as being unable to make up their minds, showing them to be fickle in relationships or indecisive when it comes to dinner plans. However, as AY sees it, this constant ambiguity stems from a place of complexity and a rejection of societal standards. “The world benefits from people being one thing or another,” AY told The Huffington Post. “Refusing to see things in a binary language is an act of resistance against the system.” AY first began thinking critically about ambivalence about five years ago, when she was studying feminist art in graduate school while working in fashion. The two fields’ divergent languages, especially in terms of feminine expression, left AY feeling stuck in between. At work, she was the “feminist killjoy,” she explained, and at school, she was the “fashion girl getting duped by the patriarchy.” Rather than choose between the fields, and adopt the identity that properly corresponded with the victor, AY opted to remain staunchly rooted somewhere in between. “I realized I was being defined in different ways depending on where I was,” she said. “I didn’t know how to situate myself. I decided to embrace both and neither, embrace my ambivalence as an active way of being.” For centuries in art, literature, real life and the imagination, the range of roles women could safely occupy was severely limited. Madonna and whore, mother and lover, beauty and hag. Today, though the categories have eased up a bit, women are still urged to choose fixed identities that make them legible to the outside world. Many today, for example, feel compelled to choose between feminist and feminine, unable to balance some radical tenants with more traditional ones. With her art practice, AY jams the circuit, imploring women to be complicated, unsure, messy and indeterminate. “In making our identities more complicated and not trying to fit into boxes,” she said, “that’s a powerful place to be.” AY’s drawings always begin with a sheet of sweet pink paper, the artist’s favorite color. In ballpoint pen and watercolor she draws young women with Margaret Keane-esque eyes and cotton-candy-colored hair, their bodies often warped to resemble mythical monsters that had recently given up on fitting in with the human race.  “My work has been evolving from something a bit cuter to something more grotesque,” AY said. “I’m interested in that juxtaposition between softness and this other ― almost creepy ― gross aesthetic.” The women’s indeterminate bodies mirrors their ambivalence within, their jumbled insides translating into appropriately hybrid physical forms. There is something wonderfully monstrous about a woman who refuses to fit into fixed categories.   Mostly, AY prefers to draw when she’s feeling kind of off, a feeling she described as “a weird state of kind of sad for not any particular reason.” This, too, illuminates what is possible when emotions, even glum ones, are translated into creative expression or activist resistance. She often leaves her drawings in public spaces for others to stumble upon, as subtle gestures of rebellion for the unknowing passersby. Along with the drawings, AY will also leave handwritten notes that confess contradictory feelings or opinions on subjects ranging from Tokyo to boobs. One reads: “Dear boobs, I love how you fill out a dress, I hate that you could be a ticking time bomb on my chest.” She documents her generous gestures on Tumblr, where she often waxes poetic about issues ranging from fashion to philosophy to colonialism.  It’s a very internet scenario, to see AY divulge so many personal details about her life online without ever revealing her identity. It’s her anonymity, the artist believes, that allows her to be so unabashed in her expression. “I was worried if I did this work as who I am I would censor myself too much,” she said.  It’s fun to imagine AY, without knowing her human form, as one of the lopsided ladies in her images, floating indeterminately from sketchbook to keyboard. It feels that her mystique puts her fans at ease, as well. They often share intimate details about their lives on Tumblr and avidly seek her advice. Yet because AY doesn’t feel qualified to give advice, she usually responds with a drawing.  AY’s mission has remained relatively constant since she started the project in 2011. It has always been political, she said, though not, perhaps, in an obvious way. “I tend to focus on the emotions and the small moments,” she explained. “My goal is to comfort people who are struggling, not to convince the people who are making us struggle.” Next time you wake up feeling weak but passionate, nervous but comfy, there’s no need to rush out of the muddle. Lie there for a minute or two and, bundled under the covers, begin to plot the feminist revolution. Know a story from your community of people fighting hate and supporting groups who need it?

ARTS & CULTURE,Artists With Disabilities Toy With Gender Norms On And Off The Canvas,"In her 1940 “Self Portrait with Cropped Hair,” Frida Kahlo paints herself in a menswear suit, her long locks lopped off and scattered across the floor like strands of seaweed. In her hand she wields her scissors like a weapon, eyeing the viewer as if posing a challenge. The portrait casts Kahlo as an artist twice over ― not only does she render her androgynous semblance in paint, but she also constructs her gender-fluid persona in real life, over and over again, with every flowing skirt, menswear suit, floral garland or untamed unibrow.  Kahlo is but one in a long line of artists who have used their bodies and their work as sites to exaggerate, manipulate and topple conventional associations of masculinity and femininity. An exhibition currently on view at Creative Growth, titled “Gender Bender,” features contemporary artists who complicate the gender binary through observation, creativity and play ― both on and off the canvas.   Creative Growth is a gallery in Oakland, California, that represents adult artists with developmental disabilities. The gallery is attached to a studio where approximately 160 artists make work alongside a team of staff and volunteers. Not all of the artists have made work before coming to Creative Growth, but once inside the space, they are considered working contemporary artists ― no disclaimers or caveats ― and are encouraged to pursue whatever creative directions they desire. The space was established in 1974 by artist and educator Florence Ludins-Katz and her husband Elias Katz, a psychologist. Appalled by the rapid closure of psychiatric hospitals in California during Gov. Ronald Reagan’s tenure, they opened a space in their garage for former state-hospital patients to make art. In a 1990 book recounting their experience, they explain: “Even though a human being may be handicapped or disabled, this does not change his need to fulfill himself to the greatest of his capacity.’’ Over the past 40 plus years, Creative Growth has earned acclaim not only for its philanthropic mission, but for the exceptional caliber of work its artists consistently produce. One of the most renowned in the gallery’s history is Judith Scott, a woman with Down syndrome and deafness who never learned to speak. She learned to communicate while at Creative Growth in 1987 through weaving wild fiber cocoons that wrapped household objects in their tentacle-like grasp. The sculptures have since been shown around the world, including at the Brooklyn Museum, the Museum of Modern Art and the American Folk Art Museum.  Creative Growth holds approximately seven exhibitions a year, thematically organized around work the artists are already creating. “Our exhibitions result from a dialogue with the artists’ work,” Jessica Daniel, Creative Growth’s community development manager told The Huffington Post. The current exhibition, exploring the ways gender can be expressed and unsettled, is no exception.  “We review work from the studio almost daily and it’s the work itself that inspires the exhibitions,” Daniel said. “We follow the artists’ leads. In fact, a huge component of the Creative Growth process is to never direct the artists, but allow them to discover their own voice, point of view and creative practice.” The current political climate ― formed in part by policies espoused by President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos and U.S. Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch that threaten the freedom and equality of LGBTQ Americans ― made the topic all the more necessary. “It felt timely and important to engage in the larger conversations of LGBTQ rights,” Daniel said, “especially as the Creative Growth community intersects so often with the LGBTQ community.”  Two Creative Growth artists in particular often return to the imagery of gender in flux. One is Aurie Ramirez, a Filipino artist whose watercolors depict androgynous, Victorian-era, punk-rock royalty, floating atop clouds and drowning in snacks. Her paintings are instantly identifiable in that they depict a recurring visual fantasy, where rocker queens don fishnet tights, garter belts and harlequin face paint, and their clock-faced compatriots dress in snappy, pinstriped suits.  Ramirez, born in 1962, was diagnosed with autism and has difficulty communicating through speech. When she began working at Creative Growth, she fostered obsessions with the band Kiss and the Addams Family, traces of which are sprinkled throughout her images. Ramirez enacts her interest in makeup, masks and performative identities off the canvas as well. She often sports dramatic makeup, with shapes painted Bowie-style across her face.  Casey Byrnes also helped shape the show with his work. He makes ceramic sculptures of the male nude with various body parts stretched out or shrunken. The figures literally treat the human body like a clay sculpture, visualizing just how easy it is to render certain parts alien, absurd and unrecognizable.  Byrnes, like Ramirez, explores the slippery terrain between genders in his daily life, as well. The artist often wears dresses for the annual Creative Growth fashion show fundraiser. “He’s creating a gorgeous woven panel gown that he will wear on the runway this year,” Daniel said.  The remainder of the featured artists employ equally distinct and playful languages to address the more uncanny manifestations of gender expression. In Carrie Oyama’s fragile watercolor-and-ink paintings, drawn with her non-dominant hand, the lines that separate human forms wiggle and shift, a testament to the unfixed nature of being in a body. “Oyama’s delicate figures certainly relate to her awareness of the human body,” gallery associate Chloe Bensahel added, “having been a dancer in New York in the 1970s.”  Artist Terri Bowden lives with legal blindness, and befriended many people with albinism who also have sight impairments. In her work, Bowden often saps both pop culture icons and wild animals of their usual hair and skin tones, imagining what other creatures would look like if they, too, had albinism. In her featured piece, Bowden alters Michael Jackson, endowing him with white tresses and ‘80s-style makeup, making the King of Pop resemble a relative of Debbie Harry.  In “Gender Bender,” the artists of Creative Growth freely express their creative visions and ornate fantasies in a language uniquely theirs. In the safe space of the art center, they can make what they want to make and, more importantly, be who they want to be.  “Creative Growth Art Center is a place where these artists can be themselves and fully have a voice of their own, outside of whatever norms exist beyond these walls,” Bensahel said. “The artists are given the space to investigate and work with whatever fascinates them, and even if it isn’t always explicit, the work is often a result of their direct experience.” The timely show is one amongst a string of recent and upcoming exhibitions similarly grappling with questions of gender, sexuality and identity in the modern world. For Daniel, the significance is clear. “It speaks, we hope, to how artists with disabilities are also just simply artists and individuals in the world.” “Gender Bender” is on view until Feb. 24 at Creative Growth in Oakland, California.  Correction: A previous edition of this article stated artist Terri Bowden herself had albinism. We regret the error. "
ARTS & CULTURE,Behold The First 'Historically Accurate' Portrait Of Mr. Darcy,"For a novel originally titled First Impressions, Jane Austen’s Pride & Prejudice spends little time describing what one of its principal characters, Mr. Darcy, actually looks like.  This hasn’t stopped readers from surmising ― or from projecting their own favored attributes onto a character who at the beginning of the story seems priggish and by the end is cast as kind-hearted and reserved. Someone so dreamy is sure to have the boyish, devil-may-care looks of James Dean, right?  Austen does, briefly, tell us what Lizzy Bennett might look like, from the perspective of Darcy, just after he realizes he has feelings for her. Darcy confesses that she is “rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes,” and he is “forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing.” But what about Darcy? Contemporary readers might imagine the strong-jawed, kind-eyed, moppy-headed Colin Firth as the character; the actor captured Darcy’s temperament in an onscreen adaptation. But a thorough study by John Sutherland at University College London suggests otherwise, The New York Times reports.  The professor combined his knowledge of values of the period with Austen’s descriptions of Darcy’s social status in order ensure a complete dismissal of preteen readers’ romantic hopes and dreams.  According to Sutherland, Darcy “would be elegant rather than brawny.” Not a soldier but a gentleman, he’d likely have “sloped shoulders,” and no facial hair, but mid-length, powdered hair on his head. “It was all about the legs,” Sutherland wrote in his “dramatic re-appraisal” of the character. “The six-pack was unknown.”  But don’t be too hasty in writing him off; prejudice has the power of interfering with what could otherwise be a lasting kinship.

ARTS & CULTURE,Marc Trujillo: 'Nowhere And Everywhere',"Painter Marc Trujillo, who paints airports, big box stores and the occasional bag of potato chips with Vermeer-like candor, is currently having two shows: one at the Bakersfield Museum of Art and another at the Winfield Gallery in Carmel. Working with banal material, Trujillo generates scenes that attempt walk a fine line between the ordinary and extraordinary. Carefully modulated and cannily observant, Trujillo’s canvases show us that the places we barely notice can be recast as scenes of unexpected grandeur.  John Seed Interviews Marc Trujillo Marc, where did you grow up and how did your childhood shape you?  I'm from Albuquerque, New Mexico, it's big sky country like Montana and the land keeps you aware that you're a small figure in a vast landscape which makes sense to me as a worldview and manifests itself in the paintings in the way I tend to scale the figures, they're important but are held in check by scale.  As a child, I only wanted to draw and read books, so my parents put me in gymnastics which gave me a good sense of discipline and I also realized that painting was something I could do my whole life, as opposed to gymnastics which has a short shelf-life. How did your studies at Yale, and your interactions with Andrew Forge help you mature as an artist?  Graduate school is where you go to have the philosophical core you operate from thoroughly cross-examined. Andrew Forge would parse out distinctions that were fine enough to nudge and refine the way you thought. He defined 'Artiness' as 'when the aesthetic effect is a consequence of things known beforehand', for example.  William Bailey was also important to me as a model of making sure what you were doing was really painting. There are different forms and why something should be a painting as opposed to a song or novel or photograph should be a part of your intention or area of investigation from the outset. While a painting may show a place, for Bailey 'the painting is the place.’ A painting has an autonomous reality as a painting and Bailey's teaching and paintings both bear this out.  You are known for painting subject matter that others might consider banal: when did you realize that ordinariness held a special attraction for you?  The chill of the void is alluring to me. These places that are nowhere and everywhere, big stretches of concrete and linoleum give me a chill that makes me want to paint them. Also, when a painting goes too low or too high in terms of subject matter it plays to easily into people's fantasy lives, and showing something that the viewer fantasizes about is narrative poison to me.   Joyce defined pornography that way: when you show the viewer something that they want to possess.  I think he got this from Kant who said that the greatest experience you can have in front of a work of art is the ""God-like moment', which is disinterested pleasure; the pleasure you get from the paintings is not because you want what they are showing you. The low temperature of my subject matter also helps keep the painting the thing, to go back to the point about 'the painting is the place.’ If I paint something like Mount Everest or the Grand Canyon then the painting reminds you of this greater experience outside of itself, like a postcard. On the other hand if I'm painting a gas station or Costco, then the painting has a chance at being more of an experience than you had when you were there.  Tell me how the works of Jan Vermeer have informed and influenced you.  First of all by being part of what made me want to paint in the first place; my reaction to them came before my reflection about why they're so good. Then you go back and look at them as a painter instead of as a fan so that you can bring something back to you own work, Vermeer's paintings are superbly composed and balanced, the light in them is as important a character as anything in the painting, and his sense of scale is very refined.   View of Delft is a pretty perfect painting, when you're standing in front of it, it's large enough to have some physical scale to it, but intimate enough that you don't notice the size of the painting before you see what Vermeer is showing you. View of Delft is about 38 inches high, so if I'm not sure how large to make a painting, then I'll make it 38 inches high by whatever width I need for the composition.  I've made quite a few 38 inch high paintings. Tell me about one of the paintings you have on view in Bakersfield. How did it come about, and what kind of impact do you want it to have on viewers?  I think the show as a whole helps show how the work is made and am grateful to the curator, Rachel Magnus, since it was important to us  to show how synthetic the paintings are- I make them like one frame movies, building the set (The vanishing point is the first thing on the painting), lighting it, and casting it.  Making as thinking is vital to me. since I need to do a lot of drawing to more fully imaginatively own my subject as well as to distill my visual motive for making a painting of it, the muted narratives in the painting are all kept that way so that the viewer is the most important figure in the painting.   My area of investigation has come out of the work, rather than starting with a narrative and painting it, there are also cases filled with sketchbooks which I work in steadily, plein air paintings and studies from life: all of this is part of the food chain with the studio paintings at the top. It helps since some viewers might misunderstand the paintings as being 'photorealist'. Since scale is important, I hope people experience the work in person, to continue from the last question; the actual painting is the result and the test of everything that goes into it.  So, to answer your question by singling out a painting, 517 East 117th Street is 25 x 44 inches. My motive for painting this was the red carpet of meat that you get when you stand in this spot in Costco. This painting is shown along with the composition drawing for it and there's an iPad on the wall as well with various stages of the painting in progress.  This preparatory work also determines the scale and we've grown too accustomed to the fluid scale that things we see digitally has: are you looking at it on your phone or is it being projected on a wall? People mostly look at things on screens, so both scale and tactility suffer, as well as the sense of light that I take a lot of pains to calibrate out of what photography gives you, which the fixed iris of the camera rolls back.   Is it fair to say that you are -- in your heart -- a very traditional painter who sees yourself as part of a long unbroken lineage?  Bringing the long, slow, patient way of looking and making to bear on the places we've made for ourselves that are hardly meant to be looked at at all is an important counterpoint of tradition and our contemporary world.  In 'Tradition and the Individual Talent', T.S. Eliot couches a healthy relationship to tradition and that it needs to include the historical sense: 'This historical sense, which is a sense of the timeless as well as of the temporal and of the timeless and of the temporal together, is what makes a writer traditional.’ And it is at the same time what makes a writer most acutely conscious of his place in time, of his own contemporaneity.' Eliot also points up that tradition has to be earned and is not automatically inherited and opposes it to what people sometimes think of as tradition ' following the ways of the immediate generation before us in a blind or timid adherence to its successes.'  So, yes would have been the short answer but the word tradition is mostly used in the sense of following and the criticality of it gets lost sometimes.  What are you interested in outside of painting?  The sister arts, literature, sculpture, music (I play guitar some and am the first name on the music credits for 'El Mariachi', Robert Rodriguez' first movie).  Linda and I like to go hiking together and have a Rottweiler Ursa, who is a rescue dog.

ARTS & CULTURE,Tarot Readers Describe How Their Clients Have Changed Since The Election,"As fast as online discussions spread about President Donald Trump’s executive orders or odd jabs during TV shows, so do posts and Twitter threads on how best to practice self-care or reduce anxiety in a truly nonstop age of news. “Self-care” is a broad net for any combination of stress-reducing actions, from giving oneself a manicure to writing old-school style in a paper journal, from watching tea steep in hot water to deleting Facebook from a smartphone. For some, existential comfort can come in the form of divining the future, too.  Tarot cards have been used for centuries to help individuals process past events and look toward their future, with tarot readers explaining imagery and meaning to advise a client on his or her path. Often, individuals will come to a tarot reading with a non-binary question (in other words, a question that can’t be answered with “yes” or “no”) in mind. A reader’s interpretation of the cards selected from the tarot deck can provide direction for that once-murky quandary. Plagued by my own feelings of uncertainty in the wake of 2016’s election results, I wondered whether others were turning to tarot as a way to steady themselves in a tumultuous political time. I reached out to several tarot readers to discuss the significance of divination in today’s world. “When people are feeling uncertain or scared, they are more likely to seek guidance, especially the spiritual kind,” Theresa Reed, known online as “The Tarot Lady,” explained over email. “Some people choose a therapist, others may choose clergy ... and then there are those who seek out a tarot reader or other metaphysical practitioner. No matter whom they choose to work with, it all boils down to one thing: they want someone to help them find their way through the fog to a safe shore.” To begin to understand the usefulness of tarot reading in a person’s life, it does well to discard pop-culture notions of hands waving around a crystal ball and proclamations of a six-foot brunette soulmate. As Reed explains on her website, “No one has the ability to see your entire future. A reader can see what may be coming based on your current circumstances, but you can shift gears at any time.” Catherine Bowman, a poet and professor of creative writing at Indiana University who has taught classes on the tarot, explained, “I think those that seek out tarot are looking for alternative systems for meaning and in a world where the consensus and mainstream approaches for guidance are proving inadequate.” For the uninitiated, a tarot deck is made up of the Minor Arcana and the Major Arcana, with the former group of cards consisting of four suits (swords, wands, cups, and circles or pentacles). Like typical playing cards, Minor Arcana cards consist of numbers one through 10 and court cards like king, queen, etc. They are meant to represent the daily ups and downs one may experience in life. Naturally, the Major Arcana cards represent big events or stronger, longer-term energy in an area of life. There are 22 of these cards, and include imagery such as The Fool, Temperance, The Lovers and The Hanged Man. The meaning and spirituality that underlie the cards allow for a shift in perspective, one that could leave a tarot subject feeling better or more certain about future events than he did before — not unlike, as Reed said, the benefits of a therapeutic session. (To be clear, however, tarot and therapy are not the same.)  “The chance narratives that come out of tarot often present alternative paths to move through problems and day-to-day encounters that embolden the questioner, and provide creative and heartening ways to navigate through a ever-befuddling world,” Bowman explained. “A so-called irrational approach to problem-solving, tarot seems to make sense in a world that feels increasingly irrational and surreal.” “I think many people had a difficult 2016 and the election was a big cherry on top,” Mary Evans, of Spirit Speak Tarot, told me over an email. “So I have noticed a particular anxiousness, unsettledness, and desire to be grounded from recent clients.” Evans explained that each year has a card from the tarot deck associated with it — for 2017, it’s the Wheel of Fortune, “a card symbolizing drastic changes and the ultimate lack of control we have in the events our lives take. The affirmation to this card, is to let go of control and focus on how your actions can work for good.” Reed reported that, as a tarot reader, she was typically “swamped” from October through March, regardless of whether an election was on the horizon or had recently happened. However, tarot reader Lindsay Mack said that she had noticed an uptick in business toward the end of 2016. “I was doing pretty well before November, but now I’m currently booked up until March. I think people are really seeking a sense of clarity and empowerment during these times,” she said.  New president or not, the new year is a time when people naturally seek out guidelines to accomplish goals or trim negativity from their lives — be it in career, friendships, love or something else. Evans explained that she often sees clients during this time, “when we dedicate the most energy to self-reflection.” Because this new year aligned with Trump’s inauguration, Evans said she believed her clients were especially focused on taking control of their lives and accomplishing work.  “I do feel that in the wake of [the election], a subconscious security net has been taken away,” she said. “I think our past eight years of democracy, although people may have found flaws in it, allowed a certain feeling of safety. Today, many of us feel fear about the future of our country, our safety, and our rights. I think this underlying theme has caused my clients to find a new stance in developing a strength and security for themselves.” Mack echoed a similar idea, noting that major political changes can incite personal ones, that external chaos can increase one’s wish for internal harmony. “For the last three years, I’ve had the honor of serving and reading for people who were really in ‘seeking’ mode, shouldering a great deal of uncertainty and anxiety in their lives in general,” she expanded in an email. “Post election, it is the opposite. There is a far more proactive, soul-centered inquiry going on with the people I see currently. People are coming in with deeper questions, with a greater desire to be in their truth, to stand up and be of service to others in whatever way they can.” While detractors might argue that seeking comfort for oneself ultimately won’t change the course of politics, it’s possible that it might allow an individual to shore up resolve in a disheartening climate to continue working for what she believes is right. As Bowman, the professor, said, “Tarot has become an imaginative way for people to learn strategies for change, to access and see aspects of themselves that may have been hidden.” “The election is, at its core, a huge invitation to evolve, personally and collectively,” Mack said. “Thich Nhat Hanh’s phrase, ‘No mud, no lotus’ captures it beautifully. The election is the mud, and we are at choice. Do we stay stuck in the mud, in our old ways, in our fear ― or do we nourish a lotus from it? Can we choose growth and expansion through difficulty?” Using a tarot deck won’t reveal specifics on the nation’s future foreign policy or what other executive orders could be implemented. But for a reeling portion of the country, the spiritual practice can offer a sense of safety and assuredness in an era of doubt."
ARTS & CULTURE,Seattle Symphony Responds To Trump's Travel Ban With Concert Celebrating Muslim Nations,"Seattle Symphony Orchestra is the latest cultural institution to respond to President Donald Trump’s travel ban, barring immigration from seven Muslim-majority nations and indefinitely blocking entry for Syrian refugees. On Feb. 8, the orchestra will host a concert featuring music from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen ― the countries affected by Trump’s executive order. Since Trump’s order was announced on Jan. 27, individuals and organizations around the United States have publicly expressed their support for refugee and immigrant communities, and their gratitude for the immense contributions they have made to this country. Seattle Symphony expressed their allegiance through a free concert titled “Music Beyond Borders: Voices from the Seven.” As a statement from the symphony explained: “At the Seattle Symphony, we are inspired to add our voice, with the hope that we can bring together our community to celebrate the freedom of expression and open exchange of ideas which the arts have always stood for, especially in times of division and conflict.”  Join us for a free concert this Wednesday: https://t.co/0nOIpuYGxV. Because freedom of expression is a human right. #MusicBeyondBorders pic.twitter.com/5fjrrj9w1d Tickets for #MusicBeyondBorders were all gone in 6 hours, but standby seating will be available that night! https://t.co/0nOIpuH59l https://t.co/DO0noxV2xN Within hours of announcing the concert, all of the available tickets were claimed. The symphony is catering to the massive interest in the event by streaming it live on Facebook. Interested parties can tune in to the topical performance on Wednesday, Feb. 8, at 7:30 p.m. PST.  The San Diego Youth Symphony is also demonstrating its devotion to diversity in music by featuring two young Syrian refugees — and impassioned musicians — in an upcoming performance. Carla and Christine Chehadeh, sisters aged 17 and 12, respectively, took cello and violin lessons while living in Damascus before immigrating to San Diego in 2014. They will perform alongside the Youth Symphony for a Winter Inspiration Showcase & Afternoon Concert on March 12.  Musical establishments are not the only cultural platforms sharing their perspectives on the chaotic political climate. The Museum of Modern Art replaced artworks on its fifth floor gallery with works by artists from predominantly Muslim nations, highlighting artists like painter Ibrahim el-Salahi, painter Tala Madani and architect Zaha Hadid.  Countless more have used both virtual and physical channels to express the profound impact the affected nations have had on culture. Poet Kaveh Akbar rounded up poets with roots in the affected countries and shared them on Twitter. And the British publisher Comma pledged to forgo American titles in favor of Arabic writers, writers of Muslim heritage and refugees. President Trump has made it clear he wants to impede the entry of immigrants from Muslim nations into the U.S., despite opposition. Seattle Symphony will stand up to intolerance and bigotry through the universal power of music, and hopefully inspire other cultural institutions to follow suit. "
ARTS & CULTURE,One Judge’s Order For Hate Crime Committers: Read More Books,"Earlier this week, WUSA9, a local news site in Ashburn, Virginia, reported that a group of teenage boys was given an “unusual sentence” after spray-painting a historically black school with racist and anti-Semitic language and symbols.   Judge Alex Rueda ― who has librarians in her family ― saw the act as a “teachable moment,” and assigned the young men book and movie reports in lieu of community service or jail time. They will also have to do a research paper on swastikas and attend a Holocaust Museum with their parents. The assigned films include “Twelve Years a Slave” and “Lincoln”; the books include The Handmaid’s Tale, The Bluest Eye, To Kill a Mockingbird and Native Son. Newer classics including Adam Johnson’s The Orphan Master’s Son and Colson Whitehead’s The Underground Railroad, the latter of which won last year’s National Book Award, were featured on the list, too. After last year’s presidential election, there was a spike in hate crimes nationwide, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. There’s been a 42 percent increase in anti-Muslim groups since 2014, and a 14 percent increase in the total number of hate groups since the same year. Due to these increases, the American Library Association has started tracking hate crimes in libraries, including those situated in schools. But precisely how these crimes will be adjudicated is another matter. Studies do show that people who read books are more empathetic, but whether that’s causation or merely correlation is tough to control for. Regardless, versing teens in works by writers of color and women writers can only better their understanding of the world."
ARTS & CULTURE,Here Is Jake Gyllenhaal Singing His Heart Out Ahead Of His Broadway Musical Debut,"Attention, world: Jake Gyllenhaal is making his Broadway musical debut this month. How do we know? Well, we’ve known. But also, Gyllenhaal just posted a video teasing his singing chops on Facebook, and damn. The kid’s got talent. “This is what happens when Riva Marker (the badass president of NineStories) and I invite #CaryJojiFukunaga to rehearsals for our new Broadway musical,” he wrote in a status accompanying the video. Cary Joji Fukunaga, of “True Detective” fame, did indeed shoot the single-shot video, Variety reports. And you can tell. In the nearly four-minute video above, Gyllenhaal sings a song ― ”Finishing the Hat,” to be exact ― from an upcoming revival of Stephen Sondheim’s musical, “Sunday in the Park With George.” The actor, best known for his role in “Donnie Darko” (it’s true!), will begin preview performances of the show at New York City’s Hudson Theatre this Saturday, Feb. 11. The musical’s official opening night is set for Thursday, Feb. 23.  Until then, you’ve got this:"
ARTS & CULTURE,The Bottom Line: 'Homesick For Another World' By Ottessa Moshfegh,"The protagonist of “Malibu,” the third short story in Ottessa Moshfegh’s new collection, spends his time making up job applications so he can continue to receive unemployment benefits and try to coax money out of his aging uncle, who has a colostomy bag and does little but eat fatty meals in front of daytime TV. He’s handsome but pimply and given to throwing up after eating; he daydreams of the beautiful woman he’ll one day fall in love with, but treats the real women he meets like inconveniently sentient Kleenex.  Oh, and then there are his hands. “As good-looking as I was, I was scared nobody would ever marry me,” he admits. “I had small hands. They were like a girl’s hands, but with hair. Nobody marries men with hands like that.” When he goes to a meet-up he’s planned with a strange woman, he shoves his hand down her throat, enjoying that he can see how his intrusive hand bulges her neck. He recalls taking a prostitute to a motel room: “I sat down next to her and splayed my hands out on the bed. ‘What do you think about these?’ I asked. Nobody ever gave me the answer I wanted. Nobody ever said, ‘Oh, so beautiful!’” Moshfegh’s fiction is nothing if not distinctive. As in her debut novel, Eileen, the narrators of the 14 stories in Homesick for Another World are gloomy, narcissistic and self-pitying. Their lives are claustrophobic and squalid. They’re constantly squeezing their acne, having sex with people they despise, eating candy and drinking until they’re sick, developing meth addictions just for kicks, and always feeling slightly superior to their own surroundings despite their listless lives. They crave adoration, but look on anyone who gives it to them with contempt.  In one story, a man obsesses over a woman who works at a video game arcade he frequents. He finally manages to secretly court her via text, but quickly loses his interest in her once she seems attainable: “He took out his phone and reread all her texts again. ‘I am very lonely and troubled. Who are you?’ She sounded desperate, he thought. He had made a grievous mistake, he thought.”  In a story called “The Beach Boy,” a man’s wife dies suddenly after their 29th anniversary celebration on a tropical island. Initially devastated and adrift, he then catches sight of an unfamiliar face in the photos he developed from the trip. Though it’s out of focus and context-free, he’s convinced that it was a picture taken by his late wife ― of a male prostitute from the island. Suddenly, he’s revolted by her, the woman he thought was a lady, but who he’s now certain was unfaithful. “Marcia was gone for good now,” Moshfegh writes after her ashes were disposed of, “and he felt like celebrating.” The women in Homesick for Another World are equally self-involved and dismissive of their romantic partners. In one story, a woman lives with her boyfriend, who manages a dingy apartment complex while pursuing his dream of acting. She quietly loathes him, the way he clenches his muscles constantly to stay in shape, his devotion to a crystal skull he keeps by his bed, the yellow women’s blazer he bought secondhand and considers the height of manly fashion. He develops a meth addiction. She never really tries to leave. In another story, a high school English teacher spends her summers in a dying small town, subsisting on subs and drugs. She has a brief fling with a local: “I still remember the humility it took for me to agree to take him home.” She hires a heavily pregnant young woman to clean her home, then calmly ignores it when her housekeeper begins to hemorrhage on the job. The unpleasant, even grotesque behaviors of her characters seem amplified thanks to Moshfegh’s cool, matter-of-fact prose. In either first-person or close third-person narration, the blunt, unemotional words with which her characters relate their petty cruelties, addictions, and even bodily functions never ceases to be slightly jarring. In much fiction, writers draw us in by painting the relatable, lovable vulnerabilities within even their most nominally unsympathetic characters, complicating our impulse to divide the world into “good” and “bad.” Moshfegh’s stories do the reverse, confronting readers with the squicky, selfish, and sociopathic inner selves of even outwardly decent people.  Reading Homesick for Another World offers a similar experience to watching a dark comedy, like the British sitcom “Peep Show.” There’s something refreshing and funny about her unvarnished portrayal of human squalor, but also something unsettling and difficult to swallow. It’s not a book to reassure readers of the essential goodness of the human race; it’s a queasy jolt to our optimistic selves, a reminder of the lowest, most id-driven proclivities of humanity. This may sound unappealing, yet Moshfegh’s talent is a sheer delight ― and the heedless misbehavior of her characters is a reminder, needed now more than ever, that we’re not such an elevated species as we’d like to think, and that following our base impulses can lead us nowhere fast.  The Bottom Line: Moshfegh’s stories of selfish people doing foul things capture the dark side of human nature, which is easy but self-deluding to ignore. What other reviewers think: The New York Times: “If there’s a thematic thread weaving through this collection, it’s the complicated relationship between entrapment in the physical body — her characters are often probing, picking and searching with their fingertips, as if seeking beauty and potential grace — and entrapment in social landscapes.” NPR: “There’s not a story in Homesick for Another World that’s anything less than original and perfectly constructed. Moshfegh’s talent is unique, and her characters — unfiltered, cold, frequently pathetic — are all the more memorable for their faults and obliviousness.” Who wrote it? Ottessa Moshfegh has previously published a novel, Eileen, which was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize and was given the Hemingway Foundation/PEN Award. After her book, a noir novel about a miserable and self-loathing young woman who works in a detention center, was nominated for the Man Booker Prize, she notoriously confessed to The Guardian that she’d written the book as a joke to get attention. She has published her short fiction in The Paris Review and The New Yorker, among other outlets. Who will read it? Fans of shocking, provocative fiction starring intensely disagreeable characters ― and readers who don’t mind being grossed out. Opening lines: “My classroom was on the first floor, next to the nuns’ lounge. I used their bathroom to puke in the mornings. One nun always dusted the toilet seat with talcum powder. Another nun plugged the sink and filled it with water. I never understood the nuns. One was old and one was young. The young one talked to me sometimes, asked me what I would do for the long weekend, if I’d see my folks over Christmas, and so forth. The old one looked the other way and twisted her robes in her fists when she saw me coming.” Notable passage: “Her pretty, gleaming calves appeared between the rungs of the banister as she came down the steps. She’d folded the cuffs of her leggings up above her knees, which were red from kneeling on the floor. When her thighs appeared, I saw a black stain of blood at her crotch. She seemed not to know that she was bleeding. There was no way she could have seen the blood past the mountain of her belly, I suppose. She gripped the bucket with one hand and the railing with the other as she descended the stairs. ”’Oh, shit,’ she said when she reached the landing. ‘I forgot the broom.’” Homesick for Another WorldBy Ottessa MoshfeghPenguin Press, $26.00Published January 3, 2017  The Bottom Line is a weekly review combining plot description and analysis with fun tidbits about the book."
ARTS & CULTURE,An Adaptation Of George Orwell's '1984' Is Coming To Broadway,"A play based on George Orwell’s 1984 is headed to Broadway. If you prefer your dystopian narratives with uncanny resemblances to present-day political realities get your blood pumping, boy, is this the show for you!  Orwell’s 1949 classic, which you may or may not have read in ninth grade, has spiked in popularity recently because of its eerie similarity to current events. Specifically, it’s been compared to the Trump administration’s penchant for propagating contradictory versions of the truth, a classic move for The Party, the fictional authoritarian regime in Orwell’s novel. Just in time for its newfound relevance, the London stage adaptation of the current bestseller is coming to New York this summer. Starting June 22, you will be free to watch as gifted performers act their way through a regime that might begin to resemble, more and more, our political landscape. Yay! The play, co-adapted and directed by Robert Icke and produced by Sonia Friedman and Scott Rudin, is slated to open the 2017-2018 Broadway season at the newly-restored Hudson Theater. Unfortunately, it will not be scored by David Bowie. The timing for the coming play is right on point. Interest in Orwell’s 1984 particularly mushroomed after Donald Trump advisor Kellyanne Conway described White House press secretary Sean Spicer’s lies as “alternative facts.” Many described her statement ― which encouraged followers to distrust their senses and trust their elected leaders instead ― as “Orwellian.” Specifically, Conway’s attempt to disguise a lie through convoluted language recalls 1984’s practice of “doublethink,” in which a political regime attempts suppress thought and rewrite history by convincing citizens that, as Orwell put it: “War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength.” Thanks to Conway’s unintended literary allusion, Amazon can hardly keep up with the growing demand for books depicting dystopian dictatorships. If you can’t get your hands on a copy ― or, like our president, you don’t read books ― a Broadway show might be the way to go.  Spoiler alert, though: It looks absolutely terrifying. Want to read something other than 1984 but can’t ignore the raging garbage fire that is political commentary right now? We’ve got a recommended reading list for that. Correction: An earlier edition of this article misstated the play was a musical. We regret the error. "
ARTS & CULTURE,"'Drunk Feminist Films' Lets You Get Smashed And Smash The Patriarchy, Too","There are films we love because they open our eyes to unseen narratives and different ways of being, through carefully woven plots and complex characters. And there are films that we love because, during that one lazy summer between fifth and sixth grade, we watched them over and over and over again, memorized all the lines and found ourselves in unhealthy relationships with the romantic leads.  It’s this latter category that brings so many to Drunk Feminist Films (DFF) ― a space for feminists to simultaneously indulge in and criticize the many Hollywood movies whose representations of race, gender, sexuality and class are so flawed or completely absent, it’s laughable. You may not have realized as a preteen, for example, how ridiculously sex work is portrayed in “Pretty Woman,” or how creepily virginity is framed in “Crossroads,” or that not a single queer person speaks in either.  DFF offers live events, as well as webisodes and other online media, that allow women to watch films they love without letting them off the hook, providing drunken commentary that pokes fun at the shortcomings and tropes of mainstream Hollywood films. As the women state on their website, “we aim jokes at the oppressor and the system (and sometimes the fashion), not those experiencing oppression.” The first film to be drunkenly mocked by a group of hilarious and socially conscious ladies was everyone’s favorite vampire love story, “Twilight.”  Gillian Goerz, one of DFF’s founders, hate-read her way through the books and, like so many, was curious to see how Bella and Edward would play out on screen. So she drafted a drinking game that would inject some feminist exegesis into the supernatural romance. Or, at the very least, it would get her drunk. Goerz invited friends over to participate, including DFF co-founders Amy Wood, Steph Guthrie and Shaunna Bruton, and a movement was born.  After the success of the “Twilight” drinking game, the DFF team decided it would be fun to film future rounds and share them on YouTube. They also set up a Twitter account soliciting requests for more films for DFF to tear into. And they recruited a larger cast, ensuring that the DFF ringleaders would embody the diverse representation they were demanding of their movies.  “Expanding from the original four founders into a cast was so important to us,” Goerz told The Huffington Post. “It was initially four white women, and we didn’t think that was OK. We wanted to reach out as soon as people were interested in the idea. We didn’t want it to be us front and center.” Today, DFF has 13 rotating cast members who, when they’re not smashing the patriarchy, work as comedians, writers, social workers, public servants and designers. They participate in DFF both through making pre-recorded YouTube videos and hosting live events, most often held at Toronto’s arthouse theater Royal Cinema. The in-person happenings, which regularly sell out, invite angry viewers to yell at the screen, throw things, and release all the pent-up tension that comes from secretly loving “Save the Last Dance” despite knowing that Julia Stiles has absolutely no rhythm. Like none.  “I think it’s a way to sort of alleviate some of the guilt,” cast member Resh Brown said in a phone interview with The Huffington Post. “Especially with some of the movies that came out when folks were younger. Being able to enjoy those movies together but also hate on them and trash them, I think it’s a way to connect around films that bring up a lot of feelings inside.” Goerz agreed. “A lot of these movies, as Resh said, have this element of nostalgia. I think there is something about commiserating with people that helps you make peace with your own problematic past. Being able to a appreciate what was good while not ignoring what is bad is part of growing up. It’s a more forgiving way to handle all of your beliefs.” The first element of a DFF screening is choosing a film ― any somewhat lovable movie with blindspots in terms of representation or truthful, empathetic storytelling. Sadly, there are plenty of options. Past showings have included films like “The Craft,” “Gone Girl,” “Spice World,” “Bollywood/Hollywood,” and “Fifty Shades of Grey.” Some, like “Bridesmaids,” are progressive by Hollywood standards ― it features a female-led cast. However, as Goerz put it, “you can’t gloss over some of the weird racist jokes in there.”  Before showing a film to a live, drunk audience, the DFF team will do a test screening, where they’ll sketch out questions and point out details to be discussed. In “Love Actually,” for example, the “drink” triggers include “Sexy man boss” ― whenever an older male boss becomes romantically involved with his younger, female subordinate. There’s also the less political “Turt Alert!” ― a drink for every heinous turtleneck featured on screen, of which there are too many.  Many of the drinking games’ rules, however, emerge on the fly. Moviegoers shout suggestions from their seats, live-tweeters chime in using the evening’s previously selected hashtag, and DFF hosts update the audience accordingly. “It’s something we can all join in on,” Goerz said. “The hosts also say a few words about each screening before the film starts. They share their personal experience with the film and point out what is problematic, what is lovable and what is of interest.” One unifying factor aligning DFF’s chosen films ― which range from romantic dramas to thrillers to slapstick comedies ― is that most were made within the last 30 years. Before then, Brown explained, films were often so problematic and dated, she felt uncomfortable even recommending them. “We want viewers to get something from the film beyond hate-watching,” she said.  Although older films are often more glaringly exasperating in terms of on-screen representation, both Brown and Goerz are dubious of whether film is substantially more diverse today. “Maybe we have more general diversity, but do we have true intersectional feminist film?” Brown asked. “’Star Wars’ had a white woman leading it, but very few other women in the entire movie. There has certainly been some progress, but I think we’re a long way away from true representation and a genuinely diverse set of stories.” Goerz agreed. “Even when you do see some representation, it can feel tokenistic,” she added. “It can feel like one step forward, 10 steps back.” Meaningful diversity and representation in film are clearly topics Goerz and Brown have spent many a cocktail discussing. They’re well aware that true progress will require a fundamental shift in the film industry, not another actor of color on the red carpet. “I don’t want to see Dev Patel playing every role,” Brown said. “True representation isn’t just the one super hot South Asian actor over and over again.” One major problem, Goerz and Brown agree, is that too often movies are made for the sole purposes of making money, and end up repeating easy formulas sure to yield mindless, box-office hits. As Goerz put it: “What is the incentive to change if they’re still making money on ‘Transformers 17’?” Just as much as DFF rails against monolithic representation, they also campaign against lazy writing, one-dimensional characters, dumb humor and half-assed plots. Good films, they suggest, both respect and reflect their audience. “Perhaps we will reach equity when someone stops paying Adam Sandler to make movies,” Brown pondered.  Both Goerz and Brown look forward to a future in which movie studios seriously reevaluate what they are making and why. “The thing that will bring more interesting diversity to film is not only casting more people of color,” Goerz said, “but having studios shift so the crew can have freedom.” The women expressed their confidence that such a change is possible, citing BBC’s recently launched diversity and inclusion strategy as an example.  BBC’s ambitious initiative sets concrete targets to hit by 2020, ensuring challenging on-air portrayals of people with disabilities, women, ethnic minorities and LGBT people, as well as a diverse roster of employees from various ethnic and socio-economic backgrounds. “I want us to make sure we are leading by example,” Tony Hall, the BBC director-general, said upon announcing the objectives, “working with and learning from others in the industry, and using our influence to bring about real change.” The BCC’s goals show what is possible when people, and studios, take inclusion, representation and, um, good writing seriously. Until Hollywood follows suit, one thing remains certain. The ladies of DFF will be vigilant. They will be outspoken. And they will be drunk.   Watch episodes of “Drunk Feminist Films” on YouTube and see their upcoming live events schedule here. "
ARTS & CULTURE,14 Iranian Artists Explore Just How Complex Immigration And Identity Can Be,"Featured below are 14 portraits of women by contemporary artists of Iranian descent. Many, however, conceal as much as they reveal, whether they are depicting veiled subjects, using purposefully obscure photographic techniques, or painting in an abstract language. The works mirror the fragmentation and fluidity that defines so many individuals’ identities today, Iranian or not.  An exhibition called “The (Un) Draped Woman” features contemporary representations of Iranian women, rendered through the lenses of memory, experience, myth, tradition, religion, immigration, fantasy, preconceptions and the many other filters that affect one’s perspective. Navigating the relationship between art and meaning, appearance and identity, the artists communicate the complexity involved in creating a portrait ― or in comporting oneself.  As Sandra Williams, assistant curator in LACMA’s Art of the Middle East department, explained in a statement: “The work of the 14 artists in this exhibition, who are all of Iranian origin, depict women in various states of cover, yet as all their works show, external appearances, whether fully exposed or not, are rarely a gateway to comprehending female identity. Instead, these artists seek to capture a deeper truth: that identity is ever changing and what is publicly presented is only a partial expression, if that, of each woman (or man’s) true sense of self.” The group show is especially timely given President Donald Trump’s recent executive order temporarily halting visas for individuals from Muslim-majority nations, including Iran. Many of the featured artists migrated from their native country abroad, many to the United States. Their work draws from the hostilities they encountered, the assumptions they defied, and the hurdles they overcame to forge a life in a new country.  The images touch on the immense struggle of living between places, cultures and eras, offering an unorthodox angle through which to view Iranian life today. Artists like Shadi Yousefian, Firouz Farman-Farmaian, Simin Keramati and Kamran Taherimoghaddam show just show complex Iranian identity truly is.   Born in Tehran and based in San Francisco, California, Yousefian draws from her individual experience as an immigrant to touch on universal feelings of alienation and fragmentation. Her practice consists of destroying materials like photographs and letters, only to then rebuild them anew. Dashti, born in Tehran, uses photography to explore the world around her from the vantage point of her memory and personal experience. She captures traditional landscapes sprinkled with identifiable markers of modern life, visualizing the lived tension of a space caught between conventions and progress.  Farman-Farmaian ― who was born in Tehran and now lives and works in Tarifa, Spain, and Paris, France ― works in a wide range of materials including canvas, nylon, cotton, vinyl, paper, metal, oil sticks, wax crayons, sand and cement. His multimedia works revolve around the ideas of movement and memory as they apply to the life and consciousness of a self-identified nomad.  Salehi, born in Shahsavar and based in Los Angeles, acclimated to life in the United States by photographing fellow outsiders ― punks, surfers and Chicano activists in LA. He has since developed a unique method of experimental photography ― taking apart cameras and disrupting the development process ― to produce analog photographs of human beings that illuminate their depth and complexity with haunting potency.  Afsoon was raised in Iran, moved to San Francisco as a teen, and now resides in London, where she channels her collaged identity into humorous yet impactful works. Working in linocut, photography, collage and etching, the artist combines Eastern and Western traditions to tell the story of her life, at once unique and universal.  Salehi, born in Tehran and based in New York, creates videos, collages, drawings, photographs and paintings, most of which reflect an appreciation for the delicate power of paper. Her subject matter toys with the poetics of the veil ― specifically the ritual item’s ability to conceal and reveal women’s identities.  Nehdaran, born in Chahar Bagh and now based in New York, uses the language of contemporary painting to address themes very much bound up in the past, including tradition, memory, nostalgia and his own family legacy.  Keramati, who was born in Tehran and now lives in Toronto, is a multidisciplinary artist who often paints portraits of women that investigate the relationship between appearance, expression and identity. Oftentimes, the paintings challenge the traditional understanding of masks, revealing the other insidious ways society encourages women to hide or conform.  Shakoori, born in Tehran and based in Los Angeles, is an artist and illustrator who incorporates Iranian philosophy, poetry and mythology into her dreamlike images, which address the influence of native and adopted cultures on a person’s psyche and performance of self.   Fallah, born in Tehran, raised in Fairfax, Virginia, and based in Los Angeles, crafts electric canvasses that revel in the magnetic power of color, texture, pattern and form. Depicting neon jungles or overcrowded interiors, Fallah drafts impossible spaces that can only exist on paper or in the wilds of the imagination.  Monzavi, born and based in Tehran, is a documentary photographer drawn to archiving what she calls “social contradictions” ― the underbellies of Iranian life that are often forbidden and thus cloaked in secrecy. Much of her work chronicles Iran’s younger generation and the subcultures they have established on the outskirts of mainstream society.  Born in Tehran and based in New York, Taherimoghaddam works in media including painting, drawing, installation and video art, visualizing the personal effects of growing up in a homeland characterized by uncertainty, repression and violence. Through abstraction, he alludes to the inexpressible psychological and emotional residue of his tumultuous early life.  Kohan, born in Tehran and currently living in Los Angeles, uses multi-stage artistic processes to mirror the gradualness and heterogeneity of the diaspora life. Using layered abstract imagery as well as text written in Farsi and Arabic, he visualizes complex experiences like love and migration that defy verbal explanation.  Ghadirian, who is based in her native Tehran, takes photographs inspired, in part, by her life as a modern woman living among religious dictates, outdated traditions, stereotypical assumptions and gendered prejudice.

ARTS & CULTURE,Bolshoi Prima Ballerina Describes The Emotional Intensity Of Dancing 'Swan Lake',"For Bolshoi Ballet prima ballerina Svetlana Zakharova, dancing the roles of both Odette and Odile in “Swan Lake” was one of the most technically challenging experiences of her life. Aside from mastering the proper way to move her body like a hybrid creature ― part woman, part bird ― Zakharova had to communicate a complex range of emotions without ever saying a word.  “Every ballerina that’s danced this ballet, and has danced it well, can say she’s made it,” Zakharova explains in the interview above. “Because this ballet is so difficult, not just technically, but also on an emotional level. It’s so complex. You need to be 100 percent sure that you have the full technique, that you will be interesting to the audience, that during the White Adagio, people won’t be able to tear their eyes away from you.” In Bolshoi in Cinema’s production of “Swan Lake,” Zakharova stars as both Odette, a princess turned into a swan by an evil sorcerer’s curse, and Odile, the princess’ dark mirror image, a tempting chimera born of the prince’s wicked imagination. The ballerina has performed in 12 different versions of the legendary Tchaikovsky ballet around the world; this round will feature choreography by Yuri Grigorovich. For Zakharova, Odette ― or the White Swan ― is the more difficult role to dance. “The clean movements, the openness, the defenselessness is so much harder to perform than the drive, the kind of aggression, the vivacity of the black swan, where all the emotions are immediately clear,” she said.  “But the White Swan ... there’s a constant quest. You’re always searching for the position of the arms, head. It’s always a duet with your partner, so many nuances, especially in the White Swan. And being so exposed, so that it really looks beautiful ― so that it touches the audience ― is the hardest thing to interpret.” See Zakharova dance “Swan Lake” on Sunday, Feb. 5, at cinemas around North America.

ARTS & CULTURE,"This Queer, Immigrant Illustrator Starts Every Morning With A Work Of Activist Art","For HuffPost’s #LoveTakesAction series, we’re telling stories of how people are standing up to hate and supporting those most threatened. What will you stand up for? Tell us with #LoveTakesAction. What constitutes political artwork? Well, it depends. For the majority of Americans ― namely those who aren’t straight, able-bodied, cis-gendered, white men ― simply depicting the banal realities of daily life has long been a political gesture. As Los Angeles–based artist Shing Yin Khor told The Huffington Post: “I do believe that the personal is political, and have always felt that writing about myself ― as a brown, immigrant woman ― is by default a political gesture because our voices are incredibly underrepresented in all creative fields.” Shing predominately works in sculpture and installation art, but a few years ago, she began publicly sharing her autobiographical comics. Her cartoons tackled subjects like heartbreak, masturbation, adventure travels and greatest fears ― many topics that aren’t often explored from the perspective of a woman of color.  “Even if I am just making work about my time spent in national parks,” Shing said, “I am pointing out that brown women also hike in national parks, which is a particular narrative that is usually centered on the experiences of white people.” However, since President Donald Trump took office, Shing, who is also bisexual, noticed her work changing tenor. “I can’t stop my work from arcing in a political direction,” she said, “when my actual identity as a human being is something the Trump administration wants to unconstitutionally deny basic rights to.”  For many Americans, life under Trump has not been business as usual. An executive order against people of one religion along with the dread of other restrictive orders that may come have led some people to question their daily habits and responsibilities, reevaluating whether their life choices are still valid, effective, enough. Shing, too, contemplated giving up her practice to go to train as an abortion provider or civil rights lawyer ― something that could have a more direct social impact. On the day of Trump’s inauguration, Shing planned to spend the day in bed. While scrolling through social media on her phone, she landed on a photo of a woman who became one of the day’s most celebrated heroes: an older Asian-American woman in a purple parka, her two middle fingers raised toward the heavens like a boss. “It was an impulse,” Shing said of the decision to paint the woman she affectionately dubbed #ResistanceAuntie. “The painting took 10 minutes, I quickly posted it on my social feeds, and ... It just kind of spread.” Shing’s painting quickly went viral, receiving over 2,000 likes on Twitter. She soon posted a link to a high-resolution image of the artwork, available for use under a free culture license. This too, was a protest in itself. “I am a strong proponent of Creative Commons licensing and release as much of my art as I can for free under a license that allows for non-commercial derivative works,” Shing said, adding, “I will continue to do whatever little I can to change the way that people interact with art [...] and invite everyone to adapt my art as they see fit.” That was Day One of Trump’s presidency, and Shing has far from slowed down. Following the president’s executive order banning refugees from Syria and temporarily blocking travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States, the artist felt obligated ― like many around the country ― to take action. Except, as a working artist, she had limited funds to donate to organizations advocating for immigrants and refugees. Also, as Shing put it, “I am kind of an anxious and introverted potato and even thinking about going to the protests made me feel terribly anxious.” Nonetheless, she wanted to contribute in an impactful way. On Saturday evening, when many protestors swarmed airports around the country to protest Trump’s ban, Shing decided to set up a live-stream on her computer so others could watch her paint the Statue of Liberty, the symbol of promise and freedom that greeted countless immigrants as they approached American soil.  Shing planned to sell the resulting paintings for $50 each and donate all proceeds to the ACLU. She estimated she’d make about 10 over the course of five hours. The people, however, wanted more, and Shing pulled an all-nighter to deliver. She ended up painting 40 pictures of Lady Liberty over the course of 13 hours, raising $2,000 for the ACLU.  “The whole art marathon was an impulse I thought about on the way home and launched just an hour later,” Shing tweeted the following morning. “But it works, so let’s do it more.” Another tweet thanked her many supporters: “You’ve given me faith that making art instead of being at a protest is NOT useless civic action.” In the future, Shing hopes to participate in similarly challenging feats of endurance art, with proceeds benefitting those put at risk by Trump’s administration.  On Tuesday, she tweeted a drawing of Nora al-Awlaki, the 8-year-old American girl killed in a U.S. military raid conducted Sunday in southern Yemen, noting that she had resolved to wake up each morning and paint a child killed by Trump’s administration. “I hope I will not be doing this every morning,” she clarified in a later tweet. “I usually meditate, but it’s not quite working lately, so I might as well just stay angry.” The world prays that Shing will not have to start each morning with a portrait like Nora’s. Nonetheless, the artist is determined to push onward with her activist art practice. And she’s not alone. Every morning, I'm going to try and paint an American child killed by the Trump administration. pic.twitter.com/iTaTHDGjc6 “I am very much inspired by artist friends of mine who are continuing to do both their work and advocacy at the same time,” Shing said. She mentioned Mari Naomi, who maintains the Cartoonists of Color Database, who recently edited and curated a comic series called State of Emergency, featuring cartoonists’ responses to the Trump administration. There are plenty more. “My friend Steenz coordinated a zine series with many other artists called Take Comfort, Take Care, and hands them out at protests. My friend Shivana made this great image about starting activism, that is, bringing activism work to light in a very approachable and simple way. My friend Autumn will be teaching a zine workshop at her mosque in Canada,” she said. “There is so much good work happening every single day.” Still, Shing occasionally struggles with how best to participate in the effort to resist Trump’s policies. In times of uncertainty and anxiety, she often turns to an essay Toni Morrison wrote in 2004 following the re-election of former President George W. Bush, when the iconic author was overwhelmed by feelings of powerlessness and despair. A world without art, Morrison reminds her readers, and herself, is a world without imagination, empathy, critical thinking and dreams rooted in truth. As Shing put it: “We need artists. We will always need artists. In trying to prevent our worlds from imploding, we can’t forget to also continue make progress towards the world that we want to live in. For me, that is a universe full of equality and justice, but also beautiful art and good stories that explain the diverse and exciting human narratives that we all embody.” Follow Shing Yin Khor on Twitter or visit her website.

ARTS & CULTURE,Dictionaries Are Tracking Trumpian Word Usage To Update The English Language Accordingly,"How much power does an American president have? Enough, apparently, to issue executive orders considered unsound by ethicists. And enough to alter the language we use, as evidenced by dictionary updates centered on heads of state past and present. The Guardian reported Monday that lexicographers are tracking the use of Donald Trump–related pejoratives, including “Trumpertantrum,” “Trumpkin” and “Trumponomics.” “We have collected evidence of all of these words and are actively tracking them to see how usage develops,” Katherine Martin, head of U.S. dictionaries at Oxford, told The Huffington Post. “Whether they are eventually added to our dictionaries will depend on the extent to which evidence continues to proliferate.” Oxford Dictionaries makes a distinction between words added to its digital database, Oxford Online, and words added to the more permanent Oxford English Dictionary. The former is a fluid snapshot of the language at present; the latter is a historical resource that never removes entries. For a word to be added to Oxford Online, its use has to be more than a trendy blip, but it doesn’t need to have been in the lexicon for decades, as is often the case with the OED. Martin said that “Trumpertanrum,” which spiked in use for a month last February after Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) coined it, “does not appear to be gaining ground as a part of the lexicon.” But “Trumpkin,” as used to describe the president’s supporters, “has been used in a variety of contexts and sources over a longer period of time and continues to amass evidence.” The word’s other use ― to describe Trump-inspired jack-o’-lanterns ― only saw “significant but ephemeral” use around Halloween last year. As for “Trumponomics,” Martin says similar words have caught on varyingly. “’Reaganomics’ and ‘Clintonomics’ were widely adopted, but ‘Bushonomics’ and ‘Obamanomics’ far less so,” she said.  One word Obama’s legacy did leave behind: “Obamacare,” which Oxford Dictionaries defines as “an informal term for a federal law intended to improve access to health insurance for U.S. citizens.” The wording of the definition is intentionally nonpartisan, as are the example sentences listed below it. “Oxford Dictionaries endeavors to provide factual, unbiased definitions and sample sentences for all words,” Martin said. “This is particularly important when the words are of a political nature.”"
ARTS & CULTURE,A Book Of Hillary Clinton's Personal Essays Is Coming,"What was running through Hillary Clinton’s mind during the 2016 presidential election? Now the world may know.  The Democratic presidential hopeful is working on a book of personal essays that will feature quotes that have inspired her in order to “tell stories from her life, up to and including her experiences in the 2016 presidential campaign.” The book is set to be published this fall by Simon & Schuster.  “These quotes have helped me celebrate the good times, laugh at the absurd times, persevere during the hard times and deepen my appreciation of all life has to offer,” she said in a statement shared by the publisher. “I hope by sharing these words and my thoughts about them, the essays will be meaningful for readers.” Clinton will also be publishing an illustrated children’s version of her 1995 book It Takes a Village, with proceeds going to charity, according to the Associated Press. Since her devastating November election loss to Donald Trump, Clinton has been spotted enjoying civilian life by going on peaceful hikes and perusing quaint bookstores. No doubt, we’re all ready for her return. "
ARTS & CULTURE,"In Response To Muslim Ban, Publisher Will Only Release Books By Authors From Affected Countries","Days after President Donald Trump issued an executive order preventing refugees, immigrants and visitors from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering America, protesters flooded international airports to voice their disapproval. Thousands of academics, including Nobel laureates, signed a petition opposing the ban. Celebrities such as Kerry Washington, Judd Apatow, Miley Cyrus and Seth Rogen voiced their thoughts on Twitter, many of them airing support for the ACLU, which sued the White House over the ban and achieved a stay on Saturday night. All of this coincides with President Trump’s unprecedentedly high disapproval rating, which spiked above 50 percent according to Monday’s Gallup poll.  Now, writers and publishers are chiming in, too. According to a post on The Guardian, a slew of best-selling authors have spoken out against the ban. And a British nonprofit publisher, Comma, took its criticism a step further. The press, which specializes in translated work, announced that it will only publish books by authors from the affected countries while the ban is in effect. “We’re heartened to see the wonderful demonstrations taking place at airports across the States over the weekend. But we’re sickened by this new side America, as a nation, is showing the world,” publisher Ra Page told The Huffington Post. “Personally, I’d much rather hear voices from Somalia, Yemen or Iran than have to listen to yet another news report about the new show business that is U.S. politics.”  Comma has an impressive backlist of titles by Muslim authors, authors whose work is translated from Arabic, and authors who are refugees. Perhaps their best-known writer is Hassan Blasim, whose short stories about war in Iraq were translated into English by Penguin Books. Covering his collection The Corpse Exhibition in 2014, HuffPost wrote, “Blasim’s stories give shape to an absurdist world in which brutal violence is commonplace.” Today, Blasim is unable to travel to the U.S. But, he said in a statement to HuffPost, he had no plans to visit the country after a 2014 trip, during which he felt treated “like a criminal or a terrorist although he had a visa and an invitation as a writer.” He’s one of many writers published by Comma facing these restrictions. His collection Iraq + 100: Stories from Another Iraq, the first-ever anthology of sci-fi set in Iraq, was published recently in the U.K., and will be published in the U.S. this year. One of its featured writers, Anoud, lives in New York currently, but questions whether she’ll be forced to return to her hometown, Mosul.  “She still doesn’t know where she stands as an Iraqi-born, British-raised writer based in New York,” Page said. “It’s not just writers of course, it’s thousands and thousands of ordinary, innocent people.” In solidarity with these writers – as well as the authors collected in Comma’s Sudanese anthology The Book of Khartoum – Page found the decision to “culturally boycott” America an easy choice to make. “There is a world beyond our friends in America, and we need to turn around and listen to it, give it a platform, hear its stories,” Page said. “Not just continually ‘other’ it.”"
ARTS & CULTURE,Black Lives Matter Art Show Organizer Wants To 'Wake People Up To Injustice',"When it comes to her Black Lives Matter art show, artist and organizer Carla Cubit has one goal: “Get people to wake up.”  For years, Cubit has orchestrated exhibitions and performances around social justice themes ― themes she believes are often overlooked by the mainstream art world. Her first undertaking, “Occupy Art,” took place in 2011 during Occupy Wall Street at the Lower East Side’s Theater for the New City. Cubit, who herself crafts mixed-media assemblage sculptures using found and discarded objects, invited poets and performers to participate in the pop-up political event.  More recently, Cubit’s shows have revolved around Black Lives Matter, addressing issues related to police brutality and the private prison industry while providing a safe space for thoughtful discussion, expression and community.  “The political climate has changed but I’m still interested in the same social justice themes,” Cubit told The Huffington Post. “Open the discussion, get people aware of what’s going on in the world around them. Wake people up to injustice.” Much of Cubit’s programming for the pop-up exhibition is interactive, meaning the show won’t fully take shape until viewers show up and participate. In the past, the artist hung banners on the gallery walls with statements including, “Your Thoughts on Black Lives Matter,” inviting visitors to share their perspectives with their community. Responses included, “Focus on the progress ― not hate: otherwise, they win” and “Love your blackness,” with some comments sparking full conversations that blossomed on the gallery walls.  Cubit’s upcoming show will feature a talk from Monica Octavia of the Museum of Impact, billed as the world’s first social justice museum, as well as a jam session featuring Welf Dorr of Underground Horns, Ras Moshe Burnett and Kenny Wollesen. Cubit will also open the stage to other poets and performers interested in participating in the evening’s events; all they need to do is show up.  The event is free for all attendees, but the artist will be selling handmade jewelry with messages like “Black Lives Matter” and “Not My President” for $1 each. Posters from the Stop Mass Incarceration Network will also be available at no cost.  For many, the time to support local organizations advocating for racial justice and artistic expression is now. As Cubit put it, the show offers a chance for viewers “to see things other than pretty flowers and trees in the contemporary art world. Something that makes a statement.” “Black Lives Matter Art Show” will take place Tuesday, Jan. 31, from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. at The Living Gallery in Brooklyn."
ARTS & CULTURE,Amy Adams Explains Her Relationship With The Aliens In 'Arrival',"For those who have seen already seen “Arrival” ― or don’t care about spoilers ― the pleasant surprise of this 2016 Amy Adams-led movie is that despite the vague marketing, the plot isn’t actually a full-on sci-fi disaster movie. With a winking, dialogue-heavy script about the importance of communication, “Arrival” triumphed the very idea of making a connection between storytellers and listeners. In a new video provided exclusively to The Huffington Post, Adams and linguistic consultant Jessica Coon explain how the movie pulled off such a storytelling accomplishment. (The clip also appears on the the digital HD and Blu-ray release of “Arrival,” released Tuesday and Feb. 14 respectively.) Adams admits that after meeting with a language expert and reading up on the general field of study, she decided the source material for the script was still a bit over her head. “I realized I wouldn’t be a good linguist,” joked Adams.   Watch the full trailer for “Arrival” below:"
ARTS & CULTURE,Searches For 'Betrayal' Spike After Spicer Is Asked To Define It,"Press Secretary Sean Spicer may not want to define the word “betrayal,” but Merriam-Webster will gladly do so. The publishing company said that the look-ups for the word “betrayal” had spiked on Jan. 31, shortly after a press conference with Spicer. In the conference, Spicer addressed the recent firing of Acting Attorney General Sally Yates. President Trump fired Yates for refusing to defend his executive order barring refugees and others from seven majority-Muslim nations, and for sending a letter opposing the ban to the Department of Justice. Trump issued a memo about Yates’ refusal that indicated she “betrayed the Department of Justice.” After a reporter asked about Spicer’s use of the word “betrayal” regarding Trump’s assessment of Yates’ actions, another asked, “Why use the word betrayal?” This led to Spicer being asked to define the word. He insisted he wouldn’t.  But, as dictionaries are wont to do, Merriam-Webster is here to educate us on what it all means. Their definition is as follows: “Betrayal is the noun that came from the verb betray, which has several meanings, including ‘to deliver to an enemy by treachery,’ ‘to fail or desert especially in time of need,’ ‘to reveal unintentionally,’ and ‘to disclose in violation of confidence.’ Betrayal means ‘the act of betraying or fact of being betrayed.’” So, there you have it. You can infer for yourself whether or not it was the right word for what Yates did. These are just the facts."
ARTS & CULTURE,'1984' Sales Have Skyrocketed. Here’s What To Read Next.,"Last week, after Kellyanne Conway gave an interview describing falsehoods as “alternative facts,” sales of George Orwell’s decades-old classic 1984 spiked. The book, a part of so many high-school syllabi, appears to be helping people contextualize political rhetoric; the sales boost even led Michiko Kakutani at The New York Times to write an homage to the still-relevant novel, headlined “Why ‘1984’ Is a 2017 Must-Read.” But, as The New Republic pointed out, it’s not the only title that can offer valuable insight. Writer Josephine Livingston suggested that Franz Kafka’s The Trial might be a more salient comparison. Sophie Gilbert noted in The Atlantic that Sinclair Lewis and Hannah Arendt books have also seen sales boosts in the past year. When it comes to undermining the media, controlling the dissemination of information and political leaders’ contradictions, there’s plenty of literary precedent. If you’ve read Orwell and are looking for more novels on these topics, there’s a range of dystopian and realistic fiction grappling with censorship and propaganda. We’ve collected a few below: Marra’s connected stories span generations, showing how history erodes certain truths and throws others into relief. The first story is about a more concrete kind of censorship; its protagonist works in Joseph Stalin’s Department of Party Propaganda and Agitation, literally removing faces from paintings and newspapers. When he fails to do his job, haunted by the face of a familiar-looking ballerina, there are consequences. The dystopian world imagined by Graedon isn’t so dissimilar from our own, which is what makes her novel particularly frightening. A sort of neurological disease has the potential to infect the tech-obsessed, making them no longer able to communicate clearly. Deeper readers remain more or less immune to the affliction, anchored as they are in context.   Barnes’ latest novel isn’t a dystopian one, but an intimate look at the life of an artist under tyrannical watch. Composer Dmitri Shostakovich goes unnoticed by Stalin until the ruler makes his negative thoughts on his music clear. He’s neither killed nor exiled, but instead made to represent Soivet ideals, forcing him to question which is more valuable: his art or his life.   In his review of Mandanipour’s novel, the critic James Wood reminded readers that “tyranny is the mother of metaphor, and all that.” In other words, a novelist hailing from a country where censorship is a literary restriction might get creative with his storytelling methods. Such is the case in this love story, centered on what can and can’t be communicated publicly about a private relationship.  Ah, teens. Their tendency to spew righteous, thinly researched nonsense is annoying, but it’s harmless ― endearing, even. Right? Not so in Marcus’ experimental novel, where the language of young people is physically harmful to their parents. Naturally, chaos follows; unethical testing practices ensue, and the novel’s hero, Sam, strikes out on his own to find a cure. Which is all to say that words are as capable of harm as actions.  When we imagine censorship, we imagine good citizens silenced by overt governmental mandates, finding clever new ways to express themselves in spite of noxious restrictions. In Eggers’ novel ― soon to be adapted into a film ― censorship is more complicated than that. It stems instead from a well-meaning corporate culture gone awry. At the Circle ― a Google-meets-Facebook conglomerate ― openness is valued over privacy, and self-censorship arises as a result.  Another beloved book soon to be adapted for the screen, Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale is about a religious fundamentalist movement that occurs swiftly, oppressing women in its wake. In this imagined dystopia, called Gilead, women are issued uniforms and are separated from their families. They’re also not allowed to read ― knowledge, after all, is freeing.  If the choppy-sounding title of Shteyngart’s most recent novel ― Super Sad True Love Story ― doesn’t sound to you like Doublespeak, maybe the 1984 connection will be made clearer by its premise. In a near-future society where personal devices and individual “scores” are obsessed over, relationships are stripped of their nuance and intimate connection is nearly impossible. Sad! In Johnson’s portrayal of North Korea, the government is prone to doing one thing while publicly declaring that it’s doing an entirely different thing. It’s a tactic that, on an individual level, can lead citizens to question their own perceptions of reality; on a large, governmental scale, the method of control is even more potent. To illustrate the rift between private and public knowledge, the book is told both from a first-person perspective, using the language of sheeny propaganda.  An apolitical playwright — American born, German raised — stays in Germany during World War II, and joins onto the Nazis’ propaganda campaign. After the war, he returns to America, where he eventually becomes a symbol of a white supremacist group. The story, like Vonnegut’s Bluebeard, is written as he narrates the writing of his own diary.

ARTS & CULTURE,Artists Are Offering Free Drawings In Exchange For ACLU Donations,"There are obviously urgent and ethical reasons for donating to the /www.aclu.org/blog-feed/breaking-news""}}"">American Civil Liberties Union today. But in case you needed extra incentive, artists are here to sweeten the deal. Emily Flake, a cartoonist for The New Yorker, posted a message on Instagram Sunday promising to mail a free drawing to anyone who emailed her a receipt after donating $50 or more to the ACLU. She attributed the idea to comic artist Sarah Glidden, whose graphic novel Rolling Blackouts puts the refugee crisis in visceral and comprehensible terms.  Donate $50 to the ACLU today and I'll mail you a drawing. pic.twitter.com/pukV8fuo0n Glidden, in turn, thanked artist Cathy G. Johnson for the idea. In 2016, Johnson created fundraising drawings in support of the Legal Support Fund in Ferguson, Missouri, following the killing of Michael Brown.  This weekend, Johnson tweeted out support for Glidden and all artists using their gifts to fight President Trump’s assault on American values and human rights. Other artists quickly followed suit, demonstrating the ways creative skills can contribute to political opposition and activism.  xoxo Every artist should do this, we should use every tool at our disposal, in this together!! https://t.co/E0G34x5hzP (The ACLU is challenging Trump's Muslim ban) https://t.co/5XKbM3DXeB pic.twitter.com/IQFLFDjkO3 (H/t @sarahglidden ) Donate to @ACLU and I’ll draw u a wrestler pic.twitter.com/j0sIOMWDME  So here's the deal... this weekend only, if someone makes a donation to the ACLU in the amount of $50 (or more, hopefully) and sends the receipt to me along with their address, I will send them an original drawing of their favorite Greek god. I'm stealing this idea from @sarahglidden but I think she'll be cool with it ;) The ACLU is doing important work and I want to help them in any way I can.

Federal judges in New York, Virginia, Seattle and Boston ruled to block aspects of Trump’s ban, protecting individuals with valid immigrant and non-immigrant visas, or who are otherwise legally authorized to enter the United States.  “This ruling preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil,” said Lee Gelernt, the ACLU lawyer who was in court Saturday arguing the case, in a statement. Although many of the artists’ offers only lasted through the weekend, your donation is more crucial now than ever. Learn other ways to fight the #MuslimBan here. "

ARTS & CULTURE,This Oscar-Nominated Documentary About Autism Celebrates The Outsider,"At the age of 3, Owen Suskind stopped speaking. His non-verbal state, his parents soon learned, stemmed from autism. Owen’s ability to socialize was replaced by a keen interest in classic Disney movies, which he watched enough to memorize line-by-line. By versing themselves in the language of Disney, Owen’s parents were able to reacquaint themselves with his inner life, and eventually help him regain his speech. Owen’s father, journalist Ron Suskind, has since presented the case to the UN, calling the progress he made with his son “affinity therapy,” a technique that’s now being studied by psychiatrists. Suskind also wrote about Owen’s story in a book published by Disney imprint Kingswell. The book has since served as the jumping-off point for a film directed by Academy Award winner Roger Ross Williams, whose documentary “Life, Animated” is up for an Oscar this year. The movie opens at a crossroads: Owen, a young adult, is preparing to live independently. He tells his own story to Williams, explaining his interest in Disney heroes, villains and plots. He also shares his own creative endeavor, a story he wrote called “The Land of Lost Sidekicks,” a world filled with roaming characters who’ve been left behind by their heroic counterparts, who’ve gone on to fulfill their destiny. In Owen’s story, which Williams says is parallel to Owen’s life, the sidekicks have to find their inner heroes. “That, to me, was screaming to be animated,” Williams told The Huffington Post in an interview. “This film was really about giving people like Owen ― people that have been left behind, people that don’t have a voice ― a voice.” And Williams ensured that the film didn’t editorialize Owen’s story, but rather, provided a platform for Owen to narrate his own goings on. He’s the only person who speaks over the course of the film, and his story, “The Land of Lost Sidekicks,” is brought to life as an animation, so viewers can literally enter a product of his imagination. “That was a way for the audience to have a direct connection to Owen as he narrated his own story,” Williams said. Williams emphasized that the message of his film, ultimately, is about the enduring power of storytelling. Although Owen’s stories of choice ― classic Disney films ― were cultural touchstones and spoke to the time in which they were made, they were adapted from centuries-old fairy tales.  “Owen has grown up on a diet of myths and fable and story,” Williams said. “We all need story to survive, but this is about the power of story to transform one life in such a profound way.” Williams says that making the film was an informative and inspiring experience; heading into the project, he knew very little about autism, and now he feels strongly about supporting the journeys of autistic individuals.  “What I learned is that there’s a whole population of people ― a growing population of people ― living with autism, who have so much to offer the world, and we can learn so much from them. We’re losing out if we toss them aside and look past them,” Williams said. “I’ve always felt myself like an outsider. I think I connected with Owen on that level. Here I am, a black gay man, from really outside of the mainstream. Owen is someone who he says people look past, and I think we connected on that level.” The year, Williams is one of five black directors nominated for an Oscar in the Best Documentary Feature category.  “In this day and age, we need hope, and we need that message that everyone ― we’re all ― everyone should be included. And that’s the theme in all my work. I want to tell the story of the outsider, and humanize the outsider. I think no one would be left behind.”"
ARTS & CULTURE,'Roe v. Wade' Play Shows How Much Is At Stake For Young Women Today,"In 1970, 26-year-old lawyer Sarah Weddington tried her first-ever contested case before the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas. It was Roe v. Wade. Most Americans alre aware of the Supreme Court’s 1973 verdict in the watershed case, but fewer know the women who got us there.  Lisa Loomer’s play “Roe,” running now at Washington, D.C.’s Arena Stage, tells the story of the case that established a woman’s right to choose to have an abortion through the lens of two people: the young and ambitious lawyer Weddington and the case’s plaintiff Norma McCorvey, a 20-something bartender and lesbian who, in court, was known by the legal pseudonym “Jane Roe.”  In 2013, Loomer was approached by a friend about the possibility of writing a play about the case as part of a cycle of performances called “American Revolutions,” each recreating a moment of change in American history, commissioned by the Oregon Shakespeare Festival. Given Loomer’s previous work with narratives centered around women’s struggles, Roe v. Wade was of obvious interest.  “I was interested in the case, yes, but I was also interested in why this case is still being argued 44 years later,” Loomer explained in an interview with The Huffington Post. “I wanted to understand why we, as Americans, cannot even talk to each other about this issue. In other words, I was interested in the divide in this country, and I thought that by looking at the divide over Roe, I might begin to look at the larger cultural divide, as well. Which is, ironically, what we are looking at right now, post-election.” After an initial run in Oregon, the play premiered in D.C., just days before Donald Trump’s inauguration. Before the election, Loomer imagined the production existing in a different context. “We imagined it happening during the inauguration of our first woman president,” she said. “We thought it would be a cautionary tale, as history should be, but also a celebration of how far women’s rights and human rights have come,” she added. “Clearly, we were surprised. The play is happening now in a totally different political climate.”  The unexpected turn of events made “Roe” and its implications even more urgent, as Roe v. Wade’s ruling is now under unprecedented threat. One of Trump’s first actions as president was reinstating Ronald Reagan’s abortion “global gag rule,” which bans health organizations around the world receiving U.S. funding from mentioning abortion as a family planning option. And last week, Trump met with Judge William Pryor as a potential Supreme Court Justice, a man who called Roe v. Wade the “worst abomination in the history of constitutional law.”  In writing “Roe,” however, Loomer’s mission was never to convince her audience of the importance of abortion to women’s liberation. Rather, she wanted to tell the complex story of the iconic court case with tolerance and compassion, giving voice and credence to both parties.  “I did not want it to be a polemic,” Loomer said. “I did not want to further the divide. I feel that theater is a place where people — all kinds of people — can come together in the dark to look at an issue from a human point of view.  Theater is a place to feel. To laugh, cry, be surprised, and to live in another’s shoes for a while.”  Loomer tells her story through two protagonists: Weddington and McCorvey. At first, the women worked together on the case as allies. Yet, after the verdict, McCorvey became a born-again Christian and an anti-abortion activist. Weddington continued to champion women’s right to choose. “Their divergent journeys,” Loomer said, are representative of a broader picture. “Once I saw that odd turn of events, I thought it was a chance to tell the story of the cultural divide and look at why we can’t talk to each other as Americans.” In “Roe,” Loomer depicts the complex web of biases, fears and personal motivations that all humans grapple with regardless of their political affiliations. She also seamlessly highlights the effects that race, class and sexual orientation have on one’s opportunities and worldview. As a result, no minister, activist or millennial is stereotyped. There are no clear heroes or villains, just people ― messy, dedicated, and trying to do what’s right. During the play’s Washington run, Loomer speculates that most, but not all, of her audience leans liberal. Yet she’s received feedback from viewers on both sides of the political spectrum who appreciated seeing a nuanced and respectful picture of the other point of view. “Most people say that they went in very firmly sure of their stance, and they left sure of their stance, as well,” Loomer said of audience members who identified as both pro-choice and anti-abortion. “It didn’t change their mind, but it gave them an appreciation of the other side. For the first time, there was another side.”  In the future, Loomer hopes to take “Roe” to a theater in the southern United States, where the audience’s political breakdown would likely shift. The goal, again, isn’t to change minds, but to raise the possibility of open dialogue.  “My best hope is always compassion, a reverence for the complexity of human beings,” she said. “I think we can use that compassion now. I know it’s a time when people are extremely angry, and the last thing they want is to be asked to show compassion. Unfortunately, I just don’t know another way of even beginning to bridge this terrible divide in our country except for just listening to the other side. Just hearing it.” She also hopes to reach the young people in the audience, those who thought Roe v. Wade was another generation’s story. As Loomer said: “I think that people come away from the play with a deeper understanding of what is at stake, right now, in terms of choice.” “Roe,” a co-production with Oregon Shakespeare Festival and Berkeley Repertory Theatre, is written by Lisa Loomer and directed by Bill Rauch. It is on view until February 19, 2017 at Arena Stage in Washington, D.C.  Correction: An earlier edition of this article misspelled the playright’s name as Loomey. We regret the error. "
ARTS & CULTURE,Hamilton's Schuyler Sisters Are Singing At Super Bowl LI,"If we’ve learned anything from their performances in the Broadway hit “Hamilton,” it’s that actresses Phillipa Soo, Renée Elise Goldsberry and Jasmine Cephas Jones know how to work. And work they will at this year’s Super Bowl. It was revealed by The New York Times on Friday that the three women, best known for their roles as the Schuyler Sisters in “Hamilton,” will be performing “America the Beautiful” during the Super Bowl pregame show next month. Your girls are backkkk & including women in the sequel. See U at the Super Bowl. 2017. @reneeelisegolds @Phillipasoo https://t.co/tFn4g2F04O We’ve already heard Goldsberry and Jones sing “America the Beautiful at the U.S. Open in September and then again in partnership with Vogue and Ralph Lauren for his Fall 2016 runway collection. So, if you weren’t already confident that it’s going to be a hell of a performance, there’s already some proof. Soo, Goldsberry, and Jones respectively played the original Eliza, Angelica and Peggy Schuyler in the musical. But all three have since moved on to other projects. Soo is preparing play the eponymous role in the upcoming musical “Amelie,” while Goldsberry is slated to appear in the upcoming Netflix series “Altered Carbon” and HBO film “The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks.” Jones it set to star in the film “Blood Surf” alongside James Franco. Super Bowl LI is slated to begin at 6:30 p.m. EST on Sunday, Feb. 5, on FOX. You can catch the “America the Beautiful” performance shortly before then."
ARTS & CULTURE,D.C. Museum Dedicated To Women In Art Broke Attendance Record Inauguration Weekend,"The weekend of Donald Trump’s inauguration, women and allies in Washington D.C. marched in solidarity, promising to “affirm our shared humanity and pronounce our bold message of resistance and self-determination.” Also, though, they saw some art.  The National Museum of Women in the Arts (NMWA) ― the only major museum in the world dedicated to celebrating the history of women-identified artists ― told The Huffington Post that inauguration weekend yielded the museum’s largest weekend attendance ever.    The museum offered free admission to visitors the weekend of Jan. 21, as well as additional programming geared toward all the nasty women in town for the Women’s March on Washington.  Initially, the museum was slated to host a “Nasty Women” tour, a guided journey through the works of women artists in the NMWA’s permanent collection who subverted gender norms and societal expectations, making some quality artwork in the process.  As Deborah Gaston, director of education at the museum, explained to HuffPost: “A nasty woman is someone who refuses to be bound by the place society defined for her, someone who blazes her own trail.” Luckily for the NMWA, their programming has always incorporated such progressive sheroes.   Day one in DC and rocking our Rosie the Riveter outfits! #wecandoit #whyimarch A photo posted by Katy Bird (@jumpsuitkaty) on Jan 19, 2017 at 2:00pm PST So many visitors, however, turned up to the NMWA, that instead of giving one “Nasty Women” tour as originally expected, the museum gave nine. In fact, inauguration weekend attendance was double the previous record for weekend attendance (with free admission), director of communications and marketing Amy Mannarino said. “We can’t say enough about the wonderful women and men that visited the museum,” Mannarino continued. “The crowd’s positive energy was palpable, and visitors filled all corners of the museum—enjoying art by women, chatting with friends, and enjoying free refreshments. We couldn’t have asked for more.” If you missed the “Nasty Women” tour, worry not. The NMWA is always highlighting the work of female artists who toppled stereotypes and challenged the male gaze. So in effect, every tour is a “Nasty Women” tour.  As Gaston put it: “In a way, this tour is special, but in a way it’s what we always do. Here, it’s Women’s History Month every month. This is a perfect time for people to notice what we are doing here, but we’re doing it all the time.” Trump’s election seems to have inspired a renewed interest in feminist art, for obvious reasons. A string of “Nasty Women” art shows held around the country have raised over $50,000 for Planned Parenthood. And a New York–based exhibition called “Uprising / Angry Women” also compiled work from female-identifying artists giving Trump a piece of their minds.  Cheers to women being creative, fearless and, of course, nasty.  This @OBEYGIANT @womensmarch poster reminds us of #BoushraAlmutawakel’s work feat in #SheWhoTellsaStory https://t.co/zu0BJhIdUA @pbsnewshour pic.twitter.com/qhtlMKvki9 First display on entering @WomenInTheArts museum showing amazing pop-up books by Collette Fu.

ARTS & CULTURE,An Exhaustive List Of Art Projects Threatened By The Proposed NEA Cuts,"In response to reports that President Donald Trump would like to slash national arts funding, artist Tega Brain has created a simple and effective website that celebrates the creative projects those plans threaten. Head to neafunded.us and you’ll find a scrolling list of art projects funded by the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) in 2016 alone. From a playwriting competition in Atlanta, Georgia, to a poetry series in Kansas City, Missouri, to a film festival in Cleveland, Ohio, to music education in Las Vegas, Nevada, the seemingly never-ending scroll ― based on the latest NEA grant report ― highlights the kinds of endeavors states could lose if arts funding dies. Hearing that the National Endowment for the Arts is under threat, I made https://t.co/N5vQik81wW to show what they fund & where. #SavetheNEA In an email to The Huffington Post, Brain, an Australian-born, New York-based artist who specializes in “eccentric engineering,” explained that she created the website after learning that the current administration reportedly intends to close the NEA and the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) amidst a larger push to slash government budgets. “It is an animated list of the incredibly wide range of arts projects and community arts organizations that receive some support through the NEA,” she wrote, noting that many of the highlighted projects on her website are not located in big urban cultural centers. “It is part of NEA’s mandate to support practices in all parts of the United States,” Brain added. “It’s well known in the art world that you’re more likely to get NEA support in remote places over city areas.” NEA funding, which makes up a fraction of one percent of the federal budget, is not only used to support artists, actors and musicians, but also producers, designers, lighting crews, cultural spaces and venues, catering companies, accountants and more, Brain reiterated. “Think about how many people you know whose job has something to do with the arts,” she said. “This is relevant to us all ... you can’t help but be struck by the range of different communities involved and by the dozens or more people that each of these small grants would benefit or employ.” According to The Independent, a White House petition to save arts funding is still not registering signatures. Only 97 signatures showed up as of the publication of this piece, and the link for reporting issues leads to an error page. When asked what advice she could offer to people who wish to get involved in advocating for or preserving the NEA, Brain replied: Do real activism. Bring people together who are concerned with this issue, or, connect with existing activist groups and initiatives who could become invested in this issue. If you are not sure how to do this, the Indivisible Guide or the Center for Artistic Activism webinar series on art and activism are good places to start. Eat together, talk and figure out ways to express dissent. Think of either the most powerful person in the arts who you know, or someone who is close to the NEA and get them onboard. Work with them to find ways to act that go beyond just being vocal on the internet. Disrupt and make this issue heard.  Check out an abbreviated list of projects featured on Brain’s website below. "
ARTS & CULTURE,Young Women Of Color Encouraged To Contribute To Solange-Inspired Syllabus,"Last year, Solange Knowles gave the world, notably black women, a powerful gift with “A Seat at the Table,” which Rolling Stone called “a record about black survival in 2016” — and her influence isn’t stopping there. According to an announcement on the Saint Heron website, Knowles’ music will serve as inspiration for a crowd-sourced syllabus focusing on issues relating to racism, self-love, gender and sexuality. Women are encouraged to submit work to the syllabus on a website dedicated to the project, which will be led by Wake Forest professor and Elle magazine editor-at-large Melissa Harris-Perry. The Saint Heron site reads: Women between the ages of 16-30 are now being asked to share their stories using texts, music, and visual art that speak to their personal experiences. These submissions will contribute to a Solange inspired syllabus. Solange’s album uncovers many truths and speaks freely on issues that directly affect women of color and it is time for all of us to join in on the conversation.   from #cranesinthesky @saintrecords A photo posted by Carlota Guerrero (@carlota_guerrero) on Oct 4, 2016 at 12:17am PDT In December, Solange opened up to Helga Davis about the conversation that inspired “A Seat at the Table.” When Solange received flack last year for expressing that white journalists covering R&B should know who Brandy is, a white writer went on a New York Times podcast to comment: “I noted who her audience was, and if I were her, I’d be careful of making these statements because I’d be careful not to bite the hand that feeds me.” “I began to think a lot about that conversation and replaying it, and it haunted me,” Solange, who recently gave away hundreds of books to Washington, D.C., fans and Howard University students, said. “And it haunted my mother to hear someone telling her daughter, ‘Don’t bite the hand that feeds you.’ And also the racial subtleties — [that] are not so subtle — of what that encompasses when you say that to a black woman.” It’s unclear whether the works submitted to “A Seat at the Table” syllabus will form the basis of a university course, an open online project, or something else entirely. We also wonder whether the album’s corresponding ebook, which includes Knowles’ lyrics and photography by Carlota Guerrero, will be a part of the project."
ARTS & CULTURE,'Hamilton' Star Wayne Brady Says To 'Fight For The Arts' In Trump Era,"Wayne Brady is thrilled to star in the Chicago production of “Hamilton” ― not only because, well, gosh, it’s “Hamilton,” but also because his stint comes at a key time in this country. Just last week, The Huffington Post reported that President Donald Trump’s administration might shut down the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. That means funding for national arts and humanities could decline, or worse yet, all but disappear. Brady, who currently portrays Aaron Burr in the musical, says with Trump in the White House, it’s more important than ever to support arts programming and initiatives, in addition to plenty of other important causes and rights that could be at risk. “It’s happened and it’s happening,” Brady told The Huffington Post. “And it’s going to happen for four more years. And the reality of it is no matter where you fall — if you are pro-Trump or anti-Trump, he is the president. And what are we gonna do?” “I think we need pieces of art like this to keep that fire burning so you just don’t fall into a slope, like, ‘Whatever, it’s four years,’” he continued. “No, during these four years, what are you going to fight for? Fight for the arts. Fight for LGBT rights. Fight for the rights of every minority who gets kicked in the ass with every one of Trump’s cabinet members being placed [in office].” Brady is no stranger to theater, having previously starred on Broadway in “Chicago” and “Kinky Boots.” So, it’s not surprising that the all-around entertainer would make a plea like this. “Go out, support the arts, [support] the things that he [Trump] is killing … By doing ‘Hamilton’ not only am I supporting arts, but I’m in art,” he said. “I’m a trumpeter for the rights of all of us, especially being a black man in this country.”  Of course, one could argue that “Hamilton” ― with its diverse cast and its historical storyline ― resonates even more now with what’s happening in current national politics. But Brady says his interest in “Hamilton” first piqued in 2015 when Lin-Manuel Miranda launched the now Tony Award-winning musical. “Ever since this began ― pre–Donald Trump circus ― it’s resonated with what it means to be an American … Like the line, ‘Immigrants, we get the job done.’ My folks are from the Virgin Islands,” Brady said, “just like [Alexander] Hamilton. It’s inspirational to know that this little chain of islands can produce such greatness.”  Brady stars in “Hamilton” at Chicago’s PrivateBank Theatre through April 9.   "
ARTS & CULTURE,Step Into A Feminist Artist's Overgrown Garden Of Girly Delights,"Whether you were one the nearly 3 million people who took part in last weekend’s Women’s Marches, or saw photos of the teeming crowds as they spilled gloriously down city streets, you likely noticed a preponderance of pink. That’s partly because women and men of all ages donned “pussy hats,” pink knitted caps with feline ear flaps, as a form of silent protest against the anti-woman agenda advanced by President Trump’s administration. Viewed from above, when protest signs became illegible, the sea of pink kept the feminist message intact. Although the color has historically been associated with feminine ideals like sweetness and passivity, on Jan. 21, the color embodied a very different vision of femininity: activated, angry and in cahoots.  “Oh my god, this color is really being embraced as a powerful thing,” artist Portia Munson explained in an interview with The Huffington Post. Munson has been obsessed with the shade for decades, both for its innate aesthetic appeal as well as all the gendered baggage that comes along with it. In the 1940s, pink was declared the “sex-appropriate” color for young girls, a decision upheld by manufacturers and retailers. The color became associated with everything young girls were told they should be: mild, charming, submissive, and of course, pretty. Munson herself always had a thing for pink and couldn’t help but wonder how her personal preference stemmed from a societal mandate. “I was trying to decide — did I really like this color? What was it about this color that was also associated with femininity?” She soon began picking up the random pink items she encountered on the street ― a plastic comb here, a tampon applicator there ― until she had amassed an unruly collection of rose tinted debris.  In the 1990s, Munson began arranging her homogeneously hued bric-a-brac into dizzying installations that put the relationship with femininity and consumption in plain view. In “Her Coffin” (pictured above), the pink found objects are so densely packed into a rectangular glass case the viewer is almost tempted to provide the inanimate goods some air holes. The sculptures powerfully touch on the smothering constrictions of femininity that limit so many women, as well as the endless, compulsory need to buy more, be more, be better.  The full-room installation “The Garden” (above) encompasses the pressures urging women towards continuous consumption. Originally shown in 1996, the piece takes the shape of a woman’s bedroom, a hoarder’s paradise packed with fake flowers, stuffed animal bunnies and vintage dresses. The dizzying space embodies the spirit of “too much but never enough.”  In ‘96, art critic Paul H-O described it as “Laura Ashley on LSD, total manic-femininity implosion with Victorian mood-lighting.” Part “Grey Gardens,” part Madonna Inn, all Marie Kondo’s absolute nightmare, the room recalls that crushing feeling of overindulging on beauty products during a misguided quest for self-care, only to fully self-loathe as a result.  The space speaks to the mentality of bourgeois femininity, in which shopping seemingly offers a brief respite from patriarchal oppression ― a short-lived spurt of self-possession through new possessions. The result, however, can be a claustrophobic den of pretty garbage, with all items amounting to a sickly sweet swamp. “It got it to the point where I couldn’t fit anything else in there,” Munson said. “That’s when the piece was finished. I like that it feels kind of magical, but also is suffocating, seductive and repulsive.” The simultaneous feelings of seduction and repulsion stem, in part, from the symbols of fertility fanatically on display. “I was thinking about flowers as the reproductive organs of plants,” Munson explained. “And the bunnies ― bunnies procreate really quickly, so I was thinking about the fertility of nature. But everything in there is dead and discarded.” The artist explores the fetishization of natural elements using cheap, artificial replicas. she alludes to the ways women are idolized as abstractions or adored as objects, yet rarely appreciated or respected in their imperfect, natural bodies. As Munson put it: “There are all these ways women try to cover their own smells, all these ways we have to obscure themselves.” In “The Garden,” femininity and plastic are one and the same. Other readings of the work have emerged between the work’s original showing in the 1990s and its reprisal in 2017. For one, the amassed materials have aged accordingly, their kitsch charm acquiring an aftertaste of mildewed madness along the way. The aging of the work mirrors the aging process of women; what was once deemed attractive grows grotesque, what was once valuable becomes obsolete. Additionally, the work’s emphasis on mass-produced replicas of natural forms speaks to our present, when our planet’s environment is in more danger than ever. One can imagine a dystopian future world where Munson’s plastic “Garden” is the only kind of garden we have access to. “At my core, I’m both a feminist and also an environmentalist,” Munson explained. “I hope ‘The Garden’ is also seen in that way.” Along with the sculptural installations, Munson has created still-life paintings of trinkets in her collection, including porcelain dolls, dildos, coral-colored egg cartons and a perfume bottle in the shape of a woman’s torso. While in her sculptures, each individual object gets swallowed up by the rest, Munson’s paintings allow the viewer to mull over just how uncanny so many of the commodities marketed to women truly are. “The paintings are quieter,” Munson said. “They’re about meditating on objects, thinking slowly about simple things.” The perfume bottle, for example, shifts from a common, household object to a bizarre spectacle through Munson’s careful attention.  “The perfume comes out where the woman’s head should be,” Munson expressed. “What does that mean? Is that what makes us beautiful?”  “The Garden” is a timely ode to the residue commercialized femininity leaves behind. Despite the fact that most of the sculptures were made in the ‘90s, they feel hauntingly fitting for the contemporary political climate, when buying a “Fuck Paul Ryan” pin or a “Nasty Woman” T-shirt feels like a small act of defiance against a crushing stream of political defeats. It’s tempting to envision a later iteration of Munson’s work, updated to include contemporary objects of “feminist swag.” There could even be a pussy hat in there.  “The Garden” runs until February 11, 2017 at PPOW Gallery in New York. "
ARTS & CULTURE,'The Devil Wears Prada' Is Coming To Broadway. That's All.,"It’s official: “The Devil Wears Prada” is coming to Broadway.  Even better? Sir Elton John will write the music along with Paul Rudnick, according to Deadline. We’re already imagining the musical number for Andy’s fashion closet makeover and Miranda’s “cerulean” speech.  “Reimagining ‘The Devil Wears Prada’ for the musical theatre is super exciting,” John said in a statement obtained by The Wrap. “I’m a huge fan of both the book and the feature film, and a huge aficionado of the fashion world. I can’t wait to sink my musical teeth into this hunk of popular culture.” A timeline for the project is still to be announced, but the show will be produced by Kevin McCollum (”Something Rotten,” “In the Heights”), Fox Stage Productions and John’s Rocket Entertainment, Deadline reports.  The story (based on Lauren Weisberger’s book of the same name) follows Andy, a post-college 20-something looking to make it in the world of journalism. She lands a job at a major fashion magazine, as a second assistant to the icy editor-in-chief, Miranda Priestly, played in the film by Meryl Streep. (Naturally, Streep earned an Oscar nomination for her work in the film.)  No word yet on who will be cast in the production, but we’ll be over here just praying that Streep reprises her role for the stage. It would put her one step closer to the coveted EGOT accolade, so really, it’s a win-win situation. "
ARTS & CULTURE,Roxane Gay Yanks Upcoming Book From Simon & Schuster Imprint,"Acclaimed novelist and essayist Roxane Gay might term herself a “bad feminist,” but when it comes to registering dissent, she knows exactly how to be heard. Following news several weeks ago that right-wing provocateur and one-time Twitter bully Milo Yiannopoulos would be publishing a book on his controversial political philosophy with Simon & Schuster’s conservative Threshold imprint, many infuriated progressives directed their outrage at the publisher itself. Readers and critics threatened to boycott the entire publishing house, and several writers published by Simon & Schuster publicly challenged the choice.  Now Gay, a well-known and influential writer, has come forward to announce that she’s asked her agent to pull a book originally slated for publication with a Simon & Schuster imprint in 2018. “I guess I’m putting my money where my mouth is,” she told Buzzfeed. The book, a nonfiction work entitled How to Be Heard, was to have been published by TED Books, a series by the influential idea-championing TED organization published in partnership with Simon & Schuster. In a statement provided to Buzzfeed News, Gay said: When the announcement about Milo’s book first came out, I was relieved because I thought I didn’t have a book with Simon & Schuster and tweeted something to that effect. Then I remembered my TED Book and that TED is an imprint of Simon & Schuster. I was supposed to turn the book in this month and I kept thinking about how egregious it is to give someone like Milo a platform for his blunt, inelegant hate and provocation. Whew. When I saw that Milo had a book deal I whispered, please don't let it be my publisher. According to the statement, she eventually told her agent to pull the book. She emphasized that she didn’t see this as an act of censorship. Milo has every right to say what he wants to say [...] he doesn’t have a right to have a book published by a major publisher but he has, in some bizarre twist of fate, been afforded that privilege. So be it. I’m not interested in doing business with a publisher willing to grant him that privilege. As of this writing, How to Be Heard still appears on the landing page for TED Books on Simon & Schuster’s website, available for preorder with a publication date in March 2018.  On Tuesday, Buzzfeed published a letter sent by Simon & Schuster CEO Carolyn Reidy to authors upset by Yiannopoulos’s book deal, which aimed to reassure writers that “neither Threshold Editions nor any other of our imprints will publish books that we think will incite hatred, discrimination or bullying.” On Twitter, Gay indicated that this reassurance was far from sufficient: @theferocity @jarry @BuzzFeedBooks eh. I pulled my book from S & S anyway. Simon & Schuster and TED did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  As for How to Be Heard ― will it ever be heard? Gay told Buzzfeed that though she hasn’t yet secured another publisher for the book, “I do hope the book is published someday.” Our bets are on this one getting snapped up in no time.  UPDATE: TED released a statement on Wednesday stating, “We’re disappointed that we won’t get to put this important book out into the world, but we respect and accept her decision.”"
ARTS & CULTURE,The Art Nerds Of Twitter Drag Trump With #TrumpArtworks,"President Trump has only been in office five days and already he has made headway on many of his most alarming campaign promises ― from preparing to dramatically restrict immigration from Muslim-majority countries to erasing Obama’s climate change initiatives. There are, of course, ways for the millions of Americans appalled by Trump’s agenda to organize, resist, and take action. And then, there’s some good old-fashioned Twitter trolling.  It’s been hard for many to resist taking a dig at Donald on the internet platform he holds so dear, and most recently it’s been the art world who has taken up the gauntlet. British humor website The Poke called upon its readers to incorporate Trump into some of art history’s most iconic works, thereby, of course, making them “much better and far more beautiful ― or at the very least more orange.”  The good art nerds of Twitter delivered, responding with classical paintings updated to reflect Trump and his team’s penchant for “alternative facts,” “pussy” grabbing, Vladimir Putin and, allegedly, golden showers.

ARTS & CULTURE,"Publisher Says Milo Yiannopoulos’ Book Won't 'Incite Hatred, Discrimination'","About one month after Breitbart News editor, former Twitter bully and alt-right poster boy Milo Yiannopoulos inked a contentious $250,000 book deal, his publisher has issued a statement. On Monday, Simon & Schuster CEO Carolyn Reidy sent BuzzFeed News a letter explaining her company’s decision publish the book, titled Dangerous. Reidy stresses in the letter that Simon & Schuster doesn’t “support or condone, nor publish hate speech” and that the company has taken the feedback it’s received seriously. She goes on to say that the choice to work with Yiannopoulos was made independently by Threshold Editions, “without the involvement or knowledge” of other publishers at Simon & Schuster.  Threshold signed the alt-right supporter on the pretense that his book “would be a substantive examination of the issues of political correctness and free speech,” Reidy states, adding that an “articulate discussion of these issues, coming from an unconventional source like Mr. Yiannopoulos, could become an incisive commentary on today’s social discourse.” Because Threshold aims to publish works for a conservative audience, a book like Dangerous “would sit well within its scope and mission.” Reidy ends the note insisting that while she appreciates the “strong opinions” the book has fueled and the debate over Yiannopoulos’ contract, final judgment “ultimately comes down to the text that is written.” “And here I must reiterate that neither Threshold Editions nor any other of our imprints will publish books that we think will incite hatred, discrimination or bullying.” When reached for comment, Yiannopoulos’ publicist Chad Wilkinson told The Huffington Post, “At this point we have nothing to add to the story.” You can read the full note on BuzzFeed."
ARTS & CULTURE,You’ll Want To Read This Scorching Satire Of 'American Values',"SUVs, red meat, Jesus. If a dissenter’s view of Middle America were turned into a Bingo card, Kate Zambreno’s debut novel O Fallen Angel ― recently reissued by Harper Perennial ― would win the game a few pages in. The short book has been described by Lidia Yuknavitch ― who also makes her political ideas known through her fiction and first published Zambreno in 2010 as part of her “Undoing the Novel” contest ― as a triptych. There are three main characters: Mommy, Maggie and Malachi. Mommy is a Midwestern housewife who prioritizes her family life and expects her children to do the same. She willfully ignores anything unpleasant, including her own intrusive thoughts that may contradict her Catholic beliefs. Maggie, her daughter, is one of those unpleasant thoughts. After dropping out of college, she mostly spends her time sleeping with men who don’t return her affections, an affliction that leaves her depressed and without the support needed to pursue medical help. Malachi is a prophetic figure bearing a sign on the side of the highway, oscillating between self-aggrandizing delusions and genuine insight into the wasteful ways of passersby. Each character is shown to us in a voice that’s uniquely Zambreno’s ― although it’s earned her comparisons to Kathy Acker and praise from Chris Kraus. Embracing the didactic language of parable while turning it on its head, Zambreno’s punchy, matter-of-fact, repetitive sentences belie repressed emotional truths. Much like the American value of pursuing objective “happiness,” the book intentionally makes use of a sunny sheen to gloss over Mommy, Maggie and Malachi’s self-doubt. The effect is a poetic visit to Middle America, one that’s more likely to expose hypocrisies than generate empathy. If there’s anything critical to be said of Zambreno’s inventive work, it’s that she’s unconcerned with plot, with character development and with all of the usual tenants of storytelling. Her language enchants, but much of the story’s events are related in passive time, so that the habits of the characters are established but never challenged or deviated from. Mommy judges; Maggie broods. So, the story’s end might be unsatisfying for readers who yearn for closure ― or at least action. Maggie’s never freed, even momentarily, of her youthful narcissism. Mommy’s never enlightened about the world beyond her pleasant, pastel-hued home. Neither is forced to reconcile her prejudices with the world beyond her own private space. And maybe that’s realistic; maybe we need a story like this to shed light how insular our ideological communities are. But it might also be cynical, or at least untrue to how most of us live our lives. Amid the smartly mocked credos and playful language of O Fallen Angel, there’s no room for awkward family dinners or phone calls, no space for the tension between these polarized views to loosen, or finally snap. Instead, we’re invited to view a still of these characters’ lives, a snapshot that doesn’t imply movement. Nevertheless, given what Zambreno’s accomplished since writing this book ― she’s written another celebrated novel, Green Girl, and an essay collection, Heroines ― it’s an impressive debut to look back on for its playfulness alone. The bottom line Original and lyrical, O Fallen Angel is centered on its ideas, not its story ― and that’s OK.   Who wrote it Kate Zambreno is the author of Green Girl and Heroines.  Who will read it Anyone interested in parables, subverted fairy tales and bold women writers. What other reviewers think Electric Literature: “Kate Zambreno’s O Fallen Angel dissects the willful blindness and rigid oppressiveness of contemporary American life.” Bookslut: “What do you say about an American gospel that beats the shit out of you?” Opening lines “She is his Mrs. and he is her Mister the mommy and daddy the two of them forever and ever and ever they will never part they will never be apart except when Daddy has to go make the bread and she has to bake it.” Notable passage “Maggie writers in her Dear Dear Diary about herself vs. the world, but mostly she just writes about how much she misses Marlon Brando and all of his predecessors (and likely successors). “The best way to get inside Maggie’s pants (heart) is to be withholding. Catholic girls crave denial. Remember that one night we were doing Ecstasy and we were so in love? she writes Marlon Brando.

ARTS & CULTURE,‘1984’ Sales Spike After Kellyanne Conway’s Orwellian Interview,"George Orwell’s novel 1984 is more than 60 years old ― but in the days following President Donald Trump’s inauguration, the classic tale of a dystopian society, where an authoritarian government uses language to control the masses, is in high demand. One edition of the book has spent several days on Amazon’s best-sellers list, climbing to number one Wednesday. The sale surge was highlighted Monday by Brian Stelter, host of CNN’s “Reliable Sources,” when the book was number six on the list.  Sales for the book increased by 9,500 percent since Trump’s inauguration Friday, Signet Classics told The Huffington Post. The publisher, an imprint of Penguin Random House, ordered a 75,000-copy reprint of 1984 earlier this week, and ordered another 100,000 copies of other Orwell titles Wednesday due to demand.  It would be difficult to pinpoint exactly what caused the spike, but plenty of people have pointed to “Orwellian” language used by Trump senior advisor Kellyanne Conway on NBC’s “Meet the Press” Sunday. When host Chuck Todd asked Conway about White House press secretary Sean Spicer’s false claim that Trump drew the largest inauguration crowds ever, Conway disputed the notion that he had lied.  Spicer instead gave “alternative facts,” she said.  “Alternative facts are not facts,” Todd countered. “They’re falsehoods.” On “Reliable Sources” Sunday, Washington Post reporter Karen Tumulty called the term “a George Orwell phrase.” “This brings us to 1984 ‘doublethink,’ where war is really peace, where famine is really plenty. That’s what’s happening here,” political historian Allan Lichtman added. Google searches for the term “Orwellian” also spiked on Sunday.  Rebranding lies as “alternative facts” is certainly reminiscent of the way language is used by those in power in the world of 1984 ― to distort, manipulate and propagandize. One of the book’s most famous quotations is the three-part slogan for the (fictional) Ministry of Truth: “War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength.” Gotta credit the Trump gang, they are ON their Orwellian jargon game.""Alternative facts"" is a pro-league totalitarian play.And on day 3! The same administration that criticizes ""fake news"" gives us ""alternative facts,"" if you're wondering how Orwellian the next 4 years will be ""Orwellian"" gets tossed around a lot. But the phrase ""alternative facts"" (to describe official lies) really is worthy of Orwell. Orwell also wrote about the way language can undermine truth in his nonfiction. In the 1946 essay “Politics and the English Language,” he wrote:   Political language ― and with variations this is true of all political parties, from Conservatives to Anarchists ― is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind. There are close to 30 million copies of 1984 in print, according to Signet. It is a standard in high school English classes and hasn’t lost relevance over the decades. Though some say we’re too quick to accuse things of being “Orwellian,” Orwell’s story has clearly helped people trying to make sense of foreboding contemporary events.  When the extent of the National Security Agency’s citizen surveillance activities came out in 2013 ― reminding some of 1984’s Big Brother, the secretive, authoritarian leader who’s always watching ― the Amazon sales ranking for one edition of the book jumped 4,000 percent overnight. This story has been updated with the book’s most recent ranking on the best-sellers list and sales information from the publisher.   "
ARTS & CULTURE,Mark Twain Wrote This Never-Before-Published Fairy Tale For His Daughters,"Everyone’s favorite satirical adventurer, Samuel Clemens (aka Mark Twain), isn’t done entertaining and enlightening us. Later this year, a fairy tale he jotted down after sharing it with his daughters in 1879 will be released as a never-before-published book. In a press release, publisher Penguin Random House wrote, “Although Twain told his young daughters countless bedtime stories, made up on the spot as they requested them, these notes are believed to be the only ones he ever jotted down from those sessions.”  The story was discovered by Twain scholar John Bird, author of Mark Twain and Metaphor. The story is less rooted in realistic political happenings than the Twain writings typically read in school, like Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. Instead, it seems that Twain dabbled in the magical elements of children’s books and fables by creating a character who, after eating a special flower, gains the power to talk to animals. In addition to the story’s original 16 pages, The Purloining of Prince Oleomargarine, out in September, will include illustrations by Erin Stead.  If it’s anything like its cover, the book will be a whimsical story a la “Big Fish” or even “Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland,” but told in delicate watercolors. Twainians, rejoice!"
ARTS & CULTURE,"People Have Book Recommendations For Trump, If He'd Only Read One","Does President Donald Trump read books? He says yes, he “like[s] reading books.” Other evidence suggests no. During interviews on the campaign trail and post-election, he’s never been able to name a book other than the Bible, his own works, and All Quiet on the Western Front unless said other book is directly in front of him.  Still, let us posit that President Trump will read entire books during his term in office. In that case, there’s good news: He need not rely on his own ghostwriters’ output, nor commemorative books sent to him by CNN, for material. The experts are stepping in. The executive director of the National Book Foundation, Lisa Lucas, offered Time’s Sarah Begley a few reading recommendations for the new POTUS. Appropriately, she suggested books that have recently been honored by her organization, which administers the prestigious National Book Awards: Claudia Rankine’s Citizen; John Lewis, Andrew Aydin and Nate Powell’s March; Arlie Russell Hochschild’s Strangers in Their Own Land; and Ibram X. Kendi’s Stamped From the Beginning. All of the books she recommended, whether in poetry (Citizen), graphic memoir for young readers (March), or nonfiction, explore marginalized American peoples. Strangers in Their Own Land is a sociological examination of the white working poor in Louisiana, which seeks to understand why people who need government assistance turn to Tea Party ideologies that reject big government. The others focus on the struggles of black Americans and the long history of American racism. Though Lucas may be one of the most qualified citizens to suggests useful reads to President Trump, she’s not alone. In December, Elle’s Sarah M. Broom listed a handful of titles he would benefit from reading, a syllabus which also focused on racial education told through an assortment of fiction and nonfiction. She suggests Impounded: Dorothea Lange and the Censored Images of Japanese American Internment, noting the parallels to Trump’s controversially proposed Muslim registry. Other recs: W.G. Sebald’s The Emigrants and the first issue of the Marvel series “Black Panther” by Ta-Nehisi Coates, Brian Stelfreeze and Laura Martin. An NPR piece by Annie Tomlinson and Vincent Ialenti took a more nuclear approach, compiling scientific reads that would help our new president navigate the current military industrial complex he now oversees. (Their recommendations have comforting titles such as Whole World on Fire by Lynn Eden and Wizards of Armageddon by Fred Kaplan.) All available evidence suggests that Trump will not go out of his way to read any of these books, and that even if a book is given to him, he will read “passages, I read areas, chapters, I don’t have the time,” as he told Megyn Kelly in an interview last year, when pressed on the last full book he read. He is, of course, busy with other activities. As Politico reported on Sunday, a source close to the president revealed that “He gets bored and likes to watch TV.” That can only mean one thing. Cable pundits, it’s time to drop everything and start marathon read-alouds from Edward E. Baptist’s The Half Has Never Been Told: Slavery and the Making of American Capitalism. Do it for America."

ARTS & CULTURE,Dark New Book Shows The Grim Reality Of Resisting Oppression,"In December, South Korean president Park Geun-hye was impeached by the National Assembly and stripped of her executive powers. Park, the daughter of former dictator Park Chung-hee, had been caught up in a scandal regarding a corrupt entanglement with a friend, Choi Soon-sil, the daughter of a famous shaman. Her approval ratings had also been down since the disastrous and deadly 2014 ferry accident that left hundreds dead, which many believed her administration’s mismanagement had caused.  Park entered office in 2013, and in 2014, novelist Han Kang published Human Acts, an elegiac examination of the 1980 student uprising in the southern city of Gwangju. The uprising, translator Deborah Smith notes in an introduction, took place not long after Park’s father, a military dictator who had held sway over South Korea for nearly two decades, was assassinated by his director of security services. His exit from the scene might have seemed like a moment of freedom, or at least opportunity. “But the assassination was no victory for democracy,” Smith writes. “Instead, into Park’s place stepped his protégé Chun Doo-hwan, another army general with firm ideas on how a people should be governed.” The brutal suppression of student protests in Gwangju ― by their own country’s soldiers ― under Chun left few illusions about a hopeful new era. Though one strongman had been dispatched of, another made in his image had grabbed hold of the country and was repeating a cruel historical pattern.  Han, who sprang onto the English-reading scene last year with the translation of her elegant and uncanny 2007 novel The Vegetarian, refracts the Gwangju Uprising through her own particular lens: her fixation on the body itself, and its connection to the soul; human tolerance for unspeakable acts; and the tearing of social fabric both by violence and by a refusal to accede to it. Human Acts is told in several parts, monologues from people bound up, in one way or another, with the uprising and its aftermath. A young boy, Dong-ho, goes to search for a friend and friend’s sister at a makeshift morgue set up at a gymnasium. Though he doesn’t find them, he stays to help tend to the bloodied bodies instead. The corpses have been retrieved after confrontations with national military forces that left hundreds of protesters dead in the street. Soldiers carted away many of the bodies, but the opposition were able to collect others and guard them until their families could come to give a proper burial.  In the gymnasium, Dong-ho is surrounded by grieving parents who have come to identify and bury their slain children. He’s also surrounded by putrefying bodies; bodies that sit unpreserved in a warm room for days without burial, waiting to be identified and taken away. The smell is overpowering. The bodies are bloated. “There are no souls here,” he thinks. “There are only silenced corpses, and that horrific putrid stink.” Dong-ho’s mother comes to take him home, as word has spread that the army is returning to seize any protesters they can find and wipe out anyone who stands guard over the bodies. He stands firm, saying he’ll come home by curfew. Somehow he doesn’t. When the soldiers arrive, finding a cluster of teenage students ― many girls ― Dong-ho is mercilessly killed, despite his tender years.  The unexpected brutality of the murder reverberates throughout the rest of the novel, told by a cast of loosely connected characters ― women protesters he met at the gymnasium, his mother, his young friend, and others. One particularly searing section, narrated by Dong-ho’s friend Jeong-dae, takes place after Jeong-dae is shot and killed at a protest. His soul hovers near his body as it’s seized by soldiers, trucked out to a clearing, and allowed to rot in a pile with other stiffened corpses. He waits, watching insects pick at his stiffened body, and seethes over the injustices that led to his death, and the deaths of his loved ones: “I wanted to sever the pure strength, that force thin and taut as a spider’s web, dilating and contracting, from the inert lump of rotting flesh. I wanted to be free to fly to wherever they were, and to demand of them, why did you kill me?” This uncut rage subsides from view as the novel spirals further from the actual events ― a former female protester, now working at a publisher, recalls those horrible days from a relatively peaceful time. Another, who was a factory worker when the uprising took place, has a job as a transcriptionist. Dong-ho’s mother occupies herself with her living sons. The final section is from the voice of a writer who, like Han Kang herself, moved away from Gwangju as a child, shortly before the uprising, but later heard about and saw photos of the atrocities and was deeply shaken by them.  The fury and the anguish haven’t faded, however. In her introduction, Smith reveals that one of the working titles of the translation was “Uprisings,” not just because of the central event, but because of how the trauma refuses to be suppressed. One narrator recalls repeatedly telephoning the Provincial Office to complain that a fountain in Gwangju has been turned back on shortly after the brutal end to the protests. “I don’t think it should be allowed,” she complains. “Now it’s back on again, as though everything’s back to normal. How can that be possible?” Human Acts, like The Vegetarian, isn’t a book about forsaking or repairing violence; it’s about the inescapability and deathlessness of violence in humanity. Every effort to paper over the horrors of what these protesters suffered, at the hands of their own nation’s soldiers, whether through time or literary censorship or personal forgetting, fails. The violence of the past rises up again; it was never really past.  In her introduction, Smith notes that former dictator Park’s daughter being elected president in 2013 reopened old wounds for many South Koreans, though she won the support of older citizens who more fondly recalled the economic flourishing of the country under her father. Her impeachment might seem to bandage that wound again, offering justice for her corruption and a rejection of her familial dynasty.  As Human Acts itself illustrates, though, it’s never that simple. Though Park’s impeachment stripped her of her powers, oddly, it didn’t remove her from office. Instead, she remains in limbo while a judicial court reviews whether her impeachment was proper. Based on the makeup of the court, it appears possible that the impeachment could be overturned. If so, she would once again wield presidential powers for the duration of her term.   The Bottom Line: A visceral, searing excavation of emotional and physical trauma that is rooted in just a few days, but spans decades.  What other reviewers think: The New York Times: “This gut-wrenching novel about the Gwangju massacre has no interest, and rightly so, in making us feel at peace. It lacerates, it haunts, it dreams, it mourns, and because of its effective use of the second-person narration, the characters call out to you — persistently — until you feel what the dead feel and, perhaps worse, what the survivors feel.” The Guardian: “Neither inviting nor shying away from modern-day parallels, Han neatly unpacks the social and political catalysts behind the massacre and maps its lengthy, toxic fallout. But what is remarkable is how she accomplishes this while still making it a novel of blood and bone.” Who wrote it? Han Kang is an award-winning South Korean poet and novelist. She teaches Creative Writing at the Seoul Institute of the Arts. In 2016, her 2007 novel The Vegetarian was published in an English translation by Deborah Smith, to great acclaim. The book was awarded the Man Booker International Prize. Who will read it? Readers who choose bleak, soulful fiction about war, death, and similar brutal aspects of human life. Opening lines: “‘Looks like rain,’ you mutter to yourself. “What’ll we do if it really chucks it down? “You open your eyes so that only a slender chink of light seeps in, and peer at the ginkgo trees in front of the Provincial Office. As though there, between those branches, the wind is about to take on visible form. As though the raindrops suspended in the air, held breath before the plunge, are on the cusp of trembling down, glittering like jewels.” Notable passage: “The blood-stiffened clothes, their rotting fibers matted to our flesh, were the first to burst into flame. After that, the flames ate steadily through the head’s thick hair, the fine down covering the body, then fat, muscle, and innards. The blaze roared up as though threatening to engulf the wood. It was as bright in the clearing as it was in broad daylight. “It was then I realized that what had been binding us to this place was none other than that flesh, that hair, those muscles, those organs.” Human ActsBy Han KangHogarth, $22.00Published January 17, 2017  The Bottom Line is a weekly review combining plot description and analysis with fun tidbits about the book."
ARTS & CULTURE,"Today, You Can Watch A Clown Read Donald Trump's Inauguration Speech","If you want to hear Donald Trump’s inauguration speech, but for any number of reasons can’t bear to look the man directly in the face while doing so, artist Rachel Mason has offered an alternative. Performing as her alter ego, FutureClown, Mason plans to lip-synch Trump’s inaugural address in a live YouTube performance taking place at the exact same time as the real swearing-in ceremony. The performance was recorded live from LACE, and it’s currently the main feature on Art F City. Given the bizarre atmosphere of Washington, D.C., on Friday morning, the clown ensemble seems quite appropriate.  Mason has long used her clown counterpart to tackle political events that seemed somewhat out of this world. In a 2013 interview with The Huffington Post, she said of the character: “It is me, and it allows me to do the things that I want to do.” Mason, as FutureClown, lip-synced the entirety of a Republican debate last year. “Obviously with Donald Trump being a viable candidate, it really blurs the line between reality and fiction,” she said at the time.  For many, watching a futuristic clown sworn in as president seems less strange than the real thing. "
ARTS & CULTURE,‘Carnage’ Is The Top Dictionary Search On Trump's Inauguration Day,"A word cloud of Donald Trump’s inaugural address would likely feature phrases like “the people” and “unite.” The subtext of his speech is another story. Trump’s promise to put “America first,” for example, is a fraught one. Historically, the phrase has been used by Nazi sympathizers. And his avowal to protect the interests of the police is brimming with racist undercurrents.  While the address ostensibly rings of promise and change, the words that were most searched on dictionary sites are alarmingly opposite in tone. According to Dictionary.com, the top look-ups during the speech were “carnage,” “radical” and “pugnacious.” On Merriam Webster, “carnage” saw a spike in searches, too. Post #Inauguration top lookups:1. carnage2. radical3. pugnacious Yeah, ""carnage"" is spiking now. Earliest meaning in English: ""the flesh of slain animals or men."" @MerriamWebster #Inauguration Merriam Webster defines “carnage” as “the flesh of slain animals or humans.” Dictionary.com defines it as “the slaughter of a great number of people, as in battle; butchery; massacre.” In the past year, both sites have kept close tabs on what users searched for during political events. During election season, “glass ceiling,” “trumpery,” “demagogue” and “cavalier” all saw an increase in look-ups. With “carnage,” the connotation of searches on these sites has gone from wary to flat-out bleak. "

ARTS & CULTURE,Trump Reportedly Plans To End National Arts Funding,"Well, having art and culture sure was cool while it lasted! President-elect Donald Trump plans to dramatically slash funding for the humanities when he takes office, according to a new report from The Hill. In meetings with White House staff, Trump transition officials have reportedly indicated that the administration will shutter the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities, as well as privatize the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The Hill report notes that the floated budget cuts “hew closely to a blueprint published last year by the conservative Heritage Foundation.” It’s previously been reported that the think tank has been enormously influential in shaping Trump’s nascent administration. In the “Blueprint for Balance: A Federal Budget for 2017,” the Foundation devotes one page each to the eliminations of the NEA and the NEH, which is more than enough to paint a chilling picture for supporters of public arts funding. In its argument for closing the NEH, the Heritage blueprint proclaims, “government should not use its coercive power of taxation to compel taxpayers to support cultural organizations and activities.” On a similar note, it states of the NEA, “Taxpayer assistance of the arts is neither necessary nor prudent [...] Taxpayers should not be forced to pay for plays, paintings, pageants, and scholarly journals, regardless of the works’ attraction or merit.” Reached via email, both the NEA and the NEH declined to comment specifically on the report. “We’re not speculating on what policies the president-elect (or the Congress) may or may not choose to pursue,” Victoria Hutter, assistant director of public affairs at the NEA, told HuffPost. “We are not going to speculate on the policies or priorities of the new Administration,” NEH spokeswoman Theola DeBose reiterated. The act forming the NEA and the NEH was signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965, in response to a movement to restore due attention and emphasis to the arts in an age driven by scientific innovation and exploration ― an imbalance that hasn’t gone away, as universities today focus on STEM and slash humanities funding. Though the Heritage Foundation blueprint argues that the endowments can and should be replaced by philanthropy, the NEA and NEH serve a unique purpose. Relying solely on individual arts giving and spending can leave humanities institutions and creatives at the whims of the super-wealthy ― think Trump’s foundation purchasing a portrait of the man himself for thousands of dollars, or, more typically, a moneyed New Yorker donating millions to her favorite opera house ― but the NEA and NEH take on initiatives in partnership with state and local organizations to shore up arts and humanities access in underserved communities. Government grants are offered to cultural institutions and individuals who submit outstanding proposals that hold up to objective vetting and review. The NEH has supported the creation of 16 Pulitzer Prize-winning books and Ken Burns’ iconic documentary “The Civil War.” The NEA also helped get the Sundance Film Festival off the ground. In a statement responding to the report, literary human rights organization PEN America denounced the alleged proposed cuts as a sign of a “new Dark Ages,” arguing: “The announcement that this is even under consideration casts a sinister cloud over our vibrant national culture.” Of course, shutting down the NEA and NEH isn’t as simple as a presidential decree issued on Jan. 21. As writer Celeste Pewter pointed out in an extensive Twitter thread, any proposed cuts to various government agencies would depend on Congressional budgets and appropriation: 2) DT can't just wave his arms and go: Ok, this is our budget for the next four year! Bam! Key point from the story. pic.twitter.com/bo5dh0qZRs Much as floods of phone calls from constituents resulted in GOP lawmakers backing down from a secretive push to gut the Office of Congressional Ethics earlier this month, voters opposed to the drastic cuts reported by The Hill can make supporting those budgetary changes deeply uncomfortable for their representatives. For those worried about a possible impending “Dark Ages” of the humanities, repeatedly calling congressional representatives to vocally oppose shuttering the NEA and NEH is a clear and practical next step: It could help save them.  Given Trump’s previously documented lack of interest in books and art that aren’t about himself ― as well as the Heritage Foundation’s power in his transition ― this latest report shouldn’t come as too much of a shock. But the drastic nature of the proposed cuts is nonetheless unsettling, and on the eve of the inauguration, offers a grim vision of what art and culture could face in Trump’s America if the people don’t fight hard to protect them."
ARTS & CULTURE,'War On Women' Protest Signs Don’t Sugarcoat Gender Inequality,"In an effort to organize counter-programming during President-elect Donald Trump’s inaugural festivities, a bevy of bands big and small will perform protest concerts benefiting organizations such as Planned Parenthood this weekend. One such group, a self-described “feminist hardcore punk band” aptly called War on Women, will perform an acoustic show Sunday in Washington, D.C. Their lyrics ― bluntly worded, logically argued dismissals of the patriarchy ― also apparently make for great protest posters. At least, that’s what artist Hexelot has showed us with her latest project, which turns the messages delivered by one of her favorite bands into visual rallying cries. “I just really wanted to celebrate all women,” Hexelot told The Huffington Post in an email. “Whether that be women of color, women not born biologically female, women that practice religion outside Christianity. All women.” The artist chose lyrics that she thought “really focused on the angst and frustration one can feel as a woman” but that were “still hopeful about the future.” “I don’t want to flatter myself by saying I’m making their lyrics more powerful,” she said. “I think I just emphasized their original message by showing who this message is for.” Lyrics like “Give! Us! The! Pill!” and “We are not weak, we are brave” are graced with girlish flourishes like hearts and exclamation marks in the works “because it made the drawings look a little gooey and traditionally (as much as I hate this word) ‘girly,’” Hexelot said, adding that she hoped to flip “the preferred image of women looking and acting a certain way.” “I hear a lot of groups make songs nowadays that talk about equal rights, which is great, but the songs are always so calm,” Hexelot said. Calm is not her speed. She’s concerned that there is no space to discuss and validate “true anger” of gender inequality, lest the women expressing it be labeled “feminazis” or otherwise not taken seriously. “My overall hope for what people take away from my drawings and the music is that they don’t need to remain silent,” she added. A timely message heading into the forthcoming march."
ARTS & CULTURE,Donald Trump Clearly 'Likes Reading Books' If They're About Him,"Donald Trump’s had a tumultuous relationship with books. There are the dozens he’s written ― the one that tells you how to “think like a billionaire,” the one that’s very misogynistic, another on simply “how to get rich.” But when the president-elect/real estate mogul isn’t writing books, what is he reading?  In an interview published today on Axios, co-founders Mike Allen and Jim Vandehei asked Trump that very question. In what is easily the most Brick-in-real-life situation possible, Trump started pointing at random books, saying, “I like that.” You can read the whole exchange in this tweet: Q: What books are you reading?A: Look over there. There are some books. pic.twitter.com/9cItkOPMQ7 The book he’s referencing in that exchange is Unprecedented: The Election That Changed Everything by Thomas Lake ― a book being published by CNN Politics.  Clearly @realDonaldTrump has good taste in books - two (!) copies of @CNN + @CNNPolitics 'Unprecedented' in office https://t.co/yoGAsr7lyL pic.twitter.com/ICNvaDeABF This is absurd for several reasons. For one, Trump has openly referred to CNN as “fake news” in just the past few weeks. Secondly, this book is about him. It is the most Trumpian thing ever for him to say that the book he’s reading is one about himself. We’re just surprised he didn’t recommend his book The Art of the Deal, which he seems to recommend to everyone on Twitter.  Oh man. We’re all screwed, aren’t we? "
ARTS & CULTURE,John Lewis’ Book Will Be Donated To Schools In Need,"Last week, Donald Trump tweeted spurious claims about Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), writing that the activist, who’s been repeatedly arrested for protesting, was “All talk, talk, talk ― no action or results.” “Sad!” the president-elect continued.  If you’re interested in reading about Lewis’ past accomplishments, there’s plenty of available material. But he also continues to spread his message today, via both words and action. Last year, March: Book Three, a graphic novel co-written by Lewis, was awarded the National Book Award for Young People’s Literature, a feat that he responded to with a speech about being turned away by a public library when he was 16, only to continue his quest to educate himself. Since Trump’s accusations, sales of Lewis’ book have gone up, earning it several of the bestselling slots on Amazon. If that’s not evidence enough of tangible influence, maybe this is: Today, March: Book Three received another award, one that will put the graphic novel in the hands of young readers. Ron Charles reported for The Washington Post that the book was given the Walter Dean Myers Award for Outstanding Children’s Literature, awarded by We Need Diverse Books. As a result, 2,000 copies will be donated to “U.S. schools with limited budgets.” Lewis told Charles: “It is my hope that [the award] will inspire more people to read and to use their pen to inspire another generation to speak up and speak out.” Talk, action, results: Lewis gracefully demonstrates how the three can be interwoven."
ARTS & CULTURE,Bookstore Will Hand Out Free Copies Of 'We Should All Be Feminists' On Inauguration Day,"On the occasion of President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration, an Oregon bookstore is celebrating “new beginnings and new challenges” the best way it knows how: by giving away free copies of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s We Should All Be Feminists. Broadway Books, a Portland, Oregon-based bookstore, announced in its January newsletter that it will distribute copies of the 2014 book/essay on Jan. 20 ― one per customer, while supplies last. Why? Because the owners of the store want to “kick off the new year by celebrating the power of women to do great things.” “As the owners of a bookstore founded by women, and still women-owned after almost 25 years, we appreciate strong women, and we rejoice in the men who respectfully support and stand alongside them,” they wrote in the newsletter. Adding: We chose Inauguration Day for this giveaway because when we inaugurate a new president and bring in a new administration it’s a time of new beginnings and new challenges, a chance to reflect on where we are as a country, where we want to go, and how we want to get there. We found the words of this international voice to be particularly inspiring and wanted to share them with our customers. We encourage you to come early to get a copy! We Should All Be Feminists is based on a popular TEDx talk Adichie gave in 2012. “Some people ask: ‘Why the word feminist? Why not just say you are a believer in human rights, or something like that?’” the Nigerian author writes in the essay. “Because that would be [...] a way of pretending that it was not women who have, for centuries, been excluded. It would be a way of denying that the problem of gender targets women.” The work is so influential that a Women’s Lobby wanted to give every 16-year-old in Sweden a copy and Beyoncé sampled the TEDx talk on “Flawless.” In case you haven't read it: @bookbroads is giving away free copies of @AdichieSpeaks ""We Should All Be Feminists"" on inauguration day Oregonian reporter Casey Parks alerted us to Broadway Books’ plans on Twitter. Kim Bissell, co-owner of Broadway Books, added her own take on the decision in the newsletter: “We believe that all our voices matter and hope to inspire our children to reach for their goals based on their desires and abilities and not their gender.”"
ARTS & CULTURE,Marvel’s New She-Hulk Reminds Us That Anger Can Serve A Purpose,"In 1980, Marvel introduced a new character to its canon that deviated from its norm. Neither a brawny male hero nor a tiny, big-haired female damsel, She-Hulk was brought in as the cousin of Bruce Banner, gaining his anger-filled transformative powers after a blood transfusion. She-Hulk’s character is a criminal defense lawyer who’s smart, savvy and levelheaded ― except when she’s not. Bursts of anger turn her into a bulkier, greener version of herself, which she chooses to inhabit permanently in one Marvel storyline. She-Hulk, née Jennifer Walters, eventually becomes part of the Avengers and, in a 2008 comic, forms a group of women fighters called the Lady Liberators that includes Storm and Spider-Woman. In “Hulk #1,” an installment of Walters’ story released by Marvel at the end of last year, She-Hulk becomes a better-rounded character. She’s taken the place of her cousin, Bruce, who’d recently died in Civil War II ― a major event in the series. Barely surviving herself, she spends much of the issue coping with post-traumatic stress, reconciling her roiling inner feelings with the work she must focus herself to accomplish. “I think it’s a great topic for a superhero story, because every heroic event has a next day and consequences,” “Hulk #1” writer Mariko Tamaki told The Huffington Post, adding, “I think these consequences dig into the human element of being superhuman.”  Reflecting on the human element of comic book characters is something Tamaki is comfortable doing. Her graphic novels Skim and This One Summer both feature heroines who grapple with young adulthood, body image and general feelings of isolation. The latter is regularly challenged in schools for its incorporation of adult themes in a book for young readers. “In the big picture, the experiences of women, the social issues relating to women, are important to me. When I write, I try not to reinforce stereotypes about how a woman should be ― in terms of size, in terms of appearance, in terms of what is ‘appropriate’ and so on,” Tamaki said. “I want the characters I write to feel ‘real’ and I want them to mirror the diversity of experiences that make up being a woman in the modern Western world.” So, her Jennifer Walters isn’t just a one-dimensional “She-Hulk” expected to be always simultaneously strong and appealing. Instead, she’s both, in turns, and she’s dealing with issues unrelated to her gender: trauma and the death of her cousin, an injustice that spurs, yes, more anger. Asked whether she wanted to confront the stereotype that woman expressing their anger are villainous in her work, Tamaki said simply, “I think anger, fear and pain are interesting things to write about. They are a key element of stories about the human experience. What’s a good story without a little rage?” Read an excerpt of “Hulk #1” below: Find the comic on Amazon or at your local bookstore."
ARTS & CULTURE,Taran Killam's 'Hamilton' Look Is Giving Us Major Jebidiah Atkinson Vibes,"Taran Killam has moved well beyond 30 Rock to the Richard Rogers Theatre. The longtime “SNL” star, who was ousted from the late-night sketch show in August 2016, will take on the role of King George III in Broadway’s “Hamilton” starting Jan. 17.

ARTS & CULTURE,'Nasty Women' Is The Intersectional Essay Collection Feminists Need,"What do we talk about when we talk about women’s rights? For some women, affordable contraception is the most personally affecting issue; for others, the fear of deportation is more urgent. Our needs aren’t homogenous. We do make up over half of the world’s population, after all. With the fast-approaching Women’s March on Washington, the question of how activists can give each of these rights credence under a single banner is timelier than ever. Organizers succinctly outlined their mission this weekend, prioritizing intersectionality. “Women’s rights are human rights, regardless of a woman’s race, ethnicity, religion, immigration status, sexual identity, gender expression, economic status, age or disability,” the march site reads. A similar credo is supported by an adjacent project, raising funds on Kickstarter for the next two weeks. 404 Ink, an indie publisher based in the U.K., plans to release an essay collection in March called Nasty Women, featuring a chorus of women’s voices and covering topics ranging from immigration to sexual assault. “2017 is the year to push back against post-truths and sensationalism,” a YouTube video promoting the book begins. “Here is a book of real stories with real voices in it.” In an interview with The Huffington Post, co-editor Heather McDaid said, “We don’t believe there’s a point in publishing a collection of real experiences if they’re an echo-chamber of the same story.”  So, the day after Trump won the election, she and her collaborator, Laura Jones, decided to begin reaching out to writers who might want to participate in their project, allowing them to choose the topics of their own essays. “There was a sense of shock to many, anger and sadness to others, particularly as women having watched someone sail to the presidency on such misogynistic rhetoric,” McDaid said. “With downplaying experts, and post-truth replacing reality, we wanted to do our part in pushing back with real stories and shouting about women’s experiences as loudly as possible while others try to sweep them, and many others’ stories, under the carpet.” She described the resulting essays as being about, “everything from being a proud daughter of immigrants, to surviving sexual assault, the fetishization black women face, to more personal tales of family, mental health and role models, and hobbies that instill a sense of power.” So far, the project’s been successful, gaining support from The Handmaid’s Tale author Margaret Atwood, YA author Louise O’Neill, and author and TV writer Nikesh Shukla. And, McDaid and Jones have surpassed their fundraising goals, confirming that there’s an appetite for real stories told by real women."
ARTS & CULTURE,Fake Inaugural Poem Is A Puzzling Ode To Trump’s ‘Purpose And Strength’,"Donald Trump is having a tough time securing performers for his inauguration. Earlier this week, the Bruce Springsteen cover band slated to play an inauguration gala nixed its plans; before that, Broadway singer Jennifer Holliday withdrew her initial commitment to perform the night before, issuing an apology to frustrated fans. If celebrities are boycotting the event, will the president-elect risk the same rejection by trying to secure an inaugural poet? Professional authors have been among the most vocal decriers of Trump, beginning with a strongly worded open letter to voters last spring. But today, The Independent reported ― in a post initially headlined, “Donald Trump inauguration poem calls Barack Obama a ‘tyrant’” ― that a poem has been decided on, written specifically for the event by Joseph Charles MacKenzie, an American poet whose website looks confusingly like a fundraising page, requesting donations on several separate tabs.  “Like receiving discounts on MacKenziePoet products?,” the site’s contact page reads. “Enjoy seeing how your support helps grow my lyric verses? Maybe you just want to stay in touch with a fellow traveler in the kingdom of truth and beauty.” Twitter caught on, percolating the news, which, it turns out, was untrue. MacKenzie’s poem — written to celebrate Trump’s Scottish roots, and including the line, “With purpose and strength he came down from his tower/ To snatch from a tyrant his ill-gotten power” ― is not a confirmed inaugural reading. Earlier today, the Society of Classical Poets, the small literary organization that initially published the poem, posted on Facebook that Trump’s team “should” have it read at the inauguration. The post points out that Trump would be the first Republican president to have an inaugural poet. Indeed, only John F. Kennedy, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama have featured poetry readings at their respective inaugurations, a tradition that wasn’t established until 1961. Why the Society of Classical Poets, an organization that’s at least established enough to have a contest advertised on Poets & Writers, would tout a clumsily arranged work by a writer whose chief concern seems to be personal promotion befuddled writers on Twitter. But for now, MacKenzie’s “Pibroch of the Domhnall” remains nothing more than a puzzling ode.  In lieu of reading it, take a look at a list of poems we compiled after the election."
ARTS & CULTURE,Shelter Dogs Get Swimming Lessons In Adorably Fetching Photos,"How could photos of cute dogs swimming get any better? When they’re shelter dogs learning pool safety, duh. Photographer and animal advocate Seth Casteel released a new set of photos this week from from a January swimming lesson he held with dogs up for adoption at animal rescue group spcaLA. TV network Z Living took their own photos of the lesson to promote Casteel’s new show, “Finding Fido,”  which focuses on “matchmaking” people with adoptable dogs. Though Casteel does swim with dogs on the show, this particular lesson isn’t featured in the series. Casteel, who has been photographing pets since around 2007, rocketed to fame in 2012, when his captivating shots of dogs swimming underwater went viral online. Through taking photos of dogs in the water, Casteel came to realize that though most dogs instinctively know how to “doggie paddle” when they get in the water, many canines still need some instruction in water safety. In particular, dogs can be confused by swimming pools, since they’re more difficult to exit than say, a lake. “The dog has to understand that it’s not a natural body of water,” Casteel told The Huffington Post. “They see a pool and they don’t get it … they can’t just swim to the side and get out. They have to find the exit.” Casteel also works with dogs who may not be used to swimming to get them more comfortable with the water. “I love to see when a dog makes that transition, from ‘What’s going on?’ to, ‘Hey, we’re having fun,’” he said. At his lesson for spcaLA, he also enlisted the help of Ricochet, an acclaimed surfing therapy dog. Ricochet’s calm and confident nature made her the perfect “role model” for dogs who might have felt a bit bewildered by the water at first, Casteel said. Three of the dogs who participated in the spcaLA swim lesson have already been adopted, but three of them — Cloud, Salem and Harrod — are still looking for homes. You can find more information about those dogs and spcaLA here. NOTE: This post was updated to reflect the fact that this particular swimming lesson does not appear in “Finding Fido.”"
ARTS & CULTURE,Library Book Finally Returned 100 Years Later In San Francisco,"A book checked out from a San Francisco library 100 years ago was returned last week, outliving the library branch it was checked out from in the first place. The San Francisco Chronicle reported that Webb Johnson returned a copy of the short story collection Forty Minutes Late that had been checked out by his great-grandmother Phoebe in 1917. Book turned in 100 YEARS late to @SFPublicLibrary. (This makes us feel better about our OWN overdues!) https://t.co/5hXNdaSzlP She checked out the book from the library’s Fillmore branch, which has since shut down, and she died one week before it was due.  The book was returned during the library’s amnesty program, San Francisco’s local ABC news station reported. The program, offered in the beginning of the year, allows library-goers to return overdue books without paying a fine. Little did the library know there was a book on its way back that technically carried a fine of more than $3,500.  Even so, the library usually caps overdue fees at $5, according to the Chronicle. This isn’t the first century-old library tome to be returned. Last month, the granddaughter of a man who attended Hereford Cathedral School in Hereford, England, returned a book her grandfather borrowed from the school library sometime between 1886 and 1894."
ARTS & CULTURE,"'Nasty Women' Art Shows Raise Over $50,000 For Planned Parenthood","Nearly 700 “Nasty Women” artists teamed up to protest President-elect Donald Trump earlier this month, contributing to an exhibition responding to his infamous debate barb. The show, co-organized by New York-based artist /www.roxannejackson.com/""}}"">Roxanne Jackson, featured “nasty”-related works priced at $100 or less ― all of which were sold to benefit Planned Parenthood. The pieces were on view from Jan. 12 through Jan. 15, at Queens’ Knockdown Center, and, over the course of three days, sold out, raising $42,500, according to Jackson.  The NYC version of “Nasty Women” is but one of several shows planned in various cities across the country. As Jackson explained in an email to The Huffington Post, a “Nasty” show in Phoenix, Arizona, that opened on Jan. 14 sold out of over 200 works in the opening night alone, raising $11,000 for Planned Parenthood. In total, the “Nasty” organizers have raised over $50,000 for the nonprofit organization devoted to reproductive health services ― and counting. The significant contribution is timely. Trump has expressed a desire to defund Planned Parenthood and “punish” women for having abortions. Jackson originally posted a callout for a “Nasty Women” group show on Nov. 14, 2016. “Hello female artists/curators! Let’s organize a NASTY WOMEN group show!!! Who’s interested???” she wrote, tagging women artists, curators and writers in her circle.  Soon after posting, the message went viral as artist after artist responded to and passed on the message. “I had no idea how much this would escalate and evolve,” Jackson explained to HuffPost in a previous interview. Within the first hour of posting, she had 300 responses. Jackson’s team accepted every work offered after that and, as a result, they acquired approximately 1,000 pieces by the time submissions closed.  “This show isn’t necessarily about highlighting individual artists,” Jackson explained. “It’s about female-identifying artists coming together against the Trump regime.”  There are currently almost 30 “Nasty Happenings” scheduled for the next two months, located mostly in American cities with a few shows set abroad. On the official “Nasty Women” website, Jackson and her team invite artists interested in organizing their own “Nasty Women” show to add their own dates, providing instructions with only one caveat: all shows adopting the “Nasty” name must donate their proceeds to an organization benefiting women’s rights.   UPDATE: Tara Plath from the Knockdown Center told HuffPost that an additional $8,000 raised via tickets sales to “Nasty Women” evening performances will be donated to four organizations: Girls for Gender Equity, SisterSong, the New York Immigration Coalition, and Callen-Lorde Community Health Center."
ARTS & CULTURE,"Obama, Possible Aspiring-Novelist-In-Chief, Once Wrote Short Fiction","President Barack Obama’s bookishness is the worst-kept, most endearing non-secret in Washington, D.C. As we, and many other outlets, have previously written, he has long been a voracious reader of everything from contemporary literary fiction to classic writings by American statesmen. His collegiate stabs at poetry were well-circulated during his first presidential run, and his two books of nonfiction have been bestsellers. But fiction? In a thoughtful new interview with The New York Times’ book critic Michiko Kakutani, Obama discussed the short stories he wrote as a young man, giving rare insight into his artistic side. As a community organizer recently out of college, he told Kakutani, he wanted to hold onto his love for writing and storytelling despite his choice of a policy-driven career path. Like many aspiring writers, he said, “I would come home from work, and I would write in my journal or write a story or two.” This isn’t a brand-new revelation; rumblings of Obama’s past life as a story writer have surfaced before. In 2012, writer Michael Lewis profiled the president for Vanity Fair and later told CNN that the two discussed Obama’s youthful forays into the world of fiction. “He tried to submit short stories to literary magazines, and they’re very literary short stories,” Lewis said. In Kakutani’s interview, we get some fascinating details about Obama’s work. Writing short fiction, he told The New York Times, allowed him to sort through the sometimes disparate strands of his identity and arrive at a healthy sense of self: For me, particularly at that time, writing was the way I sorted through a lot of crosscurrents in my life — race, class, family. And I genuinely believe that it was part of the way in which I was able to integrate all these pieces of myself into something relatively whole. People now remark on this notion of me being very cool, or composed. And what is true is that I generally have a pretty good sense of place and who I am, and what’s important to me. And I trace a lot of that back to that process of writing. What kind of fiction would a young Barack Obama write? Apparently exactly the kind you’d expect: It’s interesting, when I read them, a lot of them had to do with older people. I think part of the reason was because I was working in communities with people who were significantly older than me. We were going into churches, and probably the average age of these folks was 55, 60. A lot of them had scratched and clawed their way into the middle class, but just barely. They were seeing the communities in which they had invested their hopes and dreams and raised their kids starting to decay — steel mills had closed, and there had been a lot of racial turnover in these communities. And so there was also this sense of loss and disappointment. [...] So when I think back on what’s interesting to me, there is not a lot of Jack Kerouac, open-road, young kid on the make discovering stuff. It’s more melancholy and reflective. Melancholy and reflective? Sounds an awful lot like a certain speech he recently addressed to the nation. He even revealed some tantalizing details about specific stories he wrote, which we’re now dying to read: One story is about an old black pastor who seems to be about to lose his church, his lease is running out and he’s got this loyal woman deacon who is trying to buck him up. Another is about an elderly couple — a white couple in L.A., — and he’s like in advertising, wrote jingles. And he’s just retired and has gotten cranky. And his wife is trying to convince him that his life is not over. We may never read these short stories, but let’s remember a few key facts:  1. Obama has said he plans to write a book after leaving office. 2. Which is happening in a matter of days. 3. After leaving the presidency, George W. Bush graced our eyeballs with the fruits of a foray into painting that pleasantly shocked the nation. 4. Anything is possible. For more on Pres. Obama’s short fiction and other literary insights, read the full New York Times interview here."
ARTS & CULTURE,'Hope' Artist Shepard Fairey Made Some Commanding Poster Art For The March On D.C.,"Over eight years ago, street artist Shepard Fairey created a graphic portrait of then-presidential-candidate Barack Obama, an image that promptly became ingrained in the minds of most American citizens. The image’s sole written word, “Hope,” embodied the ethos of the time, the overwhelming conviction that our nation’s government could provide for all its citizens, regardless of race, gender or socioeconomic status.  Now, on the brink of the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, we are living in a very different America, one in which many of the tenets on which this nation was founded ― freedom of expression, freedom of religion, equal justice for all ― are seemingly under threat. To address this surreal moment in American history, Fairey is once again turning to the power of art. Though instead of hope, the artist is advocating for resistance. Fairey is collaborating with muralist Jessica Sabogal and political artist Ernesto Yerena on an activist art project entitled “We the People,” which will flood the public consciousness come inauguration day. The project, commissioned by The Amplifier Foundation, aims to visualize the non-partisan principles that always characterized the true spirit of America ― diversity, democracy and shared humanity.   Fairey, Yerena, and Sabogal teamed up to create the series of posters, which can be used by protesters marching in Washington on Jan. 21. Citing the possibility of “restrictions on signs and banners” in some parts of the district during inauguration weekend, however, We the People decided to get creative. To sidestep restrictions and ensure that the images could be distributed in such a short amount of time, they turned to an old media staple: newspapers. The grassroots campaign is currently raising funds on Kickstarter to take out full-page advertisements in the Washington Post on Jan. 20, each featuring a work of protest art that can, conveniently, be ripped out and taken to the streets. With days to go, the campaign has far exceeded the $60,000 goal meant to pay for six ads ― We the People has almost reached $1 million worth of donations. Come inauguration weekend, the Amplifier Foundation will also circulate some posters at D.C. metro stops, “from the back of moving vans,” and at drop spots that have yet to be announced. As usual, all of Amplifier’s images will be available for free download ahead of time.  Those interested in supporting the project can still head to Kickstarter to help bring art to the streets of Washington on a day when all of America will be watching. The campaign closes on Wednesday, Jan. 18, at 7:00 p.m. ET. Following the inauguration, We the People intends to send the five images to the new president as postcards, PBS reports. As we approach the beginning of Trump’s presidency, artists across the country have felt empowered to rise up and resist the normalization of racism, sexism and hate. In the words of Fairey himself: “I think art can help to wake people up because when an image resonates emotionally we want to get to the bottom of it, and art really helps to make people feel things that then they talk about.”  The Amplifier Foundation also created a call out for poster art from women-identifying and non-binary people across the country, to be used at the Women’s March on Washington. You can download and print five out of the eight selected posters for free on the website. "
ARTS & CULTURE,I Asked Artists About Empathy: Here Is What They Said...,"“It is my duty to voice the sufferings of people, the sufferings that never end and are as big as mountains.” ― Käthe Kollwitz The great German artist, printmaker and sculptor Käthe Kolwitz (1867-1945) knew profound personal suffering. After her younger son Peter died in battle in Flanders in October, 1914 she fell into a deep depression that re-shaped both her art and political views. The double sculpture that she finally completed in 1931 for the cemetery in which he son was buried, shows the artist and her husband apparently kneeling in grief. However, when asked about the theme of the sculpture Kollwitz explained that it was about much more than grief: it also represents all parents of her generation, asking forgiveness for having led their sons into war. The Grieving Parents, like so many of Kollwitz’ finest works, is grounded in empathy: the ability to understand and share the feelings of another. She recognized that she was expressing something greater than her own feelings and that her art could only function if it served an entire society. Grief and loss are universal feelings that bind us, and sharing them with others leads to consolation and social transformation. It is not surprising that in 1936 the Nazi party barred Kollwitz from displaying her work which they branded as “degenerate.” Deep feelings for the sufferings and losses of others—which lead to collective introspection—can lead to resistance against authoritarian politicians and those who advocate war and other forms of sacrifice and suffering. It is interesting to note that the idea of empathy is a late-nineteenth/early twentieth century development, that derives from the imaginative act of projecting oneself into a work of art. In her book You Must Change Your Life: The Story of Rainer Maria Rilke and Auguste Rodin, author Rachel Corbett writes: The invention of empathy corresponds to many of the climactic shifts in the art, philosophy and psychology of fin-de-siècle Europe, and it changed the way artists thought about their work and the way observers related to it for generations to come. The development of empathy as a social expectation and custom parallels the development of Expressionism: of inwardness as a gateway to emotional connection. That inwardness—so essential in the modern conception of a self-aware individual—is the hinge that connects to social awareness and the empathetic understanding of others. Empathy is, without doubt, a political force that plays a considerable role in attitudes towards social issues. In a recent article for Psychology Today—Beware America’s Shocking Loss of Empathy—attorney and social advocate David Noise argues that empathy and it’s “cousin” compassion are crucial elements in politics and policy, arguing that they “lead to an intelligent assessment of what is happening internally and around the world, a minimal level of humane values, and rational attempts to apply those values.” In the context of America’s recent Presidential election, where outrage, uncivil discourse and personal attacks demonstrated a shocking lack of empathy, it seems critical for artists to ask themselves about the role of empathy in their own work. Whether their work is political, personal or somewhere in-between, the element of empathy can allow an artist to “give voice to the sufferings of others,” as Käthe Kolwitz did so nobly in her works. Below is a selection of responses posted on my personal Facebook page after I asked the question: What is the role of empathy in your art?  Note: some responses have been edited for brevity. Steven Holmes: Making art assumes empathy. Making art is an act of sharing. It is by definition, an invitation to others to leave their isolation and meet others on the same road as you. An artist without empathy is a sociopath. Mark David Lloyd: Empathy can be painful. Much of my artwork on a conceptual level deals with suffering in one form of another, empathy is experienced in the making process of the artworks and sometimes by the viewer. When we witness suffering and distress in others, our natural tendency to empathize can bring us vicarious pain. Colin Darke: It plays the central role. I only paint or draw in hopes of having a shared experience ― my picture echoing the viewer’s feelings (past or present, happiness/sadness/wonderment) in a new and powerful way. Julia Morgan Scott: I have become somewhat suspicious of efforts to consciously insert empathy into painting. It seems IMHO to politicize something natural to the process of simply painting what one truly loves. Isaias Sandoval-Streufert: For me empathy is essential, without empathy it will be only apathy, my work is about passion, I can’t paint apathy even if I try. Karen Kaapcke: I also have the thought that it is possible that people with high levels of empathy take to the arts as vehicles for that way of being, because it is possibly not an easy way of being (I am thinking of myself when quite young, being almost unbearably disturbed by seeing certain things, or being almost unbearably moved by the beauty of something. Both are equally empathic. A life in the arts might make being that way a little more bearable). Nancy Good: Empathy is key as it speaks the language of connection, i.e. connection to the life experiences of the viewer. We are all connected in pain, joy, fear, wonder, hunger, yearning ... all we experience. Empathy in art banishes isolation and invites healing. Franck De Las Mercedes: Most of my work stems from an emotionally charged, at times dark, at times painful place. To hear others regard it as beautiful or meaningful to their lives is the biggest compliment. The gift is in sharing and understanding the feelings and experiences of another. F. Scott Hess: Empathy is the link that a painter of figures relies on to make others feel the work. It happens before conscious thought, before critical analysis kicks in. You grab your audience by their empathetic guts before they know what’s happening. Gesture, facial expression, movement, composition, and paint application all work together to achieve this end. Judith Peck: In order to create, I have to feel very deeply, without that connection I believe my work would be a hollow shell. Steph Rocknak: From an article I wrote a few years ago: “Psychology, which in many respects grew out of Hume’s work, is helping us to further clarify the fundamental role that empathy plays in our moral sensibilities. Hume’s work, written over two hundred and fifty years ago, is still profoundly relevant. But great artists have always seemed to know what Hume knew; they hook us up to the empathy machine when we become too self-involved, too isolated. For the most part, artists, not philosophers, keep us human; they can put us—no, sometimes force us—into the other person’s shoes. We see what it is like to be a victim a war, we see what it is like to be terribly conflicted, we see what it was like to be trapped inside the World Trade Center on 9/11. Artists can also expose our horror for what it is; we get a look inside the heads of those who know no empathy: the psychopaths, the sociopaths, the narcissists. Sometimes, we even get to see what it is like to live in an entire society that has gone the way of a psychopath. Once again, Bosch and Michelangelo come to mind, or, more recently, Cormac McCarthy’s novel, The Road. “ Dab Zabooty: Without empathy art becomes a technical exercise. Tristan Xavier Köster: In German there is this word “Sympathie” (not to be confused with sympathy) which basically means that you can understand and empathize with somebody(always used positively). I think that this sensation of Sympathie, finds itself in nearly all forms of art, allowing complete strangers to feel and see/hear with the artist. ‪Empathy (veiled by a sense of guilt) fuels just about every single melody I write, but I always try and make sure that my music is “sympathisch” to the listener. Joseph Bravo: Genuine aesthetic communication rests on empathy between the artist and the viewer. If art is to maintain some intrinsic cultural relevance then the audience indeed needs to be broadened. With that broadening of the audience must also come a broadening of the messages and the identity of the messengers as well, even at the risk of a disquieting cacophony. But ideally, each artist would be endeavoring to expand that empathic communication to edify as wide a range of humanity as possible. If artists are to speak with their audience rather that merely at it, then they should seek to find at least a point of common ground on which to plant that seed of empathy. Conor Walton: Empathy assumes reciprocal emotional relations between artist, subject and viewer that are egalitarian insofar as each can identify with the other, and this might naturally be expected to form the basis of an egalitarian art. It might suit a modern style of portraiture or figure painting which takes human equality for granted, but most of the great artworks of the past were produced in a different social context, and embody power relations and notions of social hierarchy that obstruct empathic relations. Are they to be admired less as a consequence? Is a contemporary work that expresses empathy superior to an ancient masterpiece that doesn’t? Or might it be the reverse: that cultivating empathy leads towards an urbane, popular, sentimental art, but places the highest summits of achievement off limits because of its antipathy to the sublime? Vonn Sumner: Empathy is the most important, most essential, most foundational element of painting and drawing. Empathy was the guiding principle of Wayne Thiebaud’s teaching, and he would often state it plainly. He would also say that empathy is the basis of civilization and quote Gloria Steinham: “Empathy is the most radical human emotion.” Joao de Brito: A Portuguese Proverb:”O artista é a voz do povo” or “ artists are the voice of the people” empathy is what is channeled by many artists to express what needs to seen or heard from the public when the world is in confusion. Ingrid Reeve: My art is not about progress; it’s about truth. Empathy is essential for discerning truth. Note: The original Facebook post and all replies can be viewed at this link. "
ARTS & CULTURE,Artist Turns Donald Trump’s Most Controversial Quotes Into Comic Book Covers,"An artist is giving President-elect Donald Trump’s most outrageous comments the comic book treatment. Cartoonist Robert Sikoryak is transforming several of the controversial and offensive statements that Trump made during the presidential election campaign into eye-catching and thought-provoking illustrations. “The idea occurred to me right before the election,” the New York City-based artist told The Huffington Post on Saturday.  “Trump had said so many outrageous things during his campaign that I wanted to catalogue them.” “It was important to me to only use Trump’s actual quotes, I didn’t want to put any words in his mouth,” he added. “Once Trump became the president-elect, I felt I had to do it.” Sikoryak’s work has previously appeared on the cover pages of The New Yorker magazine and the Harvard Business Review. He has also transformed Apple’s iTunes terms of service into comic parodies. For this project, titled “The Unquotable Trump,” he has compiled the images into a mini-comic. He’s also posting them on a dedicated Tumblr page. “The reaction has been very enthusiastic, much more so than I expected,” Sikoryak told HuffPost. “I needed to get these comics out of my system, so it’s gratifying that other people have been enjoying them.” Check out more of his Trump-themed comic book covers below and see his other work via his website, Facebook, Tumblr and Twitter accounts."
ARTS & CULTURE,Student Transforms College Rejection Letter Into Viral Work Of Art,"This student just transformed a negative into a positive in the most beautiful way. When Claudia Vulliamy found out that the prestigious Oxford University in England had turned her down for a place on its classics course Wednesday, she was understandably disappointed. But she didn’t get downhearted. Instead, the 18-year-old student at Camden School for Girls in London hacked up the letter of rejection and worked it into a painting. Yesterday, my daughter learned that she hadn't got into Oxford. By the time I got in from work, she'd made this from her rejection letter pic.twitter.com/KCInrTA1OO Her mom, Louisa Saunders, posted the above photograph of her creation on Twitter, and the image is now going viral. “When I got home to see the painting, I laughed, because it was funny and also sassy,” Saunders told The Huffington Post on Saturday. “It was nice, because I could see that she wasn’t feeling too sad about the rejection. I know it breaks some people’s hearts,” she added. “I really admired her spirit, but I wasn’t very surprised because it’s fairly typical of her ― she’s always been creative.” Saunders’ Twitter feed was soon flooded with positive comments about her daughter’s inspired work of art: @louisa_saunders @AMCELL Oxford missed their chance with your daughter. Bigger and better things coming. @louisa_saunders She doesn't need a place at Oxford, she needs her own gallery exhibition. @louisa_saunders She's amazing and will go far. She is her own woman and that's the most important thing. @louisa_saunders what a brilliant response, good for her. rejection is difficult, but it moves us forwards in other ways. she'll do well. Vuilliamy, meanwhile, told HuffPost she was “really surprised” that her artwork went viral, but she’s “so glad that it has cheered people up.” “Usually social media can be quite brutal but it made my week,” she added to ITV News. “I just thought it was a bit of a bummer not to get in. I felt like making it into something.” She now hopes to study at Durham University ― and continues posting new artwork, such as the piece below depicting her mom, to Instagram:  My mum, in acrylic #art A photo posted by Claudia Vulliamy (@flamboyant_aesthete) on Jan 12, 2017 at 4:03pm PST"
ARTS & CULTURE,How To Survive In A Conspiracy Theorist's World,"When the TBS show “Search Party,” a dark detective sitcom starring Alia Shawkat, dropped in November, I wasn’t paying much attention ― this, despite the fact that I’d been intrigued for months by the unsettling trailers. In the pre- and post-election madness, I’d become a cable news junkie and, alternately, switched off the TV entirely and retreated with stacks of books.  Turns out, this was a mistake. During a month when I was trying to figure out what had happened to my country, how it had become so obsessed with imagined pedophile rings run out of D.C.-area pizza parlors and millions of undocumented immigrants voting in California (didn’t happen), “Search Party” would have been the perfect fictional chaser to all those hours with The Washington Post and New York Times. It’s a show for an age of conspiracy theorists and amateur gumshoes, a jagged-edged sitcom that tries to unravel the psychological roots and painful consequences of our yearning for morbid puzzles. Of course, politics never overtly enters the picture. “Search Party” takes, as its subject, another zeitgeisty genre: amateur detection. Self-effacing Dory (Shawkat), who channels a hipster ‘50s vibe with her subdued curly bob and boxy blouses, lives with her uptight boyfriend, Drew (John Reynolds), in New York. They’re a few years out of college, but Dory is adrift, working as a personal assistant to a wealthy, dysfunctional housewife while occasionally making noises about pursuing a job mentoring underprivileged girls. One day, she spots a missing poster with a familiar face: Chantal Witherbottom, a girl she recognizes from her college dorm, has vanished.  When Dory brings up Chantal’s disappearance at brunch with Drew and friends, they’re dismissive. Chantal, they recall, kind of sucked. Anyway, they doubt she’s really in danger. Dory’s besties Elliott (John Early) and Portia (Meredith Hagner) barely notice her new preoccupation with Chantal’s case as they toggle through social media feeds, where they’re absorbed in the maintenance of their own manicured self-images ― the former, as a gay cancer survivor who’s launching a charity water bottle startup; the latter, as an adorable blond actress starring as a Latina detective on a new procedural.  But Dory can’t let it go. As she pursues apparent leads, shows up uninvited at the Witherbottom family’s vigil for Chantal, gets caught up in a Brooklyn boutique-based cult, and partners up with a dissolutely handsome private detective, Keith (Ron Livingston), her relationships suffer. In her quest to save Chantal ― an unlikely outcome at best ― Dory inflicts irreparable damage on everyone around her, and even on herself.  In the horrifying finale (SPOILER!), she and her now-estranged boyfriend accidentally bludgeon to death Keith, with whom she had an affair but had come to believe was her stalker. Immediately thereafter, Portia arrives on the scene with the missing woman herself, who confesses glibly that she had simply run away and dropped contact with her loved ones after a bad breakup. The show ends there, with Dory in the bloody wreckage of her own botched self-investigation of a non-crime with a non-victim at its center. The only damage that has been caused, in the end, was caused by her own paranoia and recklessness. This narrative undoubtedly skewers the recklessness of the amateur detective trend, both in fiction and in reality (think Redditors regrettably and incorrectly fingering Sunil Tripathi, a missing student, as a suspect in the Boston bombings), but it’s also an indictment of a paranoid, hair-triggered approach to the world that’s hardly restricted to crime-solving forums.  When a presidential candidate promises to jail his opponent on unspecified charges during a debate, or when a man with a gun shows up at a pizza parlor to “self-investigate” rumors of a candidate’s child sex ring, or even when the media is rocked by thinly sourced assertions that the president-elect might have had sex workers in Russia perform a golden shower for him, it seems our political arena has become little more than another theater for conspiracy theorizing and distracting dramatics. How different, really, is the allure of true crime mystery from that of a conspiracy theory? It’s been argued that the crime genre’s allure lies, in part, in its ability to grant a comforting order to the universe ― the hero vs. the villain, the mystery followed by the answer. In a rather crotchety 1944 essay, critic Edmund Wilson suggested that the popularity of the detective story at the time was due to ... “an all-pervasive feeling of guilt and by a fear of impending disaster which it seemed hopeless to try to avert because it never seemed conclusively possible to pin down the responsibility. Who had committed the original crime and who was going to commit the next one? [...] Nobody seems guiltless, nobody seems safe; and then, suddenly, the murderer is spotted, and — relief! — he is not, after all, a person like you or me. He is a villain [...] and he has been caught by an infallible Power, the supercilious and omniscient detective, who knows exactly how to fix the guilt.” Though today’s crime dramas are more often souped up with an amateur element, allowing the reader to put him- or herself in the infallible shoes of the somehow omniscient detective, the psychology still rings true. Dory herself manifests both the guilt and the fear; she’s terrified that she’s just like Chantal, a pending victim who will be instantly forgotten, and she feels driven to place herself on the side of justice, instead, by becoming the lost girl’s savior. Her search party, her ex-boyfriend Julian (Brandon Micheal Hall) points out early on, is not really about Chantal ― it’s about Dory’s own lack of control over her life and her thirst for attention. “I think you’ve decided this matters to you because you have nothing else,” he tells her bluntly. Conspiracy theories play into this same psychological need for control over an unpredictable and frightening cosmos. Many recent conspiracy theories are political; as the country becomes more partisan, the opponents to the party in power tend to respond with conspiracy theories that restore sense to the world as they know it. Donald Trump rose to political popularity through championing the birther conspiracy theory, which held that President Obama could be unseated from office because he was not born in America ― a relatively quick-seeming fix to the Obama presidency, for his most rabid opponents. Trump ultimately, and reluctantly, disavowed birtherism, but he became the conspiracy theory president. During his campaign, he retweeted racially charged fake crime statistics. At rallies, he repeatedly proclaimed, “I alone can fix it.” It’s the sort of self-aggrandizing appropriation of the hero role that makes amateur sleuthing and running for president alike so ego-boosting and comforting: You’re taking control, making sure you’re on the side of good rather than the villain or the victim. This desperate need to feel worthy and necessary might initially seem understandable, and even innocuous ― in certain settings. Dory’s meddling on “Search Party” appears fairly well-intentioned and mild, at least at first. Of course, inserting herself into a stranger’s life, with little understanding of the situation and the effect she might have, is hardly a harmless hobby. The final result of her quest strikingly resembles a scene that actually took place shortly after “Search Party” premiered: the above-mentioned Pizzagate believer’s ill-fated attempt to search the basement of Comet Ping Pong for a pedophile ring run by Hillary Clinton’s associates. That horrifying event, also motivated by a misplaced sense of heroism and resulting in (near) tragedy, shared another notable characteristic with Dory’s quest ― it couldn’t have happened without a staggering surplus of confirmation bias, which, in brief, is the tendency to seek out, notice and interpret information in a way that reinforces one’s existing hypotheses. Pizzagate, like many other debunked yet persistent conspiracies, rests on slender coincidences, oddities and manufactured or distorted evidence that proponents focus on to the exclusion of clear and convincing proof to the contrary. Usually, this is because they already believe involved parties ― in this case, Hillary Clinton and her associates, one of whom owns the pizza parlor in question ― are corrupt and evil. Likewise, many on the left have been troublingly frenzied for details about Trump’s alleged golden shower party, recently reported upon by several outlets, the actual evidence for which looks mighty shaky.  Caught up in her own neuroses and fears, Dory, too, latches on to the smallest scraps of evidence that she’s working on the side of good, easily ignoring or discarding any evidence to the contrary. If given two possible paths, she’ll always pursue the line of inquiry that confirms her original, outlandish theory ― even if, at each turn, her suspicions lead her absurdly awry. She’s still convinced, somehow, that she’s right, that she’s the hero, and that she will be vindicated. Doggedly pursuing an imagined problem might seem to be merely wasted effort, but it can turn into something sinister. When fighting a great evil, extreme measures might appear justified; if that evil is fabricated, distorted or imagined, then the collateral damage from the extreme measures taken to destroy it remains real. Thankfully, the appearance of a gunman at Comet Ping Pong didn’t result in any casualties, but lives were put at risk by a debunked conspiracy theory. Parents of Sandy Hook victims have been put through unspeakable emotional suffering due to harassment by “truthers” who believe the mass shooting was a false flag operation by the government and that the grieving family members are actors. By the time Dory’s investigation has completed, the body count of her quest exceeds that of the original crime she set out to rectify. In seeking to make herself a superhero, she’s made herself a monster. “Search Party” couldn’t be more timely and razor-sharp, capturing, in its noir spoof of a crime drama, a sharp satire of our true crime obsessions, conspiracy theory addictions and weakness for political sideshows, as well.  Throughout the arc of the season, the seductive tropes of the mystery and true crime genres are exploded and revealed for the farce they are, mere pleasing visions that allow each of us to imagine ourselves the heroic protagonist rather than someone who would fuck it all up if we stepped in. Conspiracy theories and crime shows let us imagine that we are capable, not culpable. As the show slowly reveals, humans can wreak untold damage when our self-perceived goodness and guiltlessness, rather than the actual effects of our actions, consume us. You can be highbrow.

ARTS & CULTURE,George Lucas Loves Art So Much He's Opening A $1 Billion Museum,"George Lucas is well known for his love of Wookiees, droids, Stormtroopers and interstellar cantina scenes. He’s less known for his love of Norman Rockwell paintings and R. Crumb comics. But according to The New York Times, we should probably get used to associating Lucas with the finer aspects of the art world, rather than just the intricacies of hairy humanoids from planet Kashyyyk. Why? Because the “Star Wars” creator is about to open a giant museum in Los Angeles that will house 10,000 paintings along with book and magazine illustrations. After years of planning, the museum’s board of directors announced on Tuesday that the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art will be built in Los Angeles at a cost of $1 billion. After previous attempts to place his vision in Chicago and San Francisco ― both of which were met with some opposition ― the filmmaker has decided to open the Lucas Museum near the coastal city’s Exposition Park, a popular spot for art institutions. ”This is the first museum of its kind, with an unprecedented collection that features fine art and popular art from illustration to comics, an insider’s perspective on the cinematic creative process and the boundless potential of the digital medium,” reads a statement on the museum’s website. It continues: The Lucas Museum will be a barrier free museum where artificial divisions between “high” art and “popular” art are absent, allowing you to explore a wide array of compelling visual storytelling. Visitors who might be less inclined to visit a traditional fine art museum will be invited to engage with and relate to art forms they recognize and love. The collection includes works by Edgar Degas, Winslow Homer and Pierre-Auguste Renoir, as well as illustrations, children’s art, comic art and photography from various periods. It will be housed in what’s been described by various press outlets as a “futuristic-looking” museum. Is it surprising that a Hollywood icon like Lucas would want to open a museum dedicated to both “high” and “popular” art? Probably not. After all, famous cultural critic Camille Paglia once dubbed him “the greatest artist of our time.”  And yes, “Star Wars” fans, there will be some objects from your favorite galactic epic in the museum mix, too."
ARTS & CULTURE,A Brick-And-Mortar Amazon Bookstore Is Coming To NYC,"Amazon shoppers, prepare yourselves: a giant Amazon bookstore is hitting Manhattan IRL this spring. A whopping 4,000 square feet of Time Warner Center will be taken over by the company as it opens its first physical retailer on the right coast (Amazon currently has bookstores in Oregon, Washington, and California). The NYC store is just the first of a few Amazon plans to open on this side of the country, with ones in New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Illinois to come. The decision to revert from the digital world to the real world stems from the fact that 91 percent of retail shopping that still happens in physical stores, the LA Times reports. “My expectation is Amazon will take all the best of online and apply it to the physical store,” Brendan Witcher, an analyst at research group Forrester, said to the Times. He added that a physical store would facilitate window displays to catch the attention of occasional shoppers and allow new users to “experience the Amazon brand.”  Not everyone is convinced by the sentiment behind Witcher’s pitch. “Amazon’s new brick and mortar bookstore is wildly banal,” Dustin Kurtz wrote for The New Republic. “The store ... betrays inexperience with retail.”  “Can’t Amazon let the book-selling old guard have anything?” HuffPost’s Claire Fallon asked. The Amazon Books news came not long after the announcement of Amazon Go just last month. Amazon Go, a Seattle-based grocery store, uses deep learning technology to allow customers to grab whatever they want and leave. "
ARTS & CULTURE,Chilling Book About Parental Love Is A Ghost Story For The Modern Age,"Imagine: You’re on vacation. A retreat to a small town. You’re hoping to lounge around, and maybe go swimming with your daughter, an energetic young girl, Nina. Suddenly, after a few odd run-ins with the locals, you’re not feeling so hot. You’re feverish, in fact; weak. Nina complains of feeling wobbly, too, a nightmare when your support system of family and doctors is out of reach. You decide to wait ― a mistake. You pass out, and when you wake up, you’re in a clinic, paralyzed. Nina’s nowhere in sight. There’s no one around but a boy named David, who’s urgently asking you details about the past few days, what you remember, when the illness started. The distressing setup of Samanta Schweblin’s Fever Dream ― her first novel, originally written in Spanish ― is only the beginning of an elliptical mystery that grows darker and hazier with each page. It’s a quick read that’ll leave you in a sweat, if not a panic. If you like your endings happy, or at least conclusive, the journey will be futile. But Fever Dream is worth reading for its inventiveness alone. Schweblin gives us memorable characters and a haunting parable, all in fewer than 200 short pages. We learn, entirely through dialogue between Amanda, the bedridden mother, and David, the boy at her bedside, about the origin of the strange sickness. At the start of her vacation, Amanda met a harried woman, Carla, who tells her the story of her son. Years ago, when Carla’s husband bred horses, she was caring for both a rented stud and her son, David, then a toddler. At once, both David and the horse venture to drink from murky water on their land, and in trying to rescue them both, she fails to save either from contamination. Both the horse and the boy get deathly ill, and Carla takes her son to visit the green house, a sort of alternative medicine center. There, a woman advises Carla to undergo a procedure that would split her son’s soul in two; he would never be wholly himself again, but he’d survive the infection. She agrees, although reluctantly, and afterward, she’s haunted by her son’s new appearance and demeanor. He’s covered in light spots. He’s found burying dead ducks in their backyard. To most questions, he issues the same droll response, “That’s not important.” Whether David’s transformation is the result of a half-body transplant, or something more earthly, like post-traumatic stress, is left open for interpretation. So, too, is the otherworldly nature of the contaminant both David and Amanda are exposed to. “They’re like worms,” David explains in the book’s opening lines. But are they actual parasites, or is the wriggling bodily sensation a psychological one? Schweblin never clarifies. The effect is that in her slim first novel, she taps into primal fears without ever naming them. The uncertainly is chilling, which is exactly the point. One detail that is expanded on is Amanda’s treasured concept of the parental “rescue distance,” a metaphorical rope she imagines between herself and Nina, one she never wants to let slack. She keeps the distance between them taut, and when she feels it loosen, she positions herself closer to her daughter as she plays and wanders. In her conversation with David, he dwells on the idea. He indicates that rare moments of imperfect motherly care are what put both of them in this sickly condition. Or, is an obsession with safety ― helicopter parenting, essentially ― the true risk? In the end, David takes measures to control his surroundings, while Schweblin does the opposite. She loosens the threads of her story, letting something strange and unsettling unravel. The bottom line: Fans of “Black Mirror” or “The Twilight Zone” might be drawn to the fantastical setup of Fever Dream, but may be dissatisfied with the book’s quiet, abstract ending. Otherwise, Schweblin’s quick, feverish story is worth reading for her intoxicating style alone.  Who wrote it: Schweblin’s stories have earned her plenty of accolades, including recognition from Granta as one of the best writers in Spanish under 35. This is her first novel, translated by Megan McDowell, whose also translated Alejandro Zambra’s work. Who will read it:  Readers interested in the surreal, the otherworldly. What other reviewers are saying: Washington Post: “Schweblin, though, is an artist of remarkable restraint, only dabbing on the atmospherics, while focusing her crystalline prose on the interior lives of the two mothers, Amanda and Carla, as well as the vagaries of memory.” The New Yorker: “I picked up ‘Fever Dream’ in the wee hours, and a low, sick thrill took hold of me as I read it. I was checking the locks in my apartment by page thirty. By the time I finished the book, I couldn’t bring myself to look out the windows.” Opening lines:  “They’re like worms What kind of worms? Like worms, all over.” Notable passage: “The thing is, I think over and over how strange my fear is, and it seems ridiculous to be already loading things into the car, with Nina still in her room, asleep. You’re trying to get away. Yes. But in the end I don’t, do I? No. Why not, David?

ARTS & CULTURE,The Folk Art Paintings Keeping Obama’s Legacy Alive In Urban Neighborhoods,"In black neighborhoods around the country, it’s easy to see what President Barack Obama means to residents: just look for the nearest mural, where he often appears, painted alongside figures such as Martin Luther King Jr. or Jesus.  Photographer Camilo José Vergara spent Obama’s two terms seeking out and documenting folk art paintings of the president in urban neighborhoods ― usually in areas that were poor, suffering from disinvestment and typically majority African-American. He found countless murals depicting Obama alongside civil rights icons, local heroes and other powerful figures. The art graces the sides of liquor stores, auto repair shops, barbershops, community centers, storefront churches and abandoned buildings. To Vergara, the paintings show hope, patriotism and “the feeling that Obama is the product of the African-American experience and African-American history,” sentiments he said have endured over the years. “There’s also a little bit of fear mixed with it. He’s out there, he’s vulnerable,” Vergara said, explaining that Obama is often painted alongside protective figures.   Vergara, a recipient of the National Humanities Medal and a MacArthur fellowship, has spent four decades taking photographs in neighborhoods grappling with decline. He’s returned to the same sites over and over to see how areas ― in cities including New York, Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles and Newark, New Jersey ― have changed.  Along the way, the Chilean-born photographer has paid particular attention to the local art that rarely makes it into museums.  Vergara has managed to track down the artists who painted some of the Obama murals, but other times their names aren’t known. Some pieces are painted over or demolished. Still, he sees himself as an “evangelist” for the work, documenting the individual pieces and showing their significance as part of the larger, ongoing collection.  “You don’t think of all of the stuff that was ephemeral, that came out on the walls and then disappeared, but it’s testimony to the way people saw the world,” he said. “This stuff gets left out of the picture, and that’s what I’m proud of, calling attention to it over and over and over again.”"
ARTS & CULTURE,Marlon James' New Fantasy Trilogy Is Inspired By 'LOTR' And African Epics,"Fantasy and sci-fi stories take place in faraway lands or alternate universes, but they still suffer from the same failures of representation as many 21st-century Hollywood films. Whether the setting is Middle Earth or Winterfell, almost everyone is white. An upcoming trilogy by author Marlon James will bring some much-needed diversity to the fantasy genre.  The Dark Star Trilogy by James, winner of the 2015 Man Booker Prize for his novel A Brief History of Seven Killings, is billed as the “African ‘Game of Thrones.’” The books will follow three characters ― the Tracker, the Moon Witch and the Boy ― as they decipher what went wrong in a search for a missing child. The main characters are three of eight mercenaries who were hired by a slave trader to track down a kidnapped kid. The book takes place nine years after that fact, when five of the mercenaries as well as the missing child are dead ― and seeks to put together the missing pieces using not-quite-reliable witness testimony. Expect mer-creatures, underworld darkness, magical techniques, a mysterious dwarf race and far more unadulterated geekery. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, James explained how his frustration with the lack of characters of color in existing fantasy books led him to create his own. “Originally it came from a fight that I had with somebody. I think it was when they announced the casting for ‘The Hobbit,’” James recalled. “I remember saying, ‘You know, if an Asian or a black hobbit came out of the Shire, nobody would have cared. We would have just moved on.’ And my friend said, ‘Well, Lord of the Rings is all this British and Celtic mythology.’ And I said, ‘Well, you know ... Lord of the Rings isn’t real.’ It just turned into one of these arguments we have about diversity and inclusion.” The writer summed up his stance in Man of the World magazine: “I realized how sick and tired I was of arguing about whether there should be a black hobbit in Lord of the Rings.” The works that helped shaped James’ trilogy are a multifarious spread, ranging from Angela Carter’s The Bloody Chamber to Marvel’s “Luke Cage,” Ursula K. Le Guin’s Earthsea to the paintings of Salvador Dalí. Yet James was particularly influenced by African epics like The Epic of Son-Jara and The Epic of Askia Mohammed, created around the same time as Beowulf. “It made me start to think about the fantastic African epic traditions — some of the stories I grew up with, like ‘Anansi the Spider,’” James told EW. “I just realized that there’s this huge pool of fantastic stories to draw from. It’s sort of like my being a scholar of African history and mythology, and my being a total sci-fi/fantasy geek who rereads things like The Mists of Avalon, they just sort of came together.” James is aiming to finish the books by the end of 2017, in time for a Fall 2018 release. At that point, 12-year-old sci-fi-heads and avid literature fans can finally join together and “geek the fuck out.”"
ARTS & CULTURE,J.K. Rowling Says Criticizing Donald Trump Is Both A 'Pleasure' And A 'Duty',"Meryl Streep made headlines Sunday night when she went after President-elect Donald Trump during a speech at the Golden Globes. The award-winning actress called out Trump for his bullying of a disabled reporter, saying “disrespect invites disrespect” and “violence incites violence.” The address made many Hollywood heavyweights proud, with several tweeting their support and admiration for Streep. Across the pond, “Harry Potter” author J.K. Rowling was also inspired. In response to a tweet that referenced the speech, Rowling made clear that she intended to follow Streep’s lead in vocally criticizing Trump, which she said was not only “a pleasure,” but “a duty.” If all famous people can constantly criticise Trump for the next four years he'll be too busy ranting on twitter to kill us all. When a pleasure becomes a duty. https://t.co/TZSpmbrtc2 Rowling was a vocal critic of Trump during his candidacy, once comparing him to the Harry Potter series’ most sinister character, Lord Voldemort. “Voldemort was nowhere near as bad” as Trump, she tweeted. After the Golden Globes, the president-elect took to Twitter to call Streep “one of the most over-rated actresses in Hollywood.” When a Twitter user pointed out to Rowling that Trump might come after her next, she had the perfect response.  Never forget that some people's good opinion would be more insulting than their abuse! pic.twitter.com/XYRCHTijQz Just like Streep, it doesn’t appear that Rowling will be clamoring for Trump’s approval anytime soon."
ARTS & CULTURE,D.C. Museum's 'Nasty Women' Tour Celebrates Art History's Feminist Heroes,"During the third presidential debate, Hillary Clinton was responding to a question about social security when Donald Trump notoriously interrupted her, muttering the phrase “Such a nasty woman,” not so under his breath. What Trump meant by those words was immediately and abundantly clear to women watching throughout the country, many of whom had been called similar slurs throughout their lives. It took approximately four seconds in Twitter-time for what the president-elect intended as an insult to become something of a feminist battle cry.  “A nasty woman is someone who refuses to be bound by the place society defined for her, someone who blazes her own trail,” Deborah Gaston, director of education at the National Museum of Women in the Arts, explained to The Huffington Post.  Although Clinton is the nasty woman that made the term go viral, ladies have been subverting restrictive gendered stereotypes and limitations for centuries. “Going back to the Renaissance,” Gaston continued, “women have been doing things they ‘shouldn’t.’ Well, they did it anyway, and they were successful.”  Since it was founded in 1987, the National Museum of Women in the Arts has worked to preserve and share the legacies of such subversive heroines, specifically those engaged in creative work. The only major museum in the world dedicated to celebrating the history of women-identified artists, the NMWA works to derail the longstanding habit of overlooking, undermining and erasing the work of women from the canon.  Located just three blocks from the White House, the museum often orchestrates programming that coincides with and addresses major political events. In light of the alarming amounts of misogyny that characterized the entirety of his campaign, addressing Trump’s upcoming presidential inauguration felt especially crucial. On Jan. 21 and 22, in honor of those participating in the Women’s March on Washington, admission to the NMWA will be free of cost. And on Sunday, Jan. 22, at 1 p.m., the museum will lead an hourlong “Nasty Women” tour, paying tribute to women in the NMWA’s permanent collection who thrived outside of societal norms and gendered expectations.   “It wasn’t just that these historical women were trying to do things they shouldn’t,” Gaston said. “There were literal restrictions on them; they had to negotiate social structures.” She identified 17th century scientific illustrator Maria Sibylla Merian as one of her favorite examples.  Merian, born in 1647 in Frankfurt, Germany, grew up in a time when butterflies were presumed to have demonic qualities. Nonetheless, she fell in love with the winged creatures and devoted her life to understanding their physical composition and life cycles through intensive observation. She chronicled her findings in scientific illustrations, staggering works of art that revealed previously unknown biological processes.  “She was someone who got married, had daughters, and then turned a corner at some point and pursued her passion for science and art,” Gaston expressed. “She made choices that were anathema to how women were supposed to lead their lives at the time. Maria left her marriage and, at 52, she brought her daughter to Suriname, a Dutch Colony in South America, for scientific research. As a single woman, alone without a male chaperone, a journey like that was unheard of. It was OK for women to paint flowers in their homes, but they didn’t just go into the rainforest unaccompanied.” At the time, scientists inspected the physical composition of bugs by examining preserved insect collections. Merian was the first to observe the living insects in their natural environments, discovering that bugs were not, in fact, born of the “spontaneous generation of rotting mud.” She archived her findings through delicate and scientifically accurate renderings that exist just at the nexus of art and science.  Despite her immense contributions to the realms of art and science, Merian is often overlooked by mainstream scholars, perhaps because of her lack of traditional training and, likely, her XX chromosomes. “Her intrepid spirit I found really fascinating,” Gaston gushed. “She never fully got credit for her work because she was a woman.” Merian’s work is joined by a variety of feminist artists from a wide array of eras, origins, and disciplines ― from Lavinia Fontana’s 16th century “Portrait of a Noblewoman” to Faith Ringgold’s 1997 quilt, immortalizing Josephine Baker’s 1920s banana dance. Oftentimes, the nastiness on view is twofold, in that both the artists and their chosen subjects are unorthodox, brazen and groundbreaking. “If you’re going to do a one-hour tour, there are only so many works you can fit in,” Gaston said. “We want to show that there have always been women in the arts pushing these boundaries this way.”  As inauguration weekend draws near, many in the art world and beyond are struggling with the appropriate way to react to and resist a Trump presidency. Many artists and critics are encouraging cultural institutions to go on strike for the day, and use the opportunity to re-imagine the roles theaters, museums, galleries and creative individuals will play in the coming years.  Yet, given the threat Trump poses to women’s rights around the nation, spending the weekend paying homage to nasty artists past and present, those who defied expectations and overcame obstacles to inscribe their singular visions onto the halls of history, seems appropriate. “Now it is even more necessary to have a place like the NMWA a few blocks from the White House,” Gaston said. “We’ve always fought to champion women through the arts. The idea of potentially being part of the nation’s conversation in a real way is something we’re really excited about.”  If you won’t be in Washington, D.C., for the Women’s March, don’t fret. The best part about the NMWA is that, in essence, every tour is a “Nasty Women” tour. As Gaston put it: “In a way, this tour is special, but in a way it’s what we always do. Here, it’s Women’s History Month every month. This is a perfect time for people to notice what we are doing here, but we’re doing it all the time.” The “Nasty Women” tour will take place Sunday, Jan. 22, at the National Museum of Women in the Arts, from 1–2 p.m. Museum admission will be free all weekend. Check out the NMWA website for additional programming related to the Women’s March. "
ARTS & CULTURE,The Painting Depicting Cops As Pigs Is Back On The Capitol Wall ... AGAIN,"UPDATE: Jan. 14, 12:30 p.m. ― It’s coming down again. UPDATE: Jan. 10, 5:08 p.m. ― Is the painting back up, you ask? Why, yes. Yes, it is.  https://t.co/fSLzOjloO9 UPDATE: Jan. 10, 4:20 p.m. ― At 3:55 p.m., Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.) and Rep. Brian Babin (R-Tx.) have once again removed the student painting from the Capitol complex tunnel and brought it, again, to Clay’s office.  In a video posted on Twitter, Rohrabacher explains the motivation behind this secondary removal of the work. “There are certain restrictions that apply,” he said. “If someone wants to do this in a private gallery they have every right with their freedom of speech, we support freedom of speech. But you don’t put something attacking policemen, treating them like pigs, here in the Capitol.”  What happens next is anyone’s guess. Well, the best guess would probably be Clay re-hanging the painting for reasons discussed below. Good thing there isn’t anything else super important going on today or anything!  Dana Rohrabacher and Brian Babin are taking the painting down again and bringing it to Clays office pic.twitter.com/d83Mj858bG UPDATE: Jan. 10, 2:06 p.m. ― Rep. Lacy Clay (D-Mo.) returned the controversial student painting depicting cops as pigs to its original location, according to Hill reporter Cristina Marcos. It is currently hanging in what Marcos described as “a highly trafficked tunnel connecting the Capitol and two House office buildings.” Clay rehung the work on Tuesday, surrounded by members of the Congressional Black Caucus, explaining to press, “This is really not about a student art competition anymore. This is about protecting the Constitution.” Rep. Duncan D. Hunter (R-Calif.), the GOP congressman who removed the painting without permission, is “pressuring GOP leaders to permanently remove the painting,” The Washington Examiner reports. “So [House Speaker Paul Ryan] got to do something about this,” Hunter told Fox News on Tuesday. “I can’t keep taking it down over and over. That becomes kind of a tit-for-tat thing. Artwork like this simply needs to not be up. The Capitol Police are behind me.” Rep. Lacy Clay (D-Mo) put the cops-as-pigs painting back on the wall in the Cannon Tunnel pic.twitter.com/hN7tiXX0ek Previously ... A GOP congressman removed a student painting, without warning or permission, from the walls of the U.S. Capitol complex on Friday, Jan. 6, because of its contentious depiction of police officers. The image ― a response to the 2014 protests of police brutality in Ferguson, Missouri ― shows a policeman with the head of a boar aiming a gun at a protestor with the head of a wolf. In the background, protestors hold signs reading “Stop Kill—,” “History” and “Racism Kills.” On the right, a black man in a graduation cap appears crucified and holding the scales of justice. The controversial artwork, made by recent high school graduate David Pulphus, was selected by a committee of artists as part of the annual U.S. Congressional Art Competition in May. The piece responded to the civil unrest brewing in Ferguson, where the competition was held, following the fatal shooting of Michael Brown by a white police officer.  “The painting portrays a colorful landscape of symbolic characters representing social injustice, the tragic events in Ferguson, Missouri, and the lingering elements of inequality in modern American society,” Rep. Lacy Clay (D-Mo.), who represents Ferguson, wrote in a statement. Until Friday, the piece hung in the Cannon House Office Building tunnel that connects the Capitol with members’ legislative offices.  Not everyone, however, was moved by the piece. According to Fox News, over 27,000 law enforcement officials protested Pulphus’ painting, specifically its depiction of cops as animals, describing the work as “reprehensible, repugnant and repulsive.” Police unions in New York, Los Angeles, San Jose, and Oakland collected their thoughts in a letter sent last Tuesday to House Speaker Paul D. Ryan. “This latest indignation, sponsored by an elected official intent on pandering to professional protesters, unfortunately adds credence to a demonstrably false narrative about law enforcement that undermines the safety of law enforcement officers and those we protect,” they wrote.  Yet Rep. Duncan D. Hunter (R-Calif.) acted alone and unprompted when he, on Friday, simply removed the painting from the tunnel wall and dropped it off in Rep. Clay’s office. Clay was out at the time. “It was an impulsive thing when I walked by,” Hunter said of his decision, in an interview with The St. Louis Post-Dispatch. “It strikes a nerve ... You shouldn’t have something in the Capitol that depicts cops as pigs. It’s that simple.” In response to the many people offended by the work, Clay suggested thinking about the artist’s motivation for the painting, rather than just the piece itself. “The bigger conversation we should be having is, ‘Why does this kid feel that way?’” Clay told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.  Earlier this month, Clay released a statement explaining his refusal to remove the work despite its criticisms because of the First Amendment’s protection of provocative artwork. “I had no role in selecting the winner of this student art competition and I would never attempt to approve or disapprove artistic expression,” he said. “The U.S. Capitol is a symbol of freedom, not censorship. The young artist chose his own subject and the painting will not be removed.” Whether or not Clay will re-hang the work after it has been removed remains to be seen. We have reached out to Clay’s office for comment and will update accordingly. "
ARTS & CULTURE,'I Am Not Your Negro' Trailer Shows The Lasting Power Of James Baldwin's Words,"“The story of the Negro in America is the story of America,” intones Samuel L. Jackson early in the trailer for “I Am Not Your Negro.” “It is not a pretty story.” The words are James Baldwin’s; the documentary, by Raoul Peck, is based on the author’s final, unfinished book, Remember This House. The manuscript was meant to explore the interwoven lives and shocking deaths of Medgar Evers, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, Jr. ― three Civil Rights–era leaders who were assassinated in the 1960s. Though the book did not come close to being finished prior to Baldwin’s death, Peck mined the pages of notes left behind as a jumping-off point for “I Am Not Your Negro.” The documentary, which received rave reviews after premiering at the Toronto International Film Festival, combines clips of Baldwin speaking in forceful, fiery terms on racism in America with Jackson’s solemn, rumbling delivery of lines from his famous and never-published writings alike. Few have matched the author of The Fire Next Time and Go Tell It on the Mountain for insight and searingly eloquent prose on the subject of black American oppression. Peck leans into this advantage by featuring only Baldwin’s words in the film. In the Village Voice, Odie Henderson applauded the documentary for “masterfully syncing Baldwin’s words to a series of images that bind past and present.” As this chilling trailer reveals, just a handful of Baldwin’s words and few shocking images from the civil rights struggle can speak volumes ― and, sadly, the message has never been more relevant. “I Am Not Your Negro” is finally coming to theaters on Feb. 3. Watch the trailer above. H/T Flavorwire"
ARTS & CULTURE,Artists Call For Global Culture Strike On America's Inauguration Day,"On Friday, Jan. 20, 2017, Donald Trump will be sworn in as the 45th president of the United States. In protest of the occasion, a group of 130 artists and critics have signed a petition calling for cultural institutions around the nation to close for the entire day. The J20 Art Strike implores museums, galleries, schools, non-profits, studios, theaters and concert halls to refrain from conducting business as usual in an attempt to resist what organizers call the “normalization of Trumpism ― a toxic mix of white supremacy, misogyny, xenophobia, militarism, and oligarchic rule.” Instead, creative citizens are called upon to hit the streets, protest and recalculate the role of such cultural spaces over the next four years. “We consider Art Strike to be one tactic among others,” the petition states. “Like any tactic, it is not an end in itself, but rather an intervention that will ramify into the future. It is not a strike against art, theater, or any other cultural form. It is an invitation to motivate these activities anew, to reimagine these spaces as places where resistant forms of thinking, seeing, feeling, and acting can be produced.” Given the sweeping socioeconomic disparities in the art world, the Art Strike aims to prioritize voices that are particularly threatened by Trump’s impending presidency. It challenges art-world actors to protect the importance of diversity, individuality and free self-expression in a time when the future of such values remains in question. “However you choose to respond to this call, Art Strike is an occasion for public accountability, an opportunity to affirm and enact the values that our cultural institutions claim to embody,” the petition states. Artists including Joan Jonas, Barbara Kruger, Simone Leigh, Cindy Sherman, Trevor Paglen and Dread Scott are among the signees along with critics Hilton Als, Chris Kraus and Lucy Lippard. Some art institutions, however, have resolved to remain open during the inauguration day, including the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in Los Angeles. Miranda Carroll, LACMA’s director of communications, explained the museum’s stance in an email to The New York Times: “Our entire program and mission, every day, is an expression of inclusion and appreciation of every culture.” The Outsider Art Fair will also take place throughout inauguration weekend in New York. While most art-world inhabitants abstaining from the protest believe in both the importance of open art institutions and J20 Art Strike’s overall mission, Guardian art critic Jonathan Jones strongly doubts the strike’s effectiveness.  “Such a protest can only help the participants feel good about themselves. It is at best a way of saying ‘not in my name,’ and cannot conceivably do anything to curb Trump or ensure his electoral defeat next time around,” Jones wrote in an op-ed on Monday. He continued, “Let’s face it: art and serious culture are completely marginal to American life. Trump’s victory proves that. Closing museums is not likely to have any impact on those who support him. With all due respect, they might be affected a lot more if reality television shows went on strike.” Jones’ comments come just after Meryl Streep used her Golden Globes achievement award speech to condemn Trump’s bullying as well as his hostility toward immigrants and the press. Whether or not such acts of defiance from the creative sphere will influence the president-elect is yet to be seen, though at the very least, Streep got under his skin. As Inauguration Day draws near, cultural institutions and creative individuals can decide for themselves whether or not an art strike is the appropriate reaction to what will be, for many, a difficult day. But for those who decide to strike, you have some very gifted artists and thinkers on your side. "
ARTS & CULTURE,"Social Media Friendships, Artists As A Tribe And An Homage To Artist David Park (1911-1960)","As someone who spends a ton of time on social media — way too much — I have been thinking a lot about friendship lately. On the one hand, while I have literally thousands of “friends,” there are only a handful that I actually know in person and perhaps one or two that would reach for me if I were sinking in a pit of quicksand. It’s a situation where there is quick, momentary gratification available nearly all the time, but deep, profound connections seem at risk. Real friends and real friendships are difficult to schedule and just so inconvenient, right?  Some days it seems like we are all heading towards a future when we will choose Instagram likes over food, sex or human interaction: lab rats in a dystopian social media aquarium who “unfriend” anyone on doesn’t “like” us or our politics. I’m as guilty as anyone in this regard — so please note the confession of my hypocrisy as you read this on my Facebook — but this blog is actually intended to point out something positive: being connected with artists and others who love and are involved with art has given me (and many others) an unprecedented sense of belonging and camaraderie.  There is a sense of tribalism shared by art world types — as varied as they may be — that is grounded in some very genuine shared concerns. I became interested this sense of community a few years ago and it motivated me to write a blog for Hyperallergic about the painter Mark Dutcher, who had somehow managed to build a very genuine and intimate community through his Facebook posts. I admired that and am sorry to say that Mark is no longer on Facebook... but you can find him on Instagram.  Through social media and blogging I have met innumerable artists and managed to interview over 100 of them.  I do my interviews on the phone and via e-mail — not as good as having lunch together, I know — and even across that distance I am often moved by what artists tell me.  One great example of something profound and unforgettable that has been said to me is this anecdote from a 2011 interview of  painter Kyle Staver: I love that story for so many reasons, not the least of which is that I can also remember feeling like an outsider until I met a teacher — Nathan Oliveira — who helped me recognize that I was an artist who “belonged” to a tribe that I hadn’t previously known existed. To break down the inherent distance of social media friendships, I do what I can to meet my art tribe friends in the real world when I can manage. Case in point, when I noticed that artist Lisa Pressman had come to Los Angeles to visit a relative I messaged her and was able to meet her in person for the first time and view John McLauglin Paintings: Total Abstraction at the LA County Museum of art. Art is about a lot of things, and I think friendship and conversation are two of the most important and seeing art with another another artist is tremendously gratifying and interesting.  Honestly, the more I think about it, there is something profound about the way art forms communities, both online and in the “real” world. Some of the communities that I have noted and admired lately include the artists who support and are in turn supported by Poets and Artists and it’s founder-entrepreneur Didi Menendez. Although I haven’t visited in person — but I will this Spring — I’m in awe of the community that has evolved around Art Division, founded by painter Dan McCleary: it’s an LA based program that trains underserved young adults in the visual arts. Finally, I thought it was extraordinary how the Atlanta arts community rallied around art dealer Alan Avery  this past November to raise $50,000 to help Alan cope with a medical emergency.  Is it possible that making, being around and caring about art actually enhances one’s empathy, sense of caring and ability to build and maintain meaningful friendships? I honestly think it does. Which brings me to a story I want to tell.  In 1945 a young man named Sam Francis was a patient at Fort Miley Veterans’ Hospital in San Francisco. Sam was suffering greatly from spinal tuberculosis and injuries that he had suffered during a training flight crash a year and a half before. When Francis took up painting in bed to divert his mind, the artist and teacher David Park heard about it and came to visit. Over time, he made numerous visits, talked to Sam about painting, brought works by Klee and Miro and left them overnight and even arranged for Sam — who was lying flat on a stretcher in a body cast — to visit the De Young Museum when it was closed. Years later, Sam Francis would tell his friend John Hultberg that David Park had saved his life by encouraging him to paint. David Park also juried Sam Francis — who later went on to a stellar career as a leading abstract artist — into his first exhibition.  This story is a testament to the power of friendships between artists and their transformative power. It should be mentioned that as a teenager, Park had  been rescued from a boarding school where he was miserable by his artist/aunt Edith Park Truesdell. Some what he did for Sam Francis must have had an aspect of “paying it forward” that came from his aunt’s example of friendship and encouragement.  In his life and in his art, David Park was just an extremely decent and caring person. The representational paintings that made him famous in the last decade of his life are filled with humanity and empathetic observations about what it means to be human. When I saw a David Park retrospective as a student in 1977, I was very moved by this aspect of Park’s work: so much so that I wrote a letter to his widow Lydia, who generously sent me a Park drawing as a gift. That gift, and the affection I continue to feel for Park through the experience of his work has been a continuing source of inspiration.  To honor David Park’s legacy, I am helping organize an exhibition scheduled to run from April 3rd - 28th, 2017 at Santa Clara University. Supported by a grant from the Sam Francis Foundation, the exhibition will showcase the works of two invited artists who have looked hard at Park and learned from his example — Jennifer Pochinski and Kyle Staver — and will also feature a juried exhibition featuring between 20 and 25 additional artists. This exhibition is not intended to showcase paintings that simply resemble Park’s works, but rather to honor his legacy of artistic honesty, strong work ethic, and commitment to the figure. If you are an artist who has been inspired by Park’s legacy, or who shares in his vision of humanity, I hope you will consider submitting your work to the jury for this show. This show will hopefully offer recognition and encouragement to all who participate: it is meant as a form of community and an offer of friendship between artists.  Information about “Honoring the Legacy of David Park” and an online entry form can be found at this link. "
ARTS & CULTURE,So THAT'S What 'OK' Stands For,"”OK” may be one of the most commonly used words in America. Want to grab a drink after work? OK. How are you feeling? I’m OK. Justin Bieber is the best singer of all time. OK ... But did you know that every time you throw “OK” around you’re using the 1840s slang equivalent of phrases like “bae” or “it’s lit fam”? As explained in the Mental Floss video above, late lexicographer Allen Walker Read traced OK’s origin back to a Boston newspaper editor who in 1839 used the initials as a trendy, clever way of saying “oll korrect,” or, more accurately, “all correct.” The editor was playing into a popular 19th century trend in which writers would playfully abbreviate and misspell their words. For example, they’d use “KG” to say “know go,” which means “no go.” It’s similar to how people today use “bae” for “baby” or “before anyone else,” or how millennials will text “it’s lit fam” to describe to their friends that something is amazing or fun.  But “OK” came around at a time when catchy phrases are most important: a presidential election.   During Martin Van Buren’s 1840 bid for president, his campaign turned his nickname, “Old Kinderhook,” into a hip and catchy slogan: “He’s Old Kinderhook and he’s oll korrect.” More than 170 years later, “OK” has all but taken over.  Want to know the rest of “OK’s” history? Watch Mental Floss’s video above, OK?"
ARTS & CULTURE,Reminder: Boycotting Milo Yiannopoulos' Publisher Is Not Censorship,"On Dec. 29, “alt-right” boy wonder Milo Yiannopoulos announced that he’d signed a $250,000 deal with Simon & Schuster’s conservative imprint, Threshold, to write a book entitled Dangerous. By the end of the day, social media was in an uproar. Petitions begging his publisher to rescind the contract were circulating, while others, including Chicago Review of Books and indie bookshop Raven Books, announced they’d be boycotting all Simon & Schuster titles in response.  To many free speech advocates, this backlash was more troubling than the initial book deal. On Thursday, the National Coalition Against Censorship published a statement defending the publisher’s right to publish Yiannopoulos’ work, no matter how offensive. The statement, also signed by industry advocacy organizations including the Association of American Publishers, the Authors Guild, and the National Council of Teachers of English, argued that a boycott of Simon & Schuster would have a “chilling effect” on publishers that would undermine dissemination of diverse ideas: This kind of response will have a chilling effect on authors and publishers, which is undoubtedly the goal of those who support such boycotts. However, the suppression of noxious ideas does not defeat them; only vigorous disagreement can counter toxic speech effectively. Shutting down the conversation may temporarily silence disfavored views, but does nothing to prevent them from spreading and resurfacing in other ways. Whether “vigorous disagreement” can effectively neutralize hateful speech seems more questionable than ever in recent months. A November essay by an anonymous columnist in The Guardian confessed that the accessibility and popularity of alt-right vitriol ― including Yiannopoulos’ own work ― temporarily seduced him into harboring racist views. “If it can get somebody like me to swallow it ― a lifelong liberal ― I can’t imagine the damage it is doing overall,” he wrote. After backlash erupted in response to a now-canned A&E show intended to follow Ku Klux Klan members, an anecdote about Oprah’s decision to no longer interview neo-Nazis on her show, after a 1988 segment, resurfaced. Having hosted a group of white nationalists onstage for a segment meant to stir vigorous and provocative discussion, Oprah later recalled, “I actually thought for a long time that through the power of conversation, I could break down barriers of racism or homophobia.” Instead, what she discovered as she hosted a jeering crowd of skinheads eager to broadcast their agenda, was that “the power of the platform” was greater than the power of debate. “I went, whoa, I think I’m doing one thing. I think I’m exposing them, I think I’m showing them in their vitriol and their dark side, and trying to get them to see another point of view, and they are using me.” She realized, “I think I’m doing good here, and I’m not.”  Anti-censorship organizations and critics of the boycott movements have equated any successful push to have Yiannopoulos’ contract rescinded with a form of censorship, if a less direct form than governmental restrictions on speech. But lacking a sponsored platform for one’s views is a fate long suffered by women and, especially, minority groups who have been boxed out of access to those platforms. The default, in American history, has been that marginalized groups simply weren’t offered book deals or staff positions to disseminate their ideas to begin with, while white men with all manner of noxious views were paid to propagate theirs without consequence to themselves ― just to the underprivileged people targeted by toxic screeds. By the same token that most of us will never get book deals, no one is owed a book deal or any sort of megaphone, even by virtue of possession being nine-tenths of the law. For those affected by the willingness of gatekeepers to participate in spreading hateful speech, protest and boycott don’t register as censorship, but a meaningful response to the propagation of harmful speech directed at their communities.  In a phone conversation with HuffPost, NCAC Executive Director Joan Bertin, emphasized, “We’re not saying readers can’t boycott, of course they can.” Instead, she says, “Our hope is that publishers will support their authors.”  So far, Simon & Schuster has stood behind their new author, now with the support of a coalition of anti-censorship organizations. (Jon Anderson, president and publisher of Simon & Schuster’s Children’s Publishing Division, is a member of the NCAC board of directors; however, Bertin stated to HuffPost that “he had nothing to do with the statement or our decision to issue it.”) Free speech is enshrined in our Constitution, protecting us from overt governmental censorship of ideas. When it comes to private citizens’ protests, and private companies’ responses, the concept of “censorship” grows far more muddled. Protesting Dangerous might have a chilling effect on publishers; then again, Yiannopoulos’ own words and encouragement of racist harassment had such a chilling effect that they drove actress and comedian Leslie Jones from Twitter. He’s also famously advocated that women leave the internet because they’re “ruining it” for men with their annoying opinions. For her part, Bertin sees no conflict: “These are not principles that can readily be applied in a one-sided fashion,” she told HuffPost. “In my experience it’s been the advocates of progressive causes that have most often been silenced. So in order to protect those rights for those people, we have to say, you know, Milo’s got the same right.” Though Yiannopoulos has the right to express his opinions, it’s nonetheless troubling to see his ideology, which propagates disdain and contempt for various vulnerable groups of people, given an immense platform. Though we don’t want to sand the edges off our discourse in the name of a comfortable consensus, at some point, it’s reasonable to ask gatekeepers to answer for elevating deliberately harmful views. Given that Yiannopoulos’ range of targets have historically been subject to comprehensive oppression, admonishing critics to engage with his abhorrent views through debate while watching him, and his publisher, profit off of his dissemination of racist, sexist ideology, doesn’t seem like the best solution. It elevates hatred and invalidation of nonwhite humanity into a category of debatable thought, leaving marginalized groups to politely argue for their own right to be in the room at all. At a time when women are leaving Twitter because of sexist abuse and an incoming president has hinted that he doesn’t support full freedom of the press, worrying over petitions to rescind a book contract to a bully and alt-right troll seems almost beside the point. Questioning a major outlet’s decision to give Yiannopoulos such a powerful platform, given his body of work, isn’t censorship, especially since, unfortunately, it seems he’s going to have more than enough opportunity to exploit it.

ARTS & CULTURE,Let's Eat Grandma Is Your Teenage Nightmare,"Once upon a time, two childhood friends began to play music and lay traps ― and, sometimes, both at once.  Now 17 and 18 years old, respectively, Rosa Walton and Jenny Hollingworth are Let’s Eat Grandma, a psychedelic pop group whose sound resembles a molten lullaby that’s spawned hallucinatory properties. The band’s uncanny name stems from an old grammar joke about the importance of commas ― they save lives! But, after listening to their music, a different image comes to mind: one of two fairy-tale children (think Gretel or Little Red Riding Hood) who, after finding their way to grandmother’s house, as fairy-tale children often do, decide to derail their sugary narrative with a cannibalistic twist. As Hollingworth told The Huffington Post, “It’s more complicated than ‘happily ever after.’” Walton and Hollingworth grew up in Norwich, which Hollingworth described as a “quite classic English town.” The two met in school when they were 4 years old. In the other, each recognized a familiar macabre sense of humor and a taste for mischief. In those formative years before one reaches double digits, Walton and Hollingworth enjoyed climbing onto rooftops and building tree houses. Also, playing pranks. “We used to have this fake package we attached to a string and left on the street,” Walton recalled. “When people would try to pick up the package, we’d yank the string and make them jump.” They cackled at the recollection. “It’s kind of what we do onstage ― get reactions out of people.” At 13 years old, Walton and Hollingworth began making music together, picking up a motley range of instruments including keyboard, guitar, drums, saxophone, harmonica, mandolin, cello, recorder, glockenspiel and ukulele. While many girls have experience escaping, within their own circles, into fantastical worlds of their own making, few execute their imagination-fueled undertakings with such skill and nuance.  In June of 2016 they dropped their debut album, “I, Gemini,” a dark, dreamlike thing that balances childish folksiness with baroque experimentalism. Their lyrics spin tales of skipping school, chimpanzees, lucid dreams and the enchanting luminescence of shiitake mushrooms ― sometimes sung, rapped in a baby animal’s chirrup or chanted in the dazed tenor of a possessed youth chorus. Words are layered atop textured soundscapes that will make you dance while easing you into a trance. The women of LEG are well aware of the preconceptions that come along with being a musical group of teenage girls. Rather than objecting, they toy with their audience’s assumptions, amping up their innocent girlishness while hinting at the depraved underbelly beneath the surface. On stage, the ladies often shield their faces with their waist-length tresses, until they resemble witchy, pre-Raphaelite twins. They’ve been known to disarm crowds by performing secret handshakes and screaming in tandem during shows, promptly shattering any expectations casting female musicians as demure, ladylike songstresses.  In their recent video “Sax in the City,” the two dress up as overgrown babies, crawling on city streets in frilly, pink bonnets and sucking pacifiers. At one point, they play Crayola-colored toy instruments while reclining in an overflowing ball pit, a nod to those who refuse to see them as anything other than little girls playing with the boys’ toys. “Sometimes we almost do experiments to see what people think,” Hollingworth said of the video. “It’s interesting, assuming how you think people will react and then seeing how they actually do. I’m not sure if they entirely got that one.” Walton and Hollingworth are quick to describe themselves as “witches” and “freaks,” labels that speak to something true about themselves while simultaneously messing with preconceptions. In part, they believe others’ judgments stem from a deep-seeded fear of girls and female friendships. “People have all these presumptions about female friendship like there is something dangerous about it,” Hollingworth said. “It’s almost like they can’t imagine women having the same drive to create things as men ― which is utter crap.” The widespread fiction that young women aren’t capable, creatively or intellectually, is nothing new, as evidenced by the uproar over a political Teen Vogue article last month. LEG uses this falsehood as a springboard for fantasy, putting on a creepy-cute freak show that reflects their audience’s fears and fantasies back at them. In a stellar piece for MTV, writer Hazel Cills paid tribute to the contemporary women musicians who, in their music videos, subvert the horror genre ― long used to symbolize and dramatize violence against women ― to express feminine perspectives of aggression and desire. LEG falls into this genre, disrupting normative gender stereotypes through jarring imagery that lingers in the memory like a discombobulating nightmare. They play, however, not the roles of sexy vampires à la Jenny Hval or blood-soaked brides like Bat for Lashes, but the ever-eerie role of the creepy twins, seen everywhere from “The Shining” to Diane Arbus’ work. The idea of twin-ness extends beyond LEG’s persona to their music and visuals, which always tackle their subject matter in doublespeak, whole-heartedly and with a mischievous wink. “Sometimes our lyrics are true, but the video is the other way around,” Walton put it. Hollingworth chimed in: “We try to express two different sides of the same song. Maybe we’re making fun of something, but there is something else behind it.”  Along with horror, LEG draws heavily from fairy tales and folktales in their work. One song, “Rapunzel,” mashes up elements of the classic narrative with the horrific real-life story of Genie, a feral child who was abused and kept in captivity by her father for 13 years. In LEG’s world, the age-old tales meant to serve as women’s fantasies often frame their female protagonists as silent and still ― yielding more frightful a fate than the most heinous news clippings.   My cat is dead, my father hit meI ran away, I’m really hungryThat wicked witch, in all her powerShe cast a spell and locked me in this towerI can’t look down, I’m claustrophobicPlease, let me out, I can’t deserve thisI hate my name, I’m not that RapunzelMy hair’s not blonde, and I’m not having fun ... In part, the lyrics mimic a child’s spinning mind, being lulled to sleep with a bedtime story while very real fears gurgle beneath the drafted happy ending. “The idea of being kidnapped always freaked me out when I was kid,” Walton said. “It’s something I was always worried about ― someone coming into the house and stealing me.”  But the song also gets at just how much fairy tales have been censored and sanitized by injecting Rapunzel’s tale with some fangs and claws. Today, fairy tales are often thought to be the puritanical and patriarchal stuff of Brothers Grimm collections and Disney films. But before they were catalogued by men in the 16th century, the myths lived on the tongues and in the ears of women. And rather than reiterating tired tales of pretty princesses waiting for their prince, the timeless legends addressed the vital journeys and desires of a woman’s life ― often expressed through haunting tales dense with blood, flesh and food.  With dark humor and boundless imagination, the young women of LEG return folktales to their original, oral habitats. Their first album and its accompanying visuals artfully balance innocence and know-how ― seriousness and make-believe ― slashing gendered preconceptions of fairy tales and their contemporary counterpoint: pop music. And the artists are, still, only teenagers. “We’ve got quite a lot of energy, and a lot of time ahead of us,” Walton said. “Hopefully,” she added, with a smirk.  Every Friday, HuffPost’s Culture Shift newsletter helps you figure out which books you should read, art you should check out, movies you should watch and music should listen to.

ARTS & CULTURE,Great Science Fiction Isn’t Just About Facts. It’s About Imagination.,"Warning: if you haven’t watched “The OA” but plan to, we don’t recommend spoiling it by reading this post.  When Andy Weir first self-published The Martian ― a book that troubles itself with scientific accuracy, but not, say, the color of its protagonist’s hair ― it was a quick hit. His 99-cent ebook sold 35,000 copies before publishers took notice and Crown Publishing bought the rights. The rest is history. Or a version of it, starring Matt Damon. The book made it to The New York Times’ bestseller list, an impressive feat for a title belonging to the thought-to-be esoteric subgenre of “hard” sci-fi, or sci-fi concerned more with the “sci” half of the mashup. Readers reveled in Weir’s technical proficiency (his dad’s a particle physicist). Reviews were mixed, but leaned positive. A “B” review from Entertainment Weekly laments, “The men and women we see in action on the ship and at NASA are brainy but dour. Still, the technical details keep the story relentlessly precise and the suspense ramped up.” As readers, and viewers, it seems we can be more willing to overlook these character-centered shortcomings, more so than we’re able to suspend our belief for the unreal, or the accurate-ish. Just look at “The OA,” the surprise show that debuted at the tail end of last year, controversial for its ending ― called out as off-color by critics ― but also for its ethereal message. The eight-episode Netflix project follows a girl who’s returned to her hometown after a long disappearance. When she left, she was blind; now, inexplicably, she can see. The girl’s adoptive parents named her Prairie, but after her presumed abduction she calls herself “the OA,” a title that remains cryptic for much of the season. We learn that the OA had a near-death experience, or NDE, as a child in Russia, where she was the sole survivor of a sinking bus crash. Before the accident, she had ominous dreams that predicted it in flashes, and she always woke up with a nosebleed, a quirk that led reviewers to draw comparisons between “The OA” and Eleven from “Stranger Things.” (The connection is mostly superficial.) During her NDE, the OA tells a sort of goddess-guardian-oracle named Khatun that she wishes to return to Earth. And she’s able to, but at the cost of her sight. She’s then shipped off to America, where she lives with her absent, extended family until she’s adopted by the Johnsons, a kindly couple that raises her in the suburbs.  The OA ― who’s still going by Prairie Johnson at this point ― is tormented most nights by her nosebleed-inducing dreams, which she interprets as premonitions. The Johnsons view her behavior as problematic and seek to medicate her; whether she’s experiencing psychotic breaks or truly supernatural phenomena is left ambiguous on purpose. Eschewing empirical evidence in favor of an individual’s lived experiences, the show’s portrayal of Prairie ― and later, the OA ― is one of acceptance and imagination. When we’re asked to consider that her premonitions might have real, physical consequences somewhere beyond her reeling, traumatized brain, we’re forced to take them seriously. She’s more than just crazy; empathy is born.  This idea is threaded through as the story builds. We eventually learn that, during her absence, Prairie was held captive by Hap, a man doing research on NDEs, along with a rotating cycle of fellow abductees. He’s researching where they go when they nearly die ― what happens to their minds, or spirits ― by drugging them and drowning them over and over. We also learn that Khatun gifted Prairie a bird from the afterlife, which she swallowed, granting her the ability to dance or move in a specific way that feels, to her, important. It sounds like mumbo-jumbo belonging to the same family as healing crystals, but one of the other captives, Homer, is on board with her theory that they each must complete these coordinated movements together in order to escape. Over the course of years, the “movements” are born, these jerky gestures that look like either rituals from a far-off ancient land, or a trendy new workout fusing yoga with Zumba. (The OA, it’s worth noting, looks like she’s scoured the sale room at Urban Outfitters, further imbuing the show with this decade’s particular brand of New Ageiness.) When she’s set free, the OA makes her way back to the Johnsons, but yearns to return to Homer and the captives she left behind. She scrounges up a crew of high school students and one teacher, who for their own varied reasons are intrigued by the OA’s story and wish to help her. There’s Betty, a teacher who’s mourning her twin brother; Alfonso, a promising student-athlete who piles on responsibilities at home; Buck, a transgender teen; Jesse, a soft-spoken orphan; and Steve, whose violent tendencies could land him in military school. They become the OA’s captive audience, stand-ins for the family she lost in Hap’s damp basement prison. They learn the movements, not knowing when or why they’ll need to perform them in the future. Then, in the final scene of the final episode, it becomes clear: the OA’s crew performs their dance in the midst of a school shooting, and it’s so bizarrely distracting that the shooter pauses long enough to be taken out. The plot choice has been criticized and defended. Tasteful or not, it casts off the idea that it matters whether or not the OA’s premonitions are real or in her head. The effect is real, and that’s what counts. Not everyone agrees. Writing for Gizmodo, in a post titled “The OA Is Bullshit, But It’s Beautiful Bullshit,” Evan Narcisse says, “the lack of closure feels like a calculated ploy to avoid delivering a concrete answer to its central mystery.” But it would seem that the lack of closure ― of clarity about the OA’s true backstory ― is the point. The imagination, the show posits, is as real as the real world. And before you dismiss such a takeaway as wishy-washy, remember that it’s the crux of so many beloved stories. In the final installment of Harry Potter, Dumbledore upholds the realness of the imagination by reminding Harry, “of course it is happening inside your head [...] but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?”; in Where the Wild Things Are, Max’s wild rumpus matters not because it was or wasn’t a dream, but because of what the hero gleans from his adventures. In William freakin’ Shakespeare’s plays, the substantiality of false worlds is celebrated again and again. It’s arguable that the concept has helped shaped storytelling as we know it. Depending on who you ask, the concept is timeless or hackneyed. But it certainly isn’t cheap.  In a Facebook chat with The Huffington Post, writer Lidia Yuknavitch — whose Chronology of Water explores the fluidity of our bodies, our genders, and the stories we tell, and whose forthcoming novel, The Book of Joan, approaches sci-fi anthropologically ― praised “The OA” as a show about “desire toward meaning-making kissing desire of the body.” “I have a gigantic crush on the creative mind of Brit Marling,” she said. “I think we are in DIRE need of redefining what we mean by ‘spiritual’ today, away from old theologies and dead myths that relied on god the father. I think new paradigms are being born like new stars, bringing us closer to ourselves, and new forms and themes in storytelling are emerging. Thank the night sky.” She added that criticisms of the show as wishy-washy pseudoscience are unfounded. “I think it’s a little reductive to call ‘the OA’ a ‘spiritual’ show without adding to that the helix made of spirituality and astrophysics ... you know, hard science. The many worlds theory, string theory, the ‘music’ made from Saturn’s rings,” Yuknavitch said. It’s true that “The OA” is a new kind of science fiction, at least for mainstream audiences. But its heavy reliance on bald emotions, occasionally corny mantras and theories that could’ve been plucked from college dorm rooms doesn’t mean that it isn’t also rooted in the fascinating facts of the universe. Like its heroine, the show has a foot in reality, a foot in unreality. Asking it to commit to one or the other would only rid it of its wonder.

ARTS & CULTURE,"Weird, There's An Alexis Bledel In This ‘Handmaid’s Tale’ Adaptation","What’s an Alexis Bledel for? The actress made famous for her portrayal of Rory Gilmore tends to be typecast in roles defined by youthful naivety: Winnie Foster in “Tuck Everlasting,” Lena in “Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants.” In a “Mad Men” appearance, she’s involved in an affair with Pete Campbell, who seems to like that her spontaneity foils his wife’s orderliness. Thursday, Vulture wrote that she’s been cast in a part that strays from her norm. She’ll play Ofglen, opposite Elisabeth Moss, whose starring as Offred, in Hulu’s adaptation of The Handmaid’s Tale. The story follows Offred as she navigates an oppressive society, where women are forced to adhere to a chaste dress code and mate with the men to whom they’re assigned. Offred is separated from her husband and daughter, and she confides in Ofglen about the memories of her past. Ofglen’s character is no shrinking violet. She finds her subservient role in the Republic of Gilead suffocating, and acts out accordingly. The part will either be a refreshing change for Bledel, who, in the “Gilmore Girls” revival plays a character with little agency, or a missed opportunity for the show.  (It’s worth noting that Bledel’s tried out more subversive roles before; In “Sin City” she plays Becky, a member of a woman-led clan that eventually traps and kills a wayward cop.) Regardless of your thoughts on the casting choice, The Handmaid’s Tale may be worth watching for its relevancy alone. Earlier this week, the book’s author, Margaret Atwood, released a statement about the similarities between the fictional world she created and the current political climate."
ARTS & CULTURE,The Hip-Hop Artists Who Use Words To Change The World,"Emmanuel Jal, born in South Sudan, was only 8 years old when he was recruited to fight as a soldier in the Sudanese Civil War along with 12,000 other children. Miraculously, Jal was one of the few to escape, eventually finding his way to Kenya and enrolling in school. Today, he is a rapper, actor and social activist, who spins verses about his personal biography and his ongoing crusade for peace around the world. “I used to have a lot of nightmares,” Jal expressed in an interview with NPR. “Life was difficult then. But music became the place [where] I was able to see heaven. So through music I was able to dance, I was able to become a child again.” Jal is one of the subjects pictured in “Forthright ― Stronger than a Weapon,” a photography series by German photographer Sascha Kraus. The project pictures 43 hip-hop artists from Africa, Europe, Asia and the United States, all of whom use their craft to advocate for world peace and universal human rights. Far from just an exercise in frivolous entertainment, rap music is framed through Kraus’ lens as a bold and uncompromising tool for social change. “I am fascinated by what the artists do with their music,” Kraus said in an interview with Freelens. “With my project ‘Forthright,’ I would like to give them a platform and show what influence this movement has on a global scale.” Kraus pictures his subjects both performing and at rest, in black-and-white and in color, the depictions suggesting that a human being, when immersed in her element, can become something more.  Another featured rapper, Sister Fa, champions women’s rights in her lyrics, specifically speaking out against the practice of female genital cutting, which she experienced as a child in Senegal. Today, she uses music to ensure that girls no longer have to endure the pain that was inflicted upon her as a youth. “I am just trying to speak for the many women who cannot raise their voices,” she said in an interview with The Guardian. “I feel that when I talk, one person listens; but when I sing, thousands of people can hear my song.” Also pictured is Deeb, an Egyptian musician who performed in Cairo’s Tahrir Square during the revolution. “Rise up, O Egyptian / No revolution can be terminated in a night and day,” he sings in the song “Promised.” “Bear with yourself a bit / Have endurance and tolerance / Don’t fear on the cycle of production / 
There should be a revolution against oneself / Tomorrow is better than the past.” Over 250 photographs make up “Forthright,” which are all compiled into a book disguised as an album booklet, complete with a selection of in-depth interviews and sample lyrics. Through the powerful publication, Kraus makes his purpose objectively clear: in today’s political climate, we don’t need more guns, more bombs, more war. We need words, we need music, we need the power of those individuals willing to risk their lives to speak their minds.  As written in the book itself: “Music is the language of our heart, so, we choose music as our weapon.” Purchase a copy for yourself here.  Every Friday, HuffPost’s Culture Shift newsletter helps you figure out which books you should read, art you should check out, movies you should watch and music should listen to.

ARTS & CULTURE,There’s A Reason Why Indie Bookstores Are Thriving,"At the tail end of last year, the New York book community was hit with unsettling news. BookCourt, the independently run store serving Carroll Gardens, Cobble Hill, Brooklyn Heights, and readers willing to venture from their own neighborhoods for the sake of author events and stocked shelves, was closing. For avid readers, the loss of a bookstore leaves a mark. Bookstores ― the brick-and-mortar variety ― foster so many chance encounters and reflective moments; true love of the glue-and-paper sort blossoms among their shelves. And, a shuttered indie doesn’t bode so well for the looming Bezospocalypse, even if their sales are increasing at a steadier-than-average clip compared with non-indie vendors.  But, like magic, the closing of BookCourt coincided with the announcement of another store, to be opened by Emma Straub, author of Modern Lovers, The Vacationers and Laura Lamont’s Life in Pictures. A onetime BookCourt employee and longtime lover of literature, Straub hopes her store will be “salve for the wound.” She and her husband are still ironing out the details of the lease for their store, Books Are Magic! But, she told The Huffington Post that they’re aiming for a May opening date. “I understand from all of my friends who own small businesses that things always take longer than you think they should,” Staub said. “But, we’ll see. The goal is May.” Below, Straub shares her earliest and happiest bookstore memories, and her and her husband’s plans for their future store. When did you decide to open Books Are Magic!? The second that we heard that BookCourt was closing. Which was mid-October. We found out earlier than most of the public in the neighborhood. Immediately, we thought, no, no, this can’t happen. We live a few blocks away from BookCourt, and we’re there, I would say, three or four times a week. I truly couldn’t fathom the notion that we would live in a neighborhood without an independent bookstore. We know ― oh, yeah, this is our job to fix. So, we’re working on it. In your announcement you highlight the importance of a bookstore to a community or neighborhood. How, in your experience, have bookstores played that role?  I work from home, and for me a bookstore is a place that I can always go. It’s a place I can go to find new ideas, and see old friends, and to read a poem, and to pick up a picture book for one of my children, and to buy a gift. Books are the only presents that always fit. I don’t think I’ve ever gotten a book and thought, oh, god, this is just, the wrong thing. Even when I don’t buy something, I always fondle a lot of things. As a writer, bookstores have been enormously important to me. BookCourt in particular, but also other independent bookstores across the country. There’s nothing like it. There’s nothing like a bookstore. It falls in a certain in-between space, between public space and private space. Bookstores always feel intimate but welcoming. I think they’re important and necessary for people like me who have small children, and where it’s not always warm outside. It’s nice to have a place to go. You’ve already touched on this, but what do you think physical bookstores offer that, say, an online bookstore doesn’t? Oh, discoverability. Discoverability, expertise. I think algorithms are great, and sometimes helpful when you’re buying something and it suggests that you also buy batteries or whatever, but it doesn’t really work with books. It really doesn’t. An algorithm is never going to replace a human being saying, “Oh, that’s interesting, you like Ann Patchett and Meg Wolitzer but you’ve never read Maile Meloy? Oh my god, you’re in for such a treat!” There are so many things like that that happen every day in every bookstore. Also, just the feeling of wandering. Actually, I have this problem a lot when it comes to music. I don’t listen to CDs anymore, because my husband is more technologically advanced than I am. He has his music very well organized, and on his cloud-whatever, but I no longer get to flip through my music to see what I have. I’ve forgotten what I like to listen to. I can’t remember anything if I can’t see it. And that’s how I feel about bookstores. When you walk through a bookstore, you’re reminded of things that you love, and you see a cover that looks amazing, of a book you’ve never heard of by a person you’ve never heard of, and you pick it up and you flip it over and you read what it’s about and maybe you buy it. And that doesn’t really happen online. You can’t just fall into something. You can’t pick a book off the shelf and read the first five pages of it and know that you’re going to fall in love. Or, you can’t pick up a book that everyone else has read and loved, and read the first page and know that it’s garbage and that you don’t want to read it. You worked at BookCourt. What do you hope to emulate about that store, with your store? And is there anything you’d like to change, or anything new you’d like to try? What’s most important to me is to have a space that feels open and welcoming, and comfortable. That’s the number-one thing. I think BookCourt did a really beautiful job for 35 years, and I hope to be half as good at it as they were. Luckily I have a lot of friends who run independent bookstores in New York City. In fact, everyone who runs a bookstore in New York City has been so friendly and encouraging to us about this. Christine Onorati, who owns WORD, is one of my dearest friends. Stephanie Valdez and Ezra at the Community Bookstore, Rebecca and Jessica at Greenlight, Maggie Pounzie at Story, a children’s bookstore. Sarah McNally. Every person has been encouraging, and offered their help and expertise. We really feel like we’re not trying to compete with anyone. We are truly just doing this to fill this hole in this neighborhood where we live, that has been served so beautifully by BookCourt for so long. We’re just trying to be a little salve for the wound.  Where did you come up with the store’s name, Books Are Magic!? We hadn’t really thought about names very much. We had a few that sounded more like a butcher shop. We were struggling a little bit. And then, we were talking about just doing a children’s bookstore. And I just thought, books are magic. Just, books are magic, that’s it, that’s the whole point. And we decided that books are magic for everyone, not just children. What’s your earliest bookstore memory? My earliest bookstore memory is from when I was about 10 years old, and I grew up on the Upper West Side in Manhattan where there used to be this wonderful independent bookstore called Endicot. And Matt Dillon was in the store when I was in the store, and I just followed him around. It was not a big place, and I was not a small 10-year-old, so I doubt I was very inconspicuous. So that’s my earliest bookstore memory, if I’m being 100 percent honest. So, it started with a dreamboat. Working at BookCourt was one of the best jobs I’ve ever had. I think what made it so fun for me was that I knew every day I went in there I was going to have conversations with smart, interesting people. That is, the other booksellers, the owners, and the customers. That’s what I really loved about it. There was always someone to talk to, and they always had something to say about a book. And what more would you want, really?

ARTS & CULTURE,Technology Allows Tattoo Artist To Really Get Cutting-Edge,"Technology and tattoos are coming together for a cutting-edge ink artist in Grand Junction, Colorado. At The Raw Canvas, Justin Nordine still applies tattoos to his clients’ bodies using an old-fashioned ink gun. But his designs are digital, thanks to his Apple Pencil and iPad Pro. “It has changed my reality as an artist. Tenfold,” Nordine told NBC News. “I hold the Pencil, and anything I do with it — I can turn it into a paintbrush, a marker, an actual pencil. An airbrush. Splatter paint. I mean, you name it. I literally have an entire bucket of tools in my pocket with one piece of technology.” Using the Pencil and iPad requires a different way of thinking for 36-year-old Nordine.  “I now can take my image and bounce it to my next iPad, so I have a visual while I’m tattooing,” he said. “I can zoom in on it if I want to to see the detail. I can change it in an instant.”"
ARTS & CULTURE,Nearly 700 'Nasty Women' Artists Have Teamed Up To Protest Trump,"”I thought we were headed on a different trajectory,” New York-based artist Roxanne Jackson sighed in an interview with The Huffington Post. “I just really didn’t anticipate ... this.” Jackson was referring to the events of Nov. 9, 2016, when Donald Trump was elected president of the United States.  In the days that followed, Jackson’s emotional state shifted from utter shock to a foggy depression as she struggled to come to terms with the fact that our nation’s foremost leader will soon be a man who has publicly objectified, demeaned, humiliated, threatened and bragged about assaulting women without recourse. A man with plans to defund Planned Parenthood, to “punish” women for having abortions and to rescind decades of progress toward gender equality.  Jackson was hardly alone in her feelings of disbelief, anger and fear. But she didn’t realize the extent of her support system until Nov. 14, 2016, when Jackson spontaneously posted a callout on Facebook. “Hello female artists/curators! Let’s organize a NASTY WOMEN group show!!! Who’s interested???” she wrote, tagging women artists, curators, and writers in her circle. Shortly after posting, Jackson went offline to spend a day at work teaching ceramics. Unknown to her at the time, the message went viral as nasty artist after nasty artist recruited other like-minded ladies for the cause. “I had no idea how much this would escalate and evolve,” Jackson said. Within the first hour of posting, she had 300 responses.  The reaction to Jackson’s idea was so enthusiastic and impassioned that the prospect of curating a neat and tidy exhibition, capped at a certain number of participants, no longer felt quite right. After discussing the burgeoning project with her co-organizer, curator Jessamyn Fiore, Jackson decided no nasty woman would be turned away or left behind. And thus, “The Nasty Women Art Exhibition,” a sprawling buffet of proudly rude, women-identifying artists, was born.  In part, Jackson’s idea was inspired by her experience protesting outside of Trump Tower after election weekend and the overwhelming catharsis of being enveloped in a throng of united people. Through her art show, more of a visual protest than a traditional exhibition, she hoped to further communicate to nasty women everywhere that they are not alone.  To do so, Jackson and her team, comprised of Jessamyn Fiore, Angel Bellaran, Barbara Smith, Haley Shaw, Young Sun Han, Clive Murphy, Carolina Wheat, Liz Nielsen, Stephanie Stockbridge, and Aimee Odum, invited women artists from all over the world to submit their work. The only requirement was that their piece measures under 12 inches in every direction (a simple limitation meant to help manage the large quantity of artworks coming in). No artist who offered work was denied inclusion, and as a result, the crew acquired approximately 1,000 pieces by the time submissions closed.  “The Nasty Women Art Show” will be on view at Queens’ Knockdown Center starting Jan. 12 ― just one week before inauguration day. The multidisciplinary pieces, sent in by a whopping 694 artists, will be suspended from 12-foot tall sculptures that will read “Nasty Women” in hot pink letters. Some artists in the show, Jackson explained, are well-established in the New York art scene, but most aren’t names you’d find on the usual gallery roster. Some hail from small towns in red states, others from outside the U.S. completely, and many have never exhibited work before.  The true force of the show, more than any singular name or piece, is the sheer amount of images on view and the solidarity that number represents. “This show isn’t necessarily about highlighting individual artists,” Jackson explained. “It’s about female-identifying artists coming together against the Trump regime.”  Another wonderfully anti-establishment element of the exhibition is that the works on view are priced at $100 or less, with all proceeds benefitting Planned Parenthood. Viewers, then, can come home with a $10 artwork or a $100 piece by an artist whose works usually bring in far more zeroes. Jackson described the show as “cash and carry,” meaning you won’t have to wait until the end of the exhibition to take your new, feminist masterpiece ― just make sure to bring some dollar bills. “Hopefully the show will just look like very naked letters at the end,” Jackson mused. It’s a strange time to be an artist in America. On the one hand, the urge to resist and express through creative means is stronger and more necessary than ever. And yet it’s easy for art to feel futile, insular and trivial amid dire political times. Jackson, whose ceramic sculptures often operate on the fringes of the feminine grotesque, found that, post-election, her glam-horror aesthetic was no longer so horrific. “I’ve been making these monsters, but they’re not dark enough, they’re not intense enough,” she said. “However scary a sculpture could look, it’s nothing compared to Trump in the White House. The reality is horrifying.” Yet rather than giving up on her craft, Jackson became more determined than ever to channel her skills into active resistance. For this reason, it was crucial to Jackson that the “Nasty Women” exhibition not just be “a group show of Bushwick artists,” as she put it, but an accessible visual protest that could reach beyond the borders usually ascribed to art happenings.  Along with the New York-based show, there are currently 23 other “Nasty Happenings” scheduled for the coming two months, taking place everywhere from Lubbock, Texas, to Brussels, Belgium. Jackson invites any and all other nasty women interested in getting involved to organize their own “Nasty Women” show, with instructions available on the show’s website. Her only request is that all shows adopting the “Nasty” name donate their proceeds to an organization benefiting women’s rights.   “I want this visual art protest to count,” Jackson said. “I want to inspire others, to continue to make art, to continue to march in protest, to resist as much as possible. This election has been a wake-up call. Our challenge is to not forget. We can’t just be defeated; we can’t just turn apathetic. We have to be active.”  “The Nasty Women Art Exhibition” will run from Jan. 12 through Jan. 15 at The Knockdown Center, Maspeth, Queens, NYC.

ARTS & CULTURE,Sleater-Kinney Just Made Bowie's 'Rebel Rebel' The Political Anthem Of 2017,"“Let’s kick some ass next year,” Sleater-Kinney drummer Janet Weiss shouted to a San Francisco crowd on New Year’s Eve. “We’ve got a lot of work to do!” Weiss then joined bandmates Corin Tucker and Carrie Brownstein, breaking into a rowdy rendition of the late David Bowie’s “Rebel Rebel.” Suddenly, the 1974 hit seemed made for 2017, giving us the political anthem we needed for a new year. Sleater-Kinney was joined by Spoon’s Britt Daniel and the Thermals’ Hutch Harris, who also sang lead vocals on the song. But Tucker truly stole the stage with her final verse. Beating her chest with her fist and pulling at her hair while belting Bowie’s iconic words, Tucker became a conduit for all the emotion buzzing around the end 2016. Hot tramps, the new year is upon us. Let’s channel Bowie’s badness and Sleater-Kinney’s fierceness with all our might, and charge fists first into 2017.  See the entire performance below: "
ARTS & CULTURE,The Best Technology For The New Year,"The greatest technology for a creative person is neither an app nor a device, it is paper. As we begin the new year, I wanted to share this analog system with you which I created called The Creativity Notebook, so that it can transform your world the way it has mine. As a working artist and mother, I am constantly searching for different methods to increase my productivity and to enhance my life. I love technology. I’m a longtime subscriber to Lifehacker, use Trello and I couldn’t function without Google Docs. But when it comes to capturing ideas, lists and making appointments on a device, I risk falling into the black hole of news, email or social updates that we all do. I tried and found every form of note-taking, list-tracking app a productivity killer and a time waster. An artist’s greatest asset is uninterrupted time. I had to invent a system that would give me more and enhance the creative process, not detract from it. There is no creativity without productivity. The connection between paper and creativity is well-documented. I tried other “analog” systems but found them overwrought. I needed something simple, inspiring and action-oriented all in one. As a painter, entrepreneur and founding arts editor of this online newspaper, it is essential that I stay organized. I started with a sketchbook and this is how The Creativity Notebook was born. The Creativity Notebook: The Front Half The first half of the Creativity Notebook is a simple Segregated Notes and Action Items section with thoughts/notes/sketches on the left and the action items on the right. When either side is full, migrate only the uncompleted tasks only to the righthand side of the next spread. The tactile experience of re-writing incomplete tasks reinforces their need to get done. This working method catapulted my productivity to a whole new level. People always ask me “When do you find the time?” This is how. The Creativity Notebook also becomes an incredible chronological file because, if somebody asks, “What was it that we discussed in that meeting months ago?” I only need to flip backwards to find the notes in my handy notebook. Incorporating a Datebook The back half of the Creativity Notebook is a 52 week calendar section. It involves a simple binder brass clip as a toggle and art by either me or you.  The binder clip is essential component.  By putting the datebook on the back, only past dates and future blank note pages are under the clip. All relevant notes and future dates are always accessible outside the clip. All I have to do is move the clip to the right and exactly on the current date. It is the perfect combination — a datebook, a notebook, a sketchbook and an idea book all in one. I experimented with every kind of paper notebook and found that certain subtleties make huge differences. Unlined/Uncoated Paper I want no borders to hem my ideas in so it had to be unlined. Furthermore, the texture of uncoated paper reunites me with a more primitive self and connects me to everyone who has ever held a writing instrument on parchment throughout time. It feels organic and real. The binding must not just lie flat but block out one side altogether. Creative Notebooks need to have the functionality that enables pure focus. Different Art for Every Week Because of our sensitivity to visual input, I created suggestive art that still has usable margins as a key feature. Just seeing a color, line, poem, quote or a shape of any kind differentiates each week. Associating different art with every week creates visual scaffolding and anchors the pleasure of planning. In the past, when I bought art-centric datebook from museum shops, I was limited to one artist’s work which I couldn’t write on, no margins to participate in with paper too smooth and too thick. Such books are also too heavy to carry around in order for it to function in lieu of a device. Unlike the Week-at-a-Glance system, where the week is spread across two pages, I needed a vertical structure stacked day structure with the morning activities under the sun and evening activities under the moon to make it easier to avoid over planning too many evenings in a row. Downtime is essential for creative minds.  This subtle difference made a huge impact on how I created uninterrupted time and a rhythms in my week.  One year I tried no art and two vertically structured weeks side by side and instead of making me more productive, the lack of art stressed me out and space for each week.  It only reinforced the need for art. I developed The Creativity Notebook over several years to heighten my productivity, inspire me creatively and as a tool to avoid reaching for my device all throughout the day. It has truly changed my life. I’m excited about presenting it to the public for the first time. Yes, it means that everywhere you go, you will carry around a notebook that has all your thoughts, drawings, tasks and calendar in one place. You already carry keys, a wallet and a piece of metal and glass that is known and scientifically-proven to yank you away from your thoughts. Based on the people who I have already given it to, I know you will treasure as it is your own work of art.   I am currently offering two editions which are handcrafted in my studio in Venice, California: Signed Limited Artist Edition of 100. Each book has a 52 week spread, Calendars for 2017–19 and approximately 50 spreads for the segregated note systems. All notebooks measure 5.5 x 8 inches, 120 plus pages.   I have been beta-testing it with numerous artists, writers and entrepreneurs in California and they all tell me how it has streamlined so much of what they do and they treasure it.  I would love to share this revolutionary new application with you. TheCreativityNotebook.com — - Kimberly Brooks is a painter.

ARTS & CULTURE,"Carrie Fisher's Books Were 'Wiped Out By Demand,' So They're Being Reprinted","Carrie Fisher died unexpectedly at the age of 60 on Dec. 27, 2016, but her legacy certainly lives on. The actress proved herself a prolific writer in her lifetime and, according to her publisher Simon & Schuster, her books have seen a massive uptick in sales since her death. President and publisher of Simon & Schuster Publishing Group Jonathan Karp told Entertainment Weekly that the publishing house is “quickly reprinting her books” to meet the overwhelming demand. “All of them have remained in print, but our supply was wiped out by demand. We’ll have more books this week,” Karp told EW. The publisher has ordered an additional 50,000 copies of Fisher’s titles, including her memoirs, Wishful Drinking and Shockaholic, and her novels, Postcards from the Edge and The Best Awful. Fisher’s latest memoir, The Princess Diarist, came out last year and, since her death, has climbed to the top of the Amazon’s best-sellers list. "
ARTS & CULTURE,New Book Defending Donald Trump Is Actually An Elaborate Prank,"Last week Mashable shared a look at a surprising new book meant to posit virtues of the U.S. president-elect.  Its title, Why Trump Deserves Trust, Respect & Admiration, is likely off-putting to those who don’t support the normalization of Donald Trump’s manners and mantras. And the book’s author, David King, would agree: His new release is filled with blank pages. “Despite years of research, we could not find anything to say on this subject, so please feel free to use this book for notes,” reads the book’s Amazon description. It’s a self-published prank that anti-Trumpers will appreciate ― and an example of how trolling can be harsh without using harsh language. In late 2016, vocal Trump supporters pulled some book-related stunts that seemed less satirical and more harmful, targeting individual writers instead of a public figure. In November, Fox News reporter Megyn Kelly accrued a number of one-star Amazon reviews on her book Settle for More. Suspiciously, the reviews focused not on the book itself but on choices she made as a debate moderator; once 76 percent of reviewers gave the book just one star, Amazon moved to delete the more nefarious ratings.  In September, a similar attempt was made to bring down the overall rating of Laura Silverman’s Girl Out of Water on Goodreads. Silverman, a Jewish writer who had expressed her political beliefs on Twitter, received a bevy of one-star reviews related to her opinions rather than her writing, before review copies of the book were even sent out. “She is literally worse than Hitler,” one reviewer wrote. The Amazon ratings on King’s book, on the other hand, are mixed, but uniformly civil. Those who enjoyed the prank took it a step further with puns and limericks; those who didn’t had quips of their own. It all shows that effective satire ― that is, humor that punches up ― can catalyze playful debate.  Why Trump Deserves Trust, Respect & Admiration is now available in paperback."
ARTS & CULTURE,Margaret Atwood Cautions America Against 'Dictators Of Any Kind',"Margaret Atwood knows about political tumult. Over 30 years ago, she wrote a classic book about a society’s quick slide into a woman-oppressing dystopia. The title remains relevant; The Handmaid’s Tale is getting adapted for a TV series next year, starring Elisabeth Moss (of “Mad Men” fame). As an activist and writer of wayward worlds, Atwood is uniquely qualified to comment on political developments. And what she has to say about America’s recent state of affairs is pretty grim.  In a brief letter in support of and distributed by PEN America, Atwood wrote: When dictators of any kind, in any country, achieve power, they clamp down on writers and journalists first, because writers and journalists are alternative and frequently dissenting voices.  The Canadian author continued, “America has always prided itself on being a country where the freedom to write is valued. Please support and preserve that value.” She also referenced a line from The Handmaid’s Tale, connecting it with today’s environment of fake news and “cyberbullying from the corridors of our power.” While Atwood doesn’t name names in her plea, her implication is clear: Donald Trump’s many attempts to discredit the media are more than bad omens. They’re deliberate steps toward limiting freedom of thought. Atwood isn’t the first to make this claim. In a post headlined “Trump Won. The Media Lost. What Next?” NPR writes that the president-elect “avidly campaigned against” journalists. And his win hasn’t halted his media-shaming tweets. The plot of The Handmaid’s Tale is set in 2005, after the spread of false information ― a staged terrorist attack ― leads to the speedy renunciation of the Constitution, and revocation of women’s rights. In her letter, Atwood makes it clear that she doesn’t view her story as a playful “what if” scenario, but a warning against a possible future.  Read our interview with Margaret Atwood. CORRECTION: A previous version of this article claimed that Margaret Atwood wrote The Handmaid’s Tale 20 years ago. However, Atwood wrote the book in 1985 ― making it over 30 years old."
ARTS & CULTURE,‘Sexually Explicit’ Books Could Be Under Fire In Virginia Schools,"Last week The Washington Post reported on a Virginia bill proposal that would force school districts to highlight which books on a given syllabus contain sensitive or “sexually explicit” material. “All local school boards would be required to set up a way for parents to opt out of objectionable materials; teachers would have to provide replacement texts for those who ask for them,” Washington Post writes. News of the bill proposal, reportedly being drafted and considered by the Virginia Board of Education, comes shortly after two classic novels were pulled from the bookshelves of Accomack County Public Schools in Virginia.  The proposal resembles a bill that the state’s governor vetoed last year. Nevertheless, its implications have educators and activists vocally worried. The chief concern: such a rule could prevent young readers from accessing stories of literary and educational merit. Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World, Toni Morrison’s The Bluest Eye, and Herman Hesse’s Siddhartha -- celebrated classics -- are among the many books that’ve been banned or challenged due to sexual content since 2014. And, in the past, books deemed “sexually explicit” have often been titles featuring queer characters or women asserting their sexual personhood. For access to be cut off to such stories could be damaging to kids who otherwise have no way of meeting fictional representations of their own experiences. According to the American Library Association, Peter Parnell and Justin Richardson’s And Tango Makes Three, a picture book about two male penguins raising a baby penguin, is regularly featured on the organization's annual list of most-challenged titles. If a progressive book (or, at least, an innocuous one) is regularly red-flagged, it seems that red-flagging could put any title -- classic or new and innovative -- at risk."

ARTS & CULTURE,Exploring The Shadowy World Of A Cuban Feminist Legend,"The Abakuá is an all-male, Afro-Cuban secret society that originated in Nigeria and gained traction in 19th-century Cuba, where African slaves would covertly participate in the mysterious rites and rituals as means of protection and forging community. Today, the mysterious Abakuá is the only prevalent secret society in Cuba. Through the centuries, one of the fundamental traditions of the brotherhood has remained constant: the secrets of the Abakuá must remain secret, at all costs.  The weight of this secrecy is palpable in the works of the late master printmaker Belkis Ayón, who made the Abakuá her primary subject matter. Throughout her career, the Afro-Cuban artist used the technique of collography to create sharp and unnerving representations of Abakuá folklore imbued with a feminist, intellectual edge. A retrospective of the artist’s works is on view now for the first time at a U.S. museum. As part of her unique process, Ayón collaged a variety of textured materials ― from soft paper to sandpaper to vegetable peelings ― onto a cardboard matrix, which she’d then cover with ink and run through a printing press. By layering a wide range of surfaces with different feels and absorbencies, Ayón could precisely control her ink ― whether it came out thick and velvety or delicate and scaly, yielding prints that resembled meticulously sketched drawings.  Ayón, who was born in Havana, Cuba, in 1967, became interested in the Abakuá and their mysterious traditions in 1985, when she was making art as a high school student. She was drawn, primarily, to the figure of Sikán, an African princess and the sole female character in Abakuá mythology.  According to legend, it was Sikán who originally discovered the magic of Abakuá, by accidentally trapping a fish who subsequently spoke to her in the mystical “voice” of Abakuá. Since women were banned from knowing the organization’s deepest secrets, Sikán was sworn to secrecy. The princess, however, gave in to temptation and divulged her forbidden knowledge to her fiancée; her life was sacrificed as a result.  In Abakuá lore, Sikán is killed for her transgressions. But in Ayón’s works, the figure is brought back to life, in part serving as a proxy for the artist herself. As Ayón put it: “I see myself as Sikán, in a certain way an observer, an intermediary and a revealer,” an exhibition statement from the Fowler Museum recounts her saying. “Sikán is a transgressor, and as such I see her, and I see myself.”   Like the princess, Ayón tests the limits of secrecy enshrouding the Abakuá, saturating her prints with graphic symbols and visual riddles ― sacred fish, roosters, goats, medallions, and snakes. The foreboding presence of silence bleeds through Ayón’s artistic style, in which humans appear as flattened figures in greyscale hues, endowed with large, expressive eyes and no mouths.  “These figures can look at you but cannot speak,” art historian Cristina Figueroa explained in an interview with NPR. “So you have to interpret what they’re trying to say through the expressions in their eyes.”  Furthermore, Ayón injects the all-male narrative of the Abakuá with feminine presence in her prints, accomplishing in art what could never manifest in real life. In “La cena (The Supper),” she riffs off the familiar image of The Last Supper, with Sikán replacing Jesus at the center of the table, and an assembly of lattice-laden shadow figures, also women, at her sides.  Together Sikán and Ayón challenged a realm of knowledge ordained solely for men, art serving as an alternative means of communication that rests on the power of the eyes, not the tongue.  Another, more sinister connection between Sikán and Ayón emerged on Sept. 11, 1999, when the artist shot herself with her father’s gun at just 32 years old. At the time of her death, Ayón was already a famed figure in the Cuban art world, having shown at the Venice Biennale in ‘93 and sold works to both MOCA and MoMA. For her loved ones, Ayón’s death was a complete and utter surprise, a mystery oddly akin to the shadowy scenarios that served as her subject matter.  Cuban police allegedly investigated the possibility that the Abakuá was behind Ayón’s death, perhaps for revealing some fraternal secret or disrespecting its boundaries, but later ruled that suspicion out. The artist’s death was deemed a suicide, a conclusion with which her family agrees. Still, a sense of uncertainty looms over the event; a riddle that will never be fully solved.  Following her death, Ayón’s family has worked tirelessly to preserve her oeuvre and share it with the world. Her sister gave up her career as a doctor to conserve the works, a challenge outside of a museum in Cuba’s humid atmosphere. It has long been a dream of Ayón’s family to see her work exhibited and celebrated around the world, making her first U.S. retrospective a truly momentous event.  “Nkame: A Retrospective of Cuban Printmaker Belkis Ayón” is organized by the Belkis Ayón Estate and Ayón Manso with the Fowler Museum in Los Angeles, guest-curated by Cristina Vives-Figueroa. The show, whose title translates to “greeting” and “praise” in the language of Abakuá, is divided into five parts, tracing the evolution of Ayón’s technique and career.  Recent strides in diplomatic relations between Cuba and the U.S. have enabled Ayón’s work to travel further than once seemed possible. “Here in Cuba, we always keep hope for everything,” the artist’s niece, Yadira Leyva Ayón, told The LA Times. “And we have hope that now, so many people will see Belkis’ work. It’s important for our culture and our family. She was a very outstanding artist and person. And this way, we keep her alive.”    “Nkame: A Retrospective of Cuban Printmaker Belkis Ayón” is on view at The Fowler Museum at UCLA until Feb. 12, 2017. "
ARTS & CULTURE,Critics Threaten Boycotts Of Simon & Schuster Over Milo Yiannopoulos Book Deal,"After Milo Yiannopoulos, former Twitter creep and current editor at the notorious alt-right news platform Breitbart that is favored by white nationalists, announced yesterday he’d signed a $250,000 book deal with Simon & Schuster’s conservative Threshold imprint, the backlash was immediate.  “YUCK AND BOO AND GROSS,” responded comedian Sarah Silverman on Twitter. Shannon Coulter, marketing specialist and founder of the Ivanka Trump boycott campaign #GrabYourWallet, tweeted, “[Simon & Schuster] are you concerned $250k book deal you gave Milo Yiannopoulos will read as condoning the racist harassment [Leslie Jones] endured?”  Soon, however, pushback against the publisher transitioned from simple outrage to calls for organized resistance. One literary journal announced a boycott on coverage in 2017: In response to this disgusting validation of hate, we will not cover a single @simonschuster book in 2017. https://t.co/NAJhTgdeyX An indie bookstore also tweeted that it would not be stocking Simon & Schuster titles thanks to the Yiannopoulos deal:  Sometimes it's a tough call for bookshops between respecting free speech and not promoting hate speech. Sometimes not. Byebye @simonschuster https://t.co/nxTFS34Y1b Some readers tweeted their agreement, noting that they couldn’t give their money to a publisher that supported Yiannopoulos’ message. Even Judd Apatow chimed in. Threshold, an imprint specifically tailored to conservative nonfiction, has published books such as Donald Trump’s Crippled America, but a boycott of Simon & Schuster would likely hit hardest the authors from other, more diverse imprints not directly associated with this dustup, given that liberal boycotters were unlikely at any point to buy books from the right-leaning line.  Writer and book publicist Kima Jones pointed out in a tweet that a broad boycott of the entire, diverse Simon & Schuster catalog would harm the careers of many writers of color, in the name of standing against white nationalism: Not reviewing black writers and writers of color with 2017 @simonschuster titles is going to dismantle white supremacy how? Writer Tanya Contois suggested specifically boycotting Threshold, while buying, reviewing and promoting books from the diverse Salaam imprint at Simon & Schuster. But a few creatives now unwillingly associated with Yiannopoulos are choosing to pressure the publisher instead, declaring they would rather sever their professional relationships with the company than be on the same payroll. Emmett Plant, a producer who worked on more than 20 “Star Trek” audiobooks for CBS/Paramount, tweeted that he’d produced his last for them. (Simon & Schuster is a division of CBS Corporation.) Simon and Schuster gave Milo a book deal. Cool. Who has two thumbs and will never produce Star Trek for them ever again? This guy. I'm out. Writer Danielle Henderson, whose memoir The Ugly Cry is slated for publication by Simon & Schuster in 2018, revealed in a series of tweets that she was so outraged by her publisher’s new author that she was prepared to walk away from the deal if necessary: I'm looking at my @simonschuster contract, and unfortunately there's no clause for ""what if we decide to publish a white nationalist"" But know this: i'm well aware of what hill I am willing to die on, and my morals and values are at the top of that list. I will happily go back to slinging coffee—I'm not afraid to stand for what I believe in, and I make a MEAN cappuccino foam She also pointed out that the publisher had fought hard to win her book, which has been optioned, and that they offered her a larger contract than Yiannopoulos. This likely gives her more clout, and more options, than many other authors at Simon & Schuster, though more established authors at the publisher have remained silent as of yet. Is silence actually the best response? Lisa Lucas, executive director of the National Book Foundation, seems to think so: Outrage helps sell books. Utter silence is what kills them. In a post-Trump election era, however, many on the left must be wondering where the line between a chilling silence and the silence of tacit acceptance falls."
ARTS & CULTURE,11 Things We Learned From Women In Film This Year,"On the whole, 2016 was not an easy year for women. America’s president-elect became a president-elect after footage was released of him saying, “I’m automatically attracted to beautiful women — I just start kissing them [...] I don’t even wait. And when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.”  In filmmaking, gender parity developments weren’t as bleak. In January, The New York Times reported an uptick in films directed by women; in 2015, nine percent of top-grossing films had women at the helm, a two percent increase from the previous year. It’s small, but it’s something. No one ever said progress would come in floods, or even a steady stream.  Behind this progress, there’s a fleet of vocal screenwriters, directors, producers and actresses ― some of whom speak up because they’re constantly barraged with gender-related questions, others because parity is a focal point of their work. We talked with several of them this year, ranging from household names like Sally Field to directors toiling away at short filmmaking, hoping to secure feature-length funding.  Below is a sampling of takeaways on how to achieve gender equality in the film industry, culled from some of our favorite 2016 interviews and profiles. “Hugh Grant can get away with it. And ‘High Fidelity,’ I mean, John Cusack’s character is a mess, but you love him. You love him. I feel like, you know, that’s another way that gender equality needs to come in. We need to allow women characters to have all facets. To be flawed, to be wonderful, to be frustrating, to be inspiring. Because we are all those things. Period.” Read more here.   “We’re all connected. We need allies, period. We’re the minority. It’s not something I look at as a weakness, or like we should play victims. It is simply highlighting our collective voices and saying that it’s important to highlight the stories of these nuanced individuals so that when we’re out in the real world and we come across someone that feels familiar, that feels like the character you saw on TV, you think differently on how you treat them. We deserve to have the same opportunities, the same respect as any other person in society.” Read more here. “Not every man who directs a movie about the mafia is himself in the mafia. That means that women might be able to direct films that don’t directly line up with their realm of experience. It’s almost like a quota mentality. I think this goes for women and minorities both. [Movie executives] say, ‘We really want a woman to direct this movie.’ The minute you say that, you mean that we’re all the same. Any woman could direct this movie, and it doesn’t matter which one?” Read more here. “Listen, it’s always been difficult for women. That’s nothing new. You could look at the statistics in ’79 or ’80, when I did ‘Norma Rae.’ It’s always been difficult for women — that is just the way it is. It’s a good thing that people are standing up and hollering now. It isn’t just women now standing up and hollering, and I think if it were just women, we would be silenced again, as usual.” Read more here.  “Most shorts are financed independently so short filmmakers don’t have to ask permission to cast actors of color or older actors. Women directors don’t have to wait for a studio to hire them to get a chance behind the camera.” Read more here. “I probably have the same kind of past as a Julianne Moore or a Sigourney Weaver or any of them, but they far surpassed me in terms of their opportunity. And that’s the difference. Your work and what you invest in your talent doesn’t match the opportunity of the narratives that are out there. So you have to take all that you have and pour it into [playing] the detective in ‘Disturbia.’” Read more here.  “It’s so funny the things you say inside of a sisterhood. ‘Who has one boob that’s bigger than the other? Your ass is fatter.’ There’s all that ping-ponging that’s very prevalent. It’s part of my intimate experience.” Read more here. “There’s been a lot of talk in the last year or two about more roles for women, but I think that it really starts at getting more women in positions to hire women and make movies about women and to cast women in movies. So yes, having more women behind the camera is just as, if not more, important than still continuing to try and make more roles for women in Hollywood, in television and in film. And I’m excited to be a part of that.”  Read more here. “I love genre, in all its forms — Western, horror, noir, sci-fi. That’s my passion. And as a filmgoer I always resisted the idea of “women films” — or “men films,” for that matter. I think it is important to embrace women that don’t subscribe to those clichés. The idea that a woman director has, by definition, less affinity for an action scene than a male one is silly. Kathryn Bigelow can out-direct most of her male colleagues in Hollywood. It’s a matter of vision, talent, stylistic and poetic inclinations. Not gender.” Read more here. “It’s like giving birth to a new prototype of a woman. Of course it’s a fiction character and it’s certainly not someone you would meet walking in the subway, meaning it’s not a completely realistic character. But it’s a very, very special character. Even in fiction, you’ve never seen someone like her.” Read more here. “I wanted to make a film that wasn’t about a superhero, or a physically powerful woman, but just an ordinary woman with a fire inside her.

ARTS & CULTURE,WTF: Milo Yiannopoulos Inks Book Deal With Simon & Schuster,"Ex-Twitter bully Milo Yiannopoulos may have been taken offline, but now he’ll be in print.  The “alt-right” editor at Breitbart News just signed a $250,000 book deal with Threshold Editions, an imprint of Simon & Schuster, as per an exclusive from The Hollywood Reporter.  Threshold Editions told The Huffington Post in an email that the book will be called Dangerous and is set to be released on March 14, 2017. The imprint summarized the book by stating: DANGEROUS will be a book on free speech by the outspoken and controversial gay British writer and editor at Breitbart News who describes himself as “the most fabulous supervillain on the internet.”    “They said banning me from Twitter would finish me off. Just as I predicted, the opposite has happened,” Yiannopoulos told THR. “Did it hurt Madonna being banned from MTV in the 1990s? Did all that negative press hurt Donald Trump’s chances of winning the election?” Are you irritated yet? Because if you are, you’re not alone. Twitter has been in an uproar since the news broke. The irony of this, of course, is that Yiannopoulos was banned from Twitter after orchestrating a widespread, pernicious attack against “Ghostbusters” actress Leslie Jones. Here are some of the choice enraged tweets: .@simonschuster are you concerned $250k book deal you gave Milo Yiannopoulos will read as condoning the racist harassment @Lesdoggg endured? If @simonschuster doesn't rescind misogynist troll Milo Yiannopoulos' $250K deal, I will sadly never purchase another S&S product again. @THR It was not a ""spat"" Thousands of people harassed/insulted/threatened the life of Leslie Jones. Stop normalizing white supremacy! @simonschuster Giving Milo Yiannopoulos a book deal means not one penny from me until the end of time. You support Nazis, you get nothing. How is it that I wake up, check Twitter, and see Amanda Palmer AND Milo Yiannopoulos are trending, and it's NOT  because either are dead? For what it’s worth, the Threshold imprint’s tagline is “Celebrating 10 Years of Being Right!” They’ve published works from the likes of Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh, Karl Rove, and President-elect Donald Trump. Of the partnership with the imprint, Yiannopoulos told THR that he “met with top execs at Simon & Schuster earlier in the year and spent half an hour trying to shock them with lewd jokes and outrageous opinions.” “I thought they were going to have me escorted from the building,” he added, “but instead they offered me a wheelbarrow full of money.” The 33-year-old has been responsible for incendiary headlines on Breitbart like “Science Proves It: Fat-Shaming Works” and “Birth Control Makes Women Unattractive and Crazy.” Well, 2017, you’re already looking terrible in our book."
ARTS & CULTURE,George R.R. Martin Accurately Summarizes 2016: 'Let This Wretched Year Come To An End',"“Death, death, and more death,” George R.R. Martin wrote in a blog post on Tuesday, pretty precisely capturing the downs, downs, and more downs of 2016. “This year just keeps getting worse and worse.” By worse, he means that just when we thought 2016 had taken as many great lives as it could ― David Bowie, Prince, Harper Lee, Alan Rickman, Muhammad Ali, Gene Wilder, George Michael, among so many others ― it took another. Carrie Fisher, the author and actress known widely for playing Princess Leia Organa in “Star Wars,” died on Tuesday after suffering a heart attack last week. “There is not much I can say about the death of Carrie Fisher that a thousand other people have not said already,” Martin wrote on his LiveJournal. “She was way too young. A bright, beautiful, talented actress, and a strong, witty, outspoken woman. Princess Leia will live as long as ‘STAR WARS’ [sic] does ... probably forever ...” Martin titled his blog post “A Bad Year Gets Worse,” under which he cited not only his location (Santa Fe) but his mood (sad, modified by a crying alien emoji). Besides commenting on the tragic death of Fisher, Martin also paid tribute to Richard Adams, the author of Watership Down, who died at the age of 96 this week. “A wonderful actress, a great writer,” Martin wrote of the two icons. “The world is poorer tonight.” “Please,” he added, “let this wretched year come to an end.” Earlier this year, when the world naively believed it had witnessed the apex of 2016’s misery, Martin offered the internet one of the most concise responses to the election of Donald Trump as president: “Winter is coming,” he wrote on the same LiveJournal. “I told you so.” You did, George. You did."
ARTS & CULTURE,'Watership Down' Author Richard Adams Dead At 96,"LONDON, Dec 27 (Reuters) - British novelist Richard Adams, the author of “Watership Down,” which sold millions of copies and captivated a generation of children, has died aged 96, his family said. The tale of brave rabbits searching for safety when their warren is threatened was at first rejected by major publishers. But the adventures of Hazel and Fiver went on to become a best-seller and the book is now considered a classic. It was also made into a hugely successful animated film and won the Carnegie Medal and Guardian Children’s Fiction Award. Adams, a self-confessed countryside-loving man, was a civil servant who left government after realizing the city was not for him. “Watership Down” was created, he told Britain’s Telegraph newspaper in 2014, out of a desire to be a constant parental presence, telling his daughters the rabbit stories on the way to school. “I’ve got a thing about that. Parents ought to spend a lot of time in their children’s company. A lot of them don’t, you know,” he said. He wrote many other novels about his childhood and youth, as well as about a period serving in the army in wartime. Adams also wrote a sequel to Watership Down, the name of hill in the north of Hampshire, near where he grew up in the English countryside."
ARTS & CULTURE,Obama’s Next Chapter: Write A New Book,"This week, the LA Times wrote up an interview President Obama gave with CNN’s David Axelrod, detailing the end of his two-term presidency and his plans for the future.  What’s up next for the Obamas? In addition to rumors that the president hopes to launch his own digital media company, he told CNN that he’s going to take Michelle on a nice, deserved vacation. And after that: “I’m gonna start thinking about the first book I ― I want to write.”  By first book, Obama doesn’t mean a first book, but rather a first post-presidency tome. He’s already written a memoir, something of a political credo, and a children’s book dedicated to his daughters, detailing the lives of altruistic Americans. Now, he’ll follow in the footsteps of past presidents by publishing after leaving the White House.  The New York Times wrote in September that such a title could rack up a deal in the tens of millions, easily financing the family’s next home.  Of course, the choice wouldn’t be purely economic. Obama’s interest in literature was clear from the outset of his presidency, and was only further solidified in the eyes of bibliophiles when he interviewed writer’s writer Marilynne Robinson about gun control, religion and community. (Plus, his favorite book of last year was Fates and Furies by Lauren Groff.) Perhaps a tentative multi-book deal will reflect his literary interests; regardless, any political insights he’s willing to dispel will be appreciated in coming years."
ARTS & CULTURE,What Comes Next? Rockwell Reminds Us,"People think they know Norman Rockwell, and they look for what they expect of him. But so often he presented an image that defied their expectations. He wouldn’t settle for the easy solution, the usual story line. That is why he loved to hear people’s stories of their lives, their struggles, the comic moments of relief and surprise in the midst of the drama. He searched for what was real in the illusionary world of illustration and sought a synthesis of those two disparate realities. “Party’s Over” appeared on the cover of The Saturday Evening Post on December 29, 1945 — almost four months after the long, drawn-out WWII ended, leaving an enervated nation staring into an unknown future. And with just the back of a lone waiter, Rockwell reveals so much. Instead of the predictable exhausted revelry of a group of partiers, my grandfather chooses the solitary image of one man with a small build, his shoulders somewhat collapsed in a dejected feeling about the task at hand — to clean up after the others have had their champagne, their dancing, their fill. He is separate from all the trimmings of celebration — the ribbons, hats, confetti, yet he is covered with the remnants of the night. Strangely, all the glasses and bottles of champagne and liquor are already gone, removed. He appears to be in a state ballroom or banquet hall, the regal gold curtains present a rigid, formal atmosphere in contrast to the reminders of the party’s chaos, frivolity, and perhaps rule breaking. The waiter, in his catering attire, his two-button jacket with tails, is having none of it — he has a job to do and he will do it, albeit somewhat reluctantly, the tray languishes at his side with his own stark, grey shadow reflected in it. The mirrored effect of another banquet hall adjoining this one and the light of day beckoning on the other side play with the idea of a light at the end of a tunnel. The candle lamps on the table still burn brightly. Rockwell changes his signature to suit the occasion and image, as he often did; his name runs at the bottom of the canvas — almost unnoticed — mimicking the confetti ribbons above. Of all the myriad images Pop could have chosen at the close of that tumultuous year, 1945, why did he choose this one of dejection, lethargy and solitude — of facing an unknown future without much joy, just focused on the job that needed to be attended to? That was much the state of America at that time. World War II had taken a great toll — physically, emotionally and psychically — on the American people and everyone around the world. What comes next? the country and the world unconsciously seemed to be asking. We were in uncharted territory without a map or a guide. Film Noir, that darkened period of edgy Hollywood and world cinema that arrived in the early 40’s and matured after the War, appeared on screen out of this feeling of uncertainty and the cruelty of an unknown fate — the femme fatale — that seemed beyond our control. Except we are a nation that was built on a strong and lasting vision. A vision that was born out of great difficulty and carnage — we are still a young country in comparison to the rest of the world — but a powerful vision that remains within us inherently without our prompting. And that is the continuing vision that Norman Rockwell was often able to capture in his almost 60 years as an illustrator, as our nation began to grow up, stumble, fall back, and pick itself up again and again with renewed vision and vigor. This is who we were and who we are and will always be. A nation that will aspire, achieve, overstep, make errors, rectify itself, and begin again stronger and hopefully wiser. That is our essence as a nation. And it is the essence of Pop’s vision of America and its continuing progress technologically, emotionally and spiritually. We can’t have the peace on earth we are seeking right now. Yet we can begin to find that peace within ourselves, our lives, and the life around us. That is how we regrow and expand the original vision for this country and our world. Nothing can happen without that profound and powerful vision. And we need to hold fast to that always evolving dream, now more than ever. Our faith is not tested in periods of prosperity and pockets of time spent in blissful serenity. Our faith is made real in times of crisis, unknowing and disquiet. Those are the moments that reveal who we truly are, not who we hope to be or wish we were. May 2017 be the year that marks the beginning of the great healing for our nation and the world, a year when even the smallest wishes peek through to see the light of day. Sometimes true healing only comes after the greatest crisis point is reached. That is why people continue to be drawn to the affirmative message of Rockwell. We know it is possible. And till our last breath we will breathe and live that truth with determination and grit because that is who we know we are and are struggling to become. Warmest wishes for a bright New Year, in spite of everything. Abigail P.S. I chose this Google image of the actual Post cover with a worn address card affixed. I love the destroyed Post signage and tattered edges. Yet the quality of the reproduction is surprisingly lucid and un-degraded."
ARTS & CULTURE,"The Invaluable Lessons Of 'Watership Down,' A Dark Classic Every Kid Should Read","“I do not believe in talking down to children,” Richard Adams explained in an interview with The Guardian last year. This, coming from an author widely known for writing the most violent “talking rabbit book” in history, is an understatement. Watership Down, his 1972 adventure novel, is not only what happens when a writer refuses to talk down to children. It’s what happens when a writer refuses on all counts to shelter kids from the brutal, melancholy realities of our nonfictional world. It’s what happens when a writer decides to give his young readers an obvious, but invaluable lesson: loss, obstacles and chaos, whether we choose them or not, are part of life. Adams, who died on Tuesday at the age of 96, has recounted the birth of Watership Down many times. In the late 1960s, he ― then a civil servant in the U.K. who’d never written fiction in his life ― would entertain his two daughters on the way to school by telling them stories that revolved around a particularly troubled warren of rabbits. “Once there were two rabbits called Hazel and Fiver,” he’d begin, telling tales captivating in their darkness, involving poison, snares and attack dogs. Eventually, encouraged by his daughters, Adams put pen to paper and submitted a surprisingly vicious and rabbit-filled manuscript to publishers. Rejected seven times (”They felt the language was too grown up,” Adams explained in a Reddit AMA, “yet the older children wouldn’t like it because it was about rabbits!”), it was finally accepted by Rex Collings, the tiny and summarily lucky publishing house that would go on to see the book sell in the millions. Hazel and Fiver are names that pique the ears of those who’ve navigated through Adams’ award-winning, 400-plus-page book. Brothers, they lived in a bucolic landscape meant to mimic the Berkshire Downs of Adams’ childhood. Spurred on by an apocalyptic vision Fiver has, they, along with a small group of other rabbits, decide to leave their vulnerable home in search of a new one. The Odyssean journey is neither smooth nor assuring. The distinct characters, so carefully anthropomorphized, are never blindly valiant as a result. A particularly jarring passage of Watership Down describes the pure fear and anxiety Fiver experiences after involuntarily parting ways with his brother Hazel halfway through the book. In the burrow, Fiver slept and woke uneasily through the heat of the day, fidgeting and scratching as the last traces of moisture dried out of the earth above him. Once, when a trickle of powdery soil fell from the roof, he leaped out of sleep and was in the mouth of the run before he came to himself and returned to where he had been lying. Each time he woke, he remembered the loss of Hazel and suffered once more the knowledge that had pierced him as the shadowy, limping rabbit disappeared in the first light of morning on the down. Because of its subject matter (talking rabbits), and perhaps the fact that many first encounter Adams on a high school reading list, some fans might classify Watership Down as a children’s book. Adams shrugs off the label entirely. “I don’t believe there should be such a thing as a children’s book,” he explained during a Reddit AMA. “A book is a book is a book,” he supposes in other interviews.  In 1974, New York Times critic Richard Gilman directly questioned the intended audience of Adams’ book, claiming, “I can’t imagine many readers under 13 or 14, an age when the lines between juvenile and adult fiction begin to blur, having the patience and grasp of extended allegorical strategies to persevere to the end of a 426‐page epic about a community of rabbits.” Gilman’s lack of faith in the reading comprehension of teenagers aside, his criticism missed the point. Kids on the precipice of adulthood should be encouraged to read books like Watership Down whether they have the patience for it or not. Humanity wrought through the eyes of bunnies is exactly the kind of fantasy readers under 13 or 14 should be exposed to. The kind of twisted, alien plot that sits in our heads for decades, becoming brighter and more poignant as you age and better empathize with moments like Fiver’s. The kind of book that unravels slowly, painfully, to reveal a story so realistic it’s easy to forget you’re dealing with talking rabbits and make-believe. “Readers like to be upset, excited and bowled over,” Adams continued in his 2015 interview with The Guardian, remembering his early literary preferences. “I can remember weeping when I was little at upsetting things that were read to me, but fortunately my mother and father were wise enough to keep going.” Of course, not all mothers and fathers are. Many want to shade their kids from the harsh realities of life, a natural instinct hardly worth criticizing here. Some children come face to face with loss regardless ― be it physical, financial, psychological. They are forced to understand grief and resentment firsthand. They are forced to understand that hard work and persistence and focused belief don’t always yield epic outcomes. But others, nestled safely, are not. Fiction, thankfully, can give us the gift of empathy. The kind of empathy your protective parents might not be able to impart. Adams, though a parent himself, aware of the fear his stories instilled in his own daughters, remains cooly detached from Watership Down readers. Through his writing, he’s not attempting to provide solace or security. He’s attempting to forge stories that, like the kind he read in his youth (by Edgar Allan Poe, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Algernon Blackwood), made him feel sad and frightened. That familiarized him with the cold, cloying feeling of worry. Why? Well, Adams, so unaware that he was crafting a classic when he first started sharing stories of Hazel and Fiver, answers the question early on in his book. To come to the end of a time of anxiety and fear! To feel the cloud that hung over us lift and disperse ― that cloud that dulled the heart and made happiness no more than a memory! This at least is one joy that must have been known by almost every living creature. "
ARTS & CULTURE,Let Emma Watson's Year In Books Inspire Your 2017 Reading List,"When you consider the series that made her a household name, it’s not that shocking to note that Emma Watson is quite literary. This year, the British actress released her 2016 reading list on Goodreads for all of us to enjoy. Over the course of the past 366 days, the former “Harry Potter” star has read her way through at least 39 books, the genres of which range from fiction to nonfiction to memoir to criticism. If her short films or political advocacy didn’t already make her an icon, then her preferences for feminist literature surely will."

But if perchance you have yet to see this video of a young Bjork reading the nativity story aloud on Icelandic television ― you might just have to reconsider.   The video was originally shot in 1977 and uploaded to Reddit in 2014, where it has remained on the minds of grumpy internet users desperate for a break from Christmas family fun ever since. In it, an 11-year-old Bjork looking unbelievably adorable and predictably cool tells the story of Jesus’ birth while a kids’ orchestra from the Reykjavík Children’s Music School plays in the background.  I mean, just look at this face.  Just five years later, Bjork would be fronting a punk band wearing face paint and a bow in her hair. And a mere 35 years after that, Bjork would be using her role as one of music’s most influential living legends to call out sexism in the industry. Once a renegade visionary, always a renegade visionary. Happy holidays to everyone ― but especially to Bjork. "
ARTS & CULTURE,Yiyun Li: 'To Be Orphaned From My Native Language Felt … Like A Crucial Decision',"Launching a career as a novelist seems like an impossible dream to many ― let alone doing so in a second or third language. But that’s exactly what Yiyun Li did after she graduated from college, moving from Beijing to the U.S. to study immunology at the University of Iowa; once there, she wound up honing her fiction-writing skills at the prestigious Iowa Writers’ Workshop.  In a poignant essay for The New Yorker, Li, now the acclaimed author of several novels and short story collections written entirely in English, meditates on what leaving Chinese behind and embracing a new language has meant for her: Over the years, my brain has banished Chinese. I dream in English. I talk to myself in English. And memories—not only those about America but also those about China; not only those carried with me but also those archived with the wish to forget—are sorted in English. To be orphaned from my native language felt, and still feels, like a crucial decision. Li writes that although she grew up in China, she’s only written professionally in English ― a fact that has caused some surprise and confusion. Though she notes it would be easy to assume that she left her home language for political reasons, as Vladimir Nabokov famously did, she delves into the thicket of personal history and emotional turmoil that motivated her. “Like all intimacies, the intimacy between one and one’s mother tongue can be comforting and irreplaceable,” she writes, “yet it can also demand more than what one is willing to give, or more than one is capable of giving.”  In delicately unraveling her own tangled relationship with the words she chooses to speak and write, Li sheds light on that most human of all relationships: that between oneself and one’s language. You can, and should, read Yiyun Li’s full essay at The New Yorker."
ARTS & CULTURE,"John Williams Has Never Seen 'Star Wars,' Doesn't Think Much Of His Scores","Some musical compositions were simply destined to live forever in the cultural conversation: Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony. The “Happy Birthday” song. Beyoncé’s entire catalog. And, of course, composer John Williams’ score to the “Star Wars” films, which are just as iconic and recognizable as that opening prelude scroll into outer space.  At least one person, however, doesn’t agree with that conclusion: Williams himself, who told The Mirror that he doesn’t find the “Star Wars” theme orchestrations to be particularly noteworthy. “A lot of them ​are ​not very memorable,” he said. “I’m a composer of music,” he explained, “and I look at Mozart and I look at Beethoven and Bach, the greatest organizers of sound that we’ve ever had, and you need to be humble when the shoulders that we stand on are so great.​“ Not to mention that Williams himself has also composed ― aside from non-film symphonies and concertos ― a number of other memorable scores, including those for “Jaws,” “E.T.,” “Schindler’s List,” and the first three “Harry Potter” movies. That’s some stiff competition within his own oeuvre. Perhaps more surprising is that, after spending months or more meticulously crafting and conducting orchestral compositions for these films, he admitted that he’s never actually seen the finished products. “I’m not particularly proud of that,” he told The Mirror. “”When I’m finished with a film, I’ve been living with it, we’ve been dubbing it, recording to it, and so on. You walk out of the studio and, ‘Ah, it’s finished.’” Then it’s time to move on to the next project. The always-prolific Williams hasn’t slowed down at 83; after scoring “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” last year, he has begun work on a new Steven Spielberg project. H/T AV Club"

Read Episode Thirty-Four: Finished!. Or, start at the beginning: An Illness's Introduction. Find all episodes here. After the thrill of seeing Hadley's murals on the walls of the Montana State Capital building, coming home to my novel that was growing roots in a file on my laptop was hard. The disappointment I felt in myself was directly proportional to the admiration I felt for Hadley. It was impossible not to compare our trajectories. Hadley, plagued as she'd been with serious health issues all her life, had turned out many notable projects in her 38 years, culminating in a historic, grand-scale commission. Here I was, on the verge of 60, and I hadn't managed to get Dream House, the project that most mattered to me, out into the world. I'd witnessed Hadley's deep satisfaction, unveiling the strongest and most celebrated work of her life. I wanted that! The week following my trip to Montana, I attended a rousing orchestral performance. I found myself imagining a violinist playing her instrument in her room for years on end with no clear prospect of ever being heard. An absurd notion, as music is meant to be listened to. We don't think of writing as a performing art. But like musicians, writers work assiduoaulsy to craft an affecting expression of their ideas and stories in order to touch an audience with their words. Writers, I glumly mused as the orchestra played on, can write for years without having their work read. Away doom and gloom! I couldn't let my discouragement quash my determination. I began making inquiries about self-publishing. I had no well-considered bias against this route to publication; I just didn't feel I had the stamina it takes to make it happen. No sooner had I begun my research, than an email popped up that made my heart gallop. Jay, my Dream House editor, had a colleague who was interested in publishing the book. It was tempting to get carried away by the excitement of this news. But I didn't share it even with my husband, Lewis, because the only thing worse than riding the rollercoaster of publication hopefulness that had begun four years earlier was taking those closest to me along for the ride. Two weeks after Hadley's mural unveiling, in a state of suspended belief, I drove downtown to meet with Lisa McGuinness, publisher at Yellow Pear Press. We hit it off and right then and there, nailed down details and deadlines to meet for publishing in the fall, November 2015.  Within eight weeks of my meeting with Lisa, my novel had a cover and I was proofreading the galleys. Every week, I let the new reality sink in a little more, but I still felt unable to celebrate. In part, this was because publishing had been a dream for so long that it felt too good to be true. Also, with many hands involved in its production, I fretted about whether the physical book would have the qualities I hoped for. And then there was the obvious: apprehension about how the novel would be received. Another reason I felt excitement bubbling up only at discreet moments was not related to anxieties about my novel, but rather, what was happening in my day-to-day, i.e., life, which goes on despite the alternate realities our work sometimes constructs for us. Sylvia, after a short remission, was not winning her fight with cancer. The July ablation she'd had on the small lesion on her liver appeared to trigger an inflammatory response, resulting in a new proliferation of cancer cells. By February, she was housebound, except when she needed to see her doctor, and was spending much of her days sleeping. One Saturday evening in mid-March, the water heater on the second floor of her house began leaking through the floor. The plumber who came on Monday used a blowtorch too close to a fire sprinkler in the water heater closet, setting off a monsoon in the house. Sylvia's daughter, Meredith, home at the time, called 911 and me. Then, she led her bathrobed mother down into the street and helped her and their dog into their parked car. When I arrived, there was mayhem: two fire trucks, water everywhere, my stunned, sliver of a friend sitting in the car out front. I drove her to my house and set her up in bed. Sylvia, her husband Peter, Meredith, and their Golden Retriever stayed with us for a week while their house dried out. It was profoundly affecting to witness the tender, complicated care Peter and Meredith gave Sylvia, and to have one of my dearest friends under my roof at the end of her life. When she was sleeping, I tried to carry on with the daily tasks that were moving my book forward, but my awareness of Sylvia's ephemerality kept me in the present moment. I didn't want to miss something important. I savored the times she asked me to help shift her tiny frame in the bed, each brief conversation we shared. ""I don't want to keep going like this,"" she told me one day. We talked about what's within a patient's power when they are ready to stop suffering and say goodbye. What could be more important, and yet how many times in life do we get the chance to talk this way with someone we love? One morning when we were chatting, she looked deep in thought for a few moments and I braced myself for something difficult. Finally, she said, ""I probably won't be able to eat it, but just in case, can you save me some of the Bolognese sauce you made for dinner?"" She laughed. She was such a foodie. She'd been eating Gerber baby arrowroot biscuits, mashed potatoes and ground chicken for days; no wonder she craved some zest! That week, I barely thought about Parkinson's, which felt like a mere annoyance. But I thought a lot about what awaits me and everyone close to me at the end of our lives. During Sylvia's stay, I talked to Hadley and she recalled her last days with her stepfather, Charlie. Our conversation about dying was disorienting, as if I were looking through a camera lens at the four of us -- Hadley, Sylvia, Charlie, and myself -- trying to adjust the focal length to correspond with our (unspoken) perceptions of where we were on the timelines of our lives. In late March, I sat on Sylvia's bed in the bright California sunshine streaming through the windows. She was waifish, every bone explicit. Always meticulously groomed, she worried aloud about how long her fingernails had grown and I asked her if she'd like me to cut them. Sylvia was a private person, and I felt honored when she said yes. As I held each of her cool, delicate fingers in my hand and clipped, I took my time, relishing the intimacy of this simple task, taking it in as Sylvia's last gift to me. She died several days later with Peter and Meredith by her side. Winter and spring were a blur of proofreading the Dream House galleys -- every word and punctuation mark, six times (by the time the book went to print, I probably could've told you to pick a word, any word, and I would've been able to turn to the page where it was written)--and pulling together promotional material at the behest of the publicist. Among other things, this included setting up an author Facebook page and a website, which I was lucky enough to have our son, Tobias, design. I learned how to describe the book in as few, hopefully enticing, phrases as possible: ""An architect of houses searching for home,"" ""...how we shape and are shaped by our houses,"" ""What makes a house feel like home?"" As tedious as the production period was at times, after years of editing Dream House with nothing but hope and encouragement to keep me motivated, I gobbled up the tasks before me, knowing that there would be a monumental payoff. Finally, I was able to put to bed all my sad feelings that are best described by the old question, ""If a tree falls in a forest and no one is there to hear it, does it make a sound?"" In July, Lisa met me for lunch to present my printed book. When she passed it across the table, I was unprepared for the emotional rush that sent me diving for my napkin to brush away tears. To me, the book was an exquisite object. The quiet but evocative jacket featuring an image of the Maine house where I was raised perfectly captures the tone and landscape of the novel; the size and weight of the book is modest but inviting. I hadn't dared to hope the physical embodiment of my story and the story itself, in which I explored everything that most moved me: space and architecture, love and motherhood, pain and healing, ocean, sky and trees, would be so well integrated, so...right. A week before the book's publishing date, in late October 2015, we threw a party. I dubbed it the ""If not now, when?"" party. I'd been casting about for an excuse to have a very big party for years and a book event seemed more fun than waiting for a milestone birthday, which, especially when you have a progressive, degenerative disease, is not necessarily a cause for celebration. The party was a blast. Local friends and my neurologist came. Friends from the other coast as well as our daughter Elena, my sisters, their husbands and some of their offspring flew in. Tobias's band played and I danced with the freewheeling women in my writing group. Lisa set up a bookselling table and friends generously stood in line to purchase books and have me sign them. While turning my Sharpie loose on book after book, it finally became real to me: my book! Did I have Parkinson's? Not that night! I spoke into a microphone for the first time in my life. I was nervous, since presenting to groups has never been easy for me, but being in that crowd of well-wishers was like soaking in a warm bath.

From November through April, I talked about Dream House in the west and in New England at bookstores, private parties, newspaper and radio interviews, seven book groups and an architecture school. Awesome family and friends from around the country facilitated opportunities for me to speak and sell books. Mindful of my energy's ebb and flow, I only scheduled events where I knew people who would fill the chairs.

I never stopped feeling nervous when approaching the podium, afraid I'd go blank in the middle of a thought. I did a couple of times, but managed to recover well enough. After describing the inspirations for the novel, I would read a couple of passages and feel my anxiety drop away. Speaking the words I'd written, I re-experienced the passion I'd felt when I started the book years ago. It was powerful to feel I was engaging my listeners' emotions and imagination, not by selling plot or drama but simply through my choice and arrangement of words. Finally, I was out of my room, playing my music. People were listening.

I didn't push much beyond my limitations to publicize Dream House, so the post-publication experience was entirely positive. Even at the event in my hometown, 3000 miles away, where I feared God-knows-who would surface to scold me with a wagging finger for airing my family's troubles, people were warm, inquisitive and even a little proud of their homie author. In addition to old family friends I hadn't seen in decades, two of my first childhood girlfriends were in that room, as well as my first love; their presence added a distracting tenderness to the occasion. Everywhere I went, I filled with gratitude for people's inquisitiveness, enthusiasm, and their persistent pursuit of literature. That Lewis was the best roadie ever made all the difference. It was as if he'd read a manual on how to support your Parkie wife while she's on a book tour. He hefted my carryon into the overhead bin. Took my hand in the airport when he saw my leg dragging. Schlepped boxes of books and ran peoples' credit cards at private events. While at our Airbnb, he dashed to the market for groceries, made me coffee every morning and, in the evenings before my book talks, a mini margarita to boost my confidence. (Trust me; it works.) Each day, he rode a bike for an hour and a half but insisted he wasn't too tired to go back out and take a three mile walk with me, because he knows that exercise is what keeps my body from shutting down altogether. He was excited to greet the wonderful old friends who came out of the woodwork. Throughout the ""season of Dream House,"" Lewis expressed no complaints. He had lost his partner in architecture years before, but was now proud to crow about her book to anyone who'd listen. He was thrilled for me, but also, like many partners of those with debilitating conditions, he understands the importance of turning up the light on life's joyful passages and significant accomplishments. So, how did it feel to finally be published at 60? Besides joy, another feeling: relief when I finished my book tour. Taking stock of my Parkinson's progression, I had a sense that publication came not a moment -- or at least year -- too soon. Also a relief was to be done with the story that had been parked in my brain like a giant RV full of claustrophobic family members, and to clear out my cabinet filled with paper drafts, some dating back to the late 20th century. I could move on. Parkinson's added to my life a new community of friends like Hadley with whom I can share the experience of our disease. The release of Dream House provided another avenue for making meaningful connections. Friends and total strangers have written to me about why they resonated with the novel; the territories that I'd burned to explore ignited in them vivid memories and powerful emotions. I've felt honored and delighted that they've shared, sometimes in intimate detail, tales of their complicated relationships with a house, with a parent, or their children. This -- touching the hearts and minds of my readers and in return, being moved by their stories -- was the least expected but greatest reward of realizing my long-time dream.

ARTS & CULTURE,"Stage Door: Ute Lemper's Songs From The Broken Heart, Confucius"," Ute Lemper, the acclaimed German chanteuse, bares her continental soul at the inviting 54 Below nightclub, downstairs from Studio 54, tonight and tomorrow. The great Kurt Weill interpreter is taking a departure from her acclaimed repertoire. Noted for her charismatic delivery of Weimar-era classics, Lemper navigates a more intimate musical universe in Songs From the Broken Heart.  Her current incarnation features a few Brechtian numbers from the streets of Berlin. But the evening isn't a showcase of her classic Fritz Hollander or Jacques Brel numbers.  It's a more personal journey that traverses her interior landscape, addressing the pain of life. She showcases her musical artistry, using the poetry of Charles Bukowski or Pablo Neruda for inspiration. Her sensitivity to suffering is pronounced. This is art as introspection, searching for the truth of existence. Themes of death, love and redemption permeate her oeuvre. So does humor. She manages, in the guise of Mac the Knife, to take theatrical swipes at Donald Trump.  Though singing numbers in French, German, English and Yiddish, Broken Heart focuses on a more modern repertoire -- Lemper interprets the songs of Nick Cave, Philip Glass and Tom Waits, backed by an accomplished quartet. Her range, much like her electric rapport with the audience, is legendary. Lemper doesn't just sing, she embodies her music. And it achieves added resonance by the historic, political and cultural backdrop in which she carefully sets her selections. Lempers's nightclub performances -- versus the large concert-hall venues she regularly plays in Europe and Canada -- are sexy and intimate. She's been known to entice people on stage and tease audiences with her ""boa moment."" Such external stagecraft has been replaced by a quieter, more reflective mood.  ""Hell is built piece by piece,"" she sings; in a jazzy rendition of emotional infernos. She has, as Eugene O'Neill wrote, ""a touch of the poet."" Lemper strips away life's pretense and vanity; our tortured souls are her canvas -- and she executes her portraits with a masterful hand. A second global import, Confucius, a new dance drama performed by the China National Opera & Dance Drama Theater at Lincoln Center, is a hypnotic production headed to Washington, D.C. Jan. 13-15.  The opera tells the tale of the famous scholar's journey through the kingdoms of the Zhua Dynasty and his quest to bring a philosophy of benevolence, harmony and righteousness to its decadent, indifferent ruler.  Boasting traditional Chinese music, stunning costumes (Yang Donglin) and set design (Ren Dongsheng), the show is told in six sections. Set during a chaotic time in Chinese history, the 55-strong ensemble delivers a mesmerizing performance, aided by a compelling Hu Yang as Confucius and Tang Shiyi as Concubine. Shiyi is so graceful; it is like watching the breeze dance.   For Americans, it's a remarkable opportunity to appreciate the splendor and singularity of Chinese dance and music, deftly directed by Kong Dexin, a 77th-generation direct descendant of Confucius.

ARTS & CULTURE,Donna Quesada: Art Review,"My dear friend Larry Payne mentioned that he had just purchased three watercolor paintings, so I arranged a visit to this exciting new artist's atelier. Based in Culver City, CA, Donna Quesada finds inspiration in nature. Towering over her home studio are two giant sycamore trees that she says are the sole survivors of what was once a line of 122 brothers and sisters. Intertwined among them now are various other plants and trees, such as palms, umbrellas and even banana trees.  Donna showed me her paintings and the first thing I noticed was that some of her exquisitely ornate watercolors had a slightly Asian feel. Donna said that she loves to work with a special Japanese ink called sumi-é, which she often uses alongside watercolor. It is the sumi-é that gives many of her pieces an eastern feel.  Here are four of my favorites:  I loved the black trees juxtaposed by the bright leaves in ""Yellow Autumn Trees."" It is simple yet dramatic and striking, immediately conveying the feeling of the changing season.  ""Pink Blowing Tree"" was another immediate favorite. If you look closely you can see layers of splattered paint in myriad colors bursting off of the canvas and making the painting feel dynamic and alive. I loved the paradoxical mood created by the dark ink background with the brightness of the sky and the tree. This is a very exciting painting.  With the sycamores above the studio, it is easy to see how ""Sycamore Tree"" came into fruition. The upward perspective was dizzying and enticing; it made me feel as if the tree was reaching towards the infinite.    With its subdued palette of earthy colors and speckled snow, ""Boy & Dog in the Snow"" is a vivid impression of a winter day in the woods.  For more information please visit www.DonnaQuesada.com"
ARTS & CULTURE,Top 5 Sizzling Hot Winter Music Festivals in Frigid New York City,"
(l. to r.) Andrew Cyrille; photo: Petra Cvelbar; Thelonious Monk (1966); photo: Everett Collection By Dan Ouellette, ZEALnyc Senior Editor, December 28, 2016 Think the brutal cold and sometimes snow or freezing rain of New York in January can keep musicians and crowds off the streets and huddled under blankets at home? Think again. In fact, it seems that the city's annual festivals have found a vital life in one of the darkest and bleakest months of the year. Think of it as the heat factor in the short days of daylight. There is no hibernation season, but rather a sizzling of high-caliber music that has been sprouting to life despite the chill. You'd think summer, with all its green glory, would be the season of choice for music--especially jazz--to swing right into our lives. But the gray, leafless, snowy or icy season of the winter wonderland has in recent years made for a different kind of celebration that eclipses other times of the year. Of course, the cultural impact of New York City, in all its boroughs, is the grand central of local and international musicians gathering in artistic anticipation. It could well be the act of keeping warm by gathering. Herein are the top 5 fests of the wintertide. ••• Five Snowballs: NYC Winter Jazzfest, January 5-10 What started twelve years ago as an inspired goal of giving voice to the plethora of relatively unknown but immensely talented jazz musicians toiling in the multitude of the New York's tiny and obscure clubs, the Jazzfest has become hands down the best festival for jazz in the entire year in a city where improvised music never sleeps. Some call it the SXSW of jazz. It's immense. This year's fest stretches over six days, highlighted by the two-night Jazzfest Marathon on Friday, Jan. 6 and continues on Saturday, Jan. 7 at thirteen venues in and around Greenwich Village and across Lower Manhattan. More than 140 different groups comprising four hundred musicians take the various stages. The range of music is dizzying. There's a not-to-be-missed opening night show (Thursday, Jan. 5 at Le Poisson Rouge) featuring jazz elder saxophonist Pharoah Sanders (who played in one of John Coltrane's later bands) and the young upstart from Britain, saxophonist Shabaka Hutchings, who is one of the most dynamic young saxophonists in jazz today--though not well known because he hails from across the pond and has rarely played in the U.S. The bookend of the fest takes place on Tuesday, Jan. 10, when Le Poisson Rouge presents Charlie Haden's Liberation Music Orchestra and its Concert for Social Justice with special guest pianist Geri Allen and arrangements by LMO co-founder Carla Bley. In between, there's a plethora of jazz wonder, including salutes two of jazz's top labels, Blue Note and ECM, with bands from their stables. Plus there's a #BlackLivesMatter showcase of poetry and song by several groups as well as the Jazz Legends Play for Disability Pride NYC benefit concert at the Quaker's Friends Meeting House. Salutes go to two of jazz's greats: artist in residence drummer/composer Andrew Cyrille and a special honoring of the 100th birthday anniversary of one of jazz's top masters: piano genius Thelonious Monk--one of the most influential artists to the new class of jazz musicians. If it all seems a bit overwhelming, well, it is--like going to the North Sea Jazz Festival in July in Rotterdam and being faced with acts playing on 13 different stages all at the same time. So, a word to the potentially weary: choose carefully and become immersed in only tidbits of the offerings. ••• Four Snowballs: globalFEST, January 8, Webster Hall Granted it's only a one-night shot (scaled down from what it used to be), but globalFEST (globalfest.org) is a multifarious extravaganza of world music from around the planet that takes place in the multiple performance spaces in Webster Hall). ""This year's edition brings us full circle to why we started globalFEST in 2003 following 9/11 and the country's closing of borders,"" noted globalFEST co-founder Isabel Soffer. ""We wanted to encourage our colleagues in the performing arts field to take artistic risks, and put international perspectives centerstage."" With ""building bridges"" culturally by music as its theme, this year's edition features tradion and experimentalists including old-school Congo rumba by L'Orchestre Afrisa International), Africa-rooted Latin by Betsayda Machado, socio-political Cuban club music by Batida, shaman-rooted glam rock of Korea's SsingSsing, African nu-soul singer Jojo Abot, and digital-looping Estonian folk violinist/singer Maarja Nuut. Also on the program are the global facets of very regional American styles: D.C.'s Rare Essence's funk-fired go-go and Ranky Tanky's take on the Gullah Sea Island traditions in South Carolina. Added tastemaker and festival co-founder Bill Bragin: ""globalFEST strongly believes that these unique cultural and personal expressions are what bring us closer together as a society. Diversity is a force that unites, not divides."" Indeed this is the world in all its diverse beauty. There is no place to better dive into the wealth of the world's music on the same evening as globalFEST. It's a unique event--only in New York--put together by the wise and wily expertise of the show's founders and programmers. Support it! Lineup of artists for this year's globalFEST: * AlSarah and the Nubatones (Sudan/Brooklyn): East African Retro-Pop
* Batida (Portugal/Angola): Afro electronic dance party
* Betsayda Machado y La Parranda El Clavo (Venezuela): Powerhouse Afro-Venezuelan vocalist (U.S. debut)
* Jojo Abot (Ghana/Denmark/USA): Experimental Afropolitan pop-soul
* Hoba Hoba Spirit (Morocco): Casablanca's irreverent rock stars.
* L'Orchestre Afrisa International et M'bilia Bel (DRC/USA): Tabu Ley Rochereau's Congolese rumba legends return
* Maarja Nuut featuring Hendrik Kaljujärv (Estonia): Digital Estonian folk soundscapes
* Ranky Tanky (USA): Funky Gullah songs of the South Carolina Sea Islands
* Rare Essence (USA): D.C.'s pioneering polyrhythmic Go-Go superstars
* Rudresh Mahanthappa's Indo-Pak Coalition (USA): Indo-jazz
* Septeto Santiaguero (Cuba): Grammy-winning son cubano stars
* SsingSsing (Korea): Shamanistic Korean folk songs meet rock ••• Three Snowballs: Jazz at Lincoln Center, January/February Lineup While Jazz at Lincoln Center is not advertising it as such, but iut sure looks like a January/February festival if there ever has been. Whether it's staged at Rose Theater (the centerpiece of the jazz performance spaces) or at the amphitheater-like stage, the Appel Room with its backdrop of a picture window onto the colorful Columbus Circle, the shows this winter are top-tier events. A brief overview: * Branford Marsalis Quartet With Special Guest Vocalist Kurt Elling: January 20-21, Rose Theater
This collaboration, once viewed as a one-shot event/recording, has been a perfect fit. Adventurous jazz from the saxophonist teamed with the quirky, equally daring vocals by one of the best in jazz makes for a special evening of song. * Celebrating Dizzy Gillespie: January 26-28, Rose Theater
The Diz would have been 100 years old this year. While he passed away in 1993, nearly a quarter century ago, the trumpeter/musical adventurer--who co-founded the bebop movement and brought Afro-Cuban music into the jazz vernacular--still influences the vital music of today. Wynton Marsalis leads his Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra with musical director Vincent Gardner in well-recognized Dizzy standards (i.e., ""Salt Peanuts,"" ""Night in Tunisia"") as well new pieces inspired by the icon. * The Latin Side of Dizzy With Carlos Henriquez: January 27-28, Appel Room
Musical director and bassist Carlos Henriquez brings together an all-star Latin jazz cast to celebrate Gillespie's contribution to Latin jazz. * Dianne Reeves: February 10-11, Rose Theater
One of the top-tier jazz singers of this generation, the Grammy Award-winning Dianne Reeves sings lush swing for this special pre-Valentine engagement. Love and romance in the mix! * Jazz of the '50s: Overflowing With Style: February 17-18, Rose Theater
While today's jazz continues to evolve and grow in experimentation and in popularity, the golden age of the idiom historically inarguably took place in the 1950s. Wynton Marsalis and his Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra with musical director Chris Crenshaw prove that assessment by performing the classic music of the eras by Miles Davis, Art Blakey, Gerry Mulligan and others. ••• Two Snowballs: The Ferus Festival, January 5-10 In its fourth annual year, the Ferus Festival sets up shop in January at National Sawdust, curated by its in-house producing and touring company VisionIntoArt. This festival features ""untamed voices"" showcasing multimedia collaborations and works-in-progress. As might be expected with National Sawdust, the mix is very eclectic, including collaborations in new music, theater and multimedia by innovative international and local artists A snapshot roundup of shows: * M IS BLACK ENOUGH: Poetry by Roger Bonair-Agard; music by Andy Akiho, Thursday, January 5 * The Afield and Nelson Patton with Lonnie Holley (split bill): Friday, January 6
Visual and textual storytelling within musical performance. Violinist Rebecca Fischer performs with a band and a film by Anthony Hawley is shown; Nelson Patton is an experimental duo of looped trombone (Dave Nelson) and drums & Moog bass pedals (Marlon Patton) with Lonnie Holley contributing vocals. * Revert to Sea created and composed by Yuka C. Honda: Friday, January 6
Multimedia work-in-progress based on the writings of Japanese author Ryu Murakami, created and composed by Yuka C. Honda and performed by Honda, Alex Cline, Nels Cline, Devin Hoff and Zeena Parkins with video production by Brian Close, Kiki Kudo and Honda. * Requiem for: A Tuesday: Saturday, January 7

Music composed by Sophia Brous, Leo Abrahams and David Coulter. ••• One Snowball: Evolving--Justice Is Compassion/Not a Police State In this massive festival of social commentary, Evolving runs from January 2 through 22 (except 1/8 and 1/15) at Abrazo Interno Gallery, Clemente Soto Valez Cultural Center (107 Suffolk Street, Manhattan). Three sets each night by an array of under-the-cover jazz ensembles musically speaking out on the big clampdown we all fear. Let music be our shield!

ARTS & CULTURE,Defending their lives in 'Ride the Cyclone',"
By Jil Picariello, ZEALnyc Theater Editor, December 26, 2016 If you took the movies Defending Your Life and Final Destination (the third one, to be specific) and mixed them in a blender with Glee and then put the result on a stage, you might get Ride the Cyclone. It's a weird little musical comedy about a horrific disaster: six members of the Saint Cassian High School Chamber Choir of Uranium City, Saskatchewan meet their tragic demise when a roller coaster goes off the rails. Yes, they're dead. But now, thanks to a mechanical fortune teller (add Big to the mix), they discover that one of them can return to life, via a unanimous vote of the group. Each defends his life in turn, the Tracy Flick-ish Ocean O'Connell Rosenberg (her parents were uber-hippes), chubby and schlubby Constance Blackwood (her catchphrase is ""I'm sorry""), Ukranian-born would-be rapper Mischa Bachinski, Marlene Dietrich wannabe Noel Gruber, fantasy lover Ricky Potts, and a spooky sixth contestant identified only as Jane Doe, because she, literally, lost her head in the fatal accident and remains unidentified. All of the performances are terrific, revealing both the teenage cliché of their characters, as well as the genuine human being underneath. And it's charmingly pulled together by director and choreographer Rachel Rockwell, doing a fine service to the hilarious, inventive, and often surprising work of writers Brooke Maxwell and Jacob Richmond. It's creepy, it's campy, it's touching, and, for a musical about a bunch of dead teenagers, it's very funny. Take a ride. ____________________ Ride the Cyclone at the Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, through December 29, 2016. Running time is 1 hour and 30 minutes with no intermission. Book, music and lyrics by Jacob Richmond and Brooke Maxwell. Directed by Rachel Rockwell.

ARTS & CULTURE,Discovering In Parenthesis,"A traveling fellowship had brought me after college to London. My roommate there, a young civil servant, son of a Cambridge don, and a reader of Persian literature in the original, suggested that I start paying attention to a British artist called David Jones, author of a long poem with the title of In Parenthesis. Despite having attended a good university in the U.S., I'd never even heard of Jones. Was this recommendation an act of aesthetic chauvinism?
	Okay, so T.S. Eliot had called In Parenthesis ""a work of genius."" But Eliot was the book's acquiring editor at Faber. W.H. Auden had written that David Jones had given us ""probably the finest long poem written in English in this century."" But like the author Auden had grown up English (and was still living there). Perhaps, I wondered, he was somehow prejudiced in the poet's favor? Ezra Pound was neither the publisher nor a Brit. Pound had concluded: ""it is one of the most important poems of our time."" He called it ""a masterpiece.""
	David Jones wrote about the Great War, in which he fought, and his style was influenced by, almost marinated in, Welsh culture and Arthurian legend or, as Jones called the culture he brought, ""the matter of Britain."" I read up a little about the poet and bought his work at Foyle's bookshop, an easy walk from my flat on Great Russell Street, across from where Karl Marx had written his famous manifesto and near the offices of the original publisher of In Parenthesis.
 Jones was both a poet and painter. In fact, Kenneth Clark described him in the mid-1930s as ""the most gifted of all the young British painters."" Of course this combination immediately reminded people of William Blake, whose work, like that of Jones, has hung at the Tate.
	When my English roommate invited me for a weekend at his family's holiday house in Herefordshire, near the Welsh border, I was happy for the opportunity to walk in the mountains. My roommate had already impressed me as a happy eccentric by bringing in the Times every morning and adding it to a stack of a year's worth of newspapers, then pulling out the bottom paper, with the same date but a year earlier, and taking it on the Underground to the office. He said it was restful to know how things had come out.
	From the holiday house we walked to the nearby border of Wales and along a long ridge, looking down on a small settlement that he told me was called Capel-y-ffin (though I didn't know about the doubled ""f"" until later). I vaguely recognized the name. Yes, David Jones had lived there in the late 1920s, joining a community of artists led by Eric Gill. I'd heard that Gill had designed more than one typeface, including one inspired by signs in the London Underground, and now I learned that he worked extensively as an engraver in stone.
	My friend and I decided to descend to Capel-y-ffin. As I recall, the run down was quite steep. For me it was like falling down the rabbit hole in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. Of all the obscure settlements tucked into the Welsh hills, we had happened on one that had some meaning to me. Arriving on the valley floor, we met a family arriving to occupy holiday accommodations they'd rented. They invited us to join them for tea. Our hosts were as new to the place as my friend and I. As we looked around the rooms I was astonished to spot a mural by David Jones.
	I recognized his style, having looked up some of his work as an engraver and watercolorist in the drawers of a London gallery. However, I'd been procrastinating over studying In Parenthesis, Jones' 1937 subtle, allusive, powerful book about the war that had ended almost two decades earlier.
	I'd known the Great War was a disaster to many who fought. One whole wall of the cloister in an Oxford college was covered with the names of graduates who had died in that war. In those years they called the result of frequent nearby explosions ""shell shock"" or what we today term ""post-traumatic stress disorder."" Long incubated, In Parenthesis was one of David Jones' ways of living with PTSD, a way that, like his intricate, overlaid visual art, has become a gift to many others.
	It was not until graduate school that I had an opportunity, in a seminar on ""war poets,"" to write about David Jones. Both my fellow students and also the professor had never heard of him. The reputation of artists has always been fickle. Herman Melville was not celebrated for Moby Dick until the 20th century. As for painters, consider this passage from The Art of Rivalry: ""They were modern artists in search of a public. It was a search fraught with risk and uncertain reward, as they knew from the stories of their immediate predecessors: the Impressionists, who struggled for so long in poverty; Manet, who was so relentlessly abused; van Gogh, who took his own life; and Cézanne, who labored his entire life in obscurity.""
	After the sojourn in Europe, my grad school years coincided with the Vietnam war and the anti-war movement that was especially strong on campuses. Of course the mechanics of war were different than those experienced by David Jones: helicopter gunships instead of rushes ""over the top,"" napalm instead of mainly artillery shells and machine-guns, and so forth. But the experience of not knowing whether you'd be alive the next day, or minute, was similar. And it was not until half a century after Vietnam that the first effective treatments for PTSD were even the subject of research.
	Poetry does not by itself heal PTSD, but it can at least express something of the experience of war, even if you read the poem in a campus easy chair. Veterans typically don't talk much about the war after returning home. At a party in the 1990s I met a World War II vet who, at that distance, standing around a swimming pool, surrounded by old friends, was willing to answer my eager questions about his experience as a young solider. He said he had not talked about his feelings for half a century, because who wanted to listen? I felt honored by his trust, as I had been moved by David Jones' generous, heartfelt, book-length poem.
	In writing Gift of Darkness, a memoir about the adolescence of a Jewish friend who had grown up under Nazi rule in his native Amsterdam, I felt gratitude to him for being willing to revisit the trauma of those years and respond to my thousands of questions. In his poetry, what David Jones did was ask himself thousands of questions and hunt for words to express the truth of what he felt. That day in the Black Mountains of Wales, I could only imagine that peaceful Capel-y-ffin had helped him to get from the battlefield to In Parenthesis. (Which is now available from the reprints division of The New York Review of Books.)
	The poem opens with the hero John Ball late for parade. ""Private Ball's pack, ill adjusted and without form, hangs more heavily on his shoulder blades, a sense of ill-usage pervades him. He withdraws within himself to soothe himself--the iniquity of those in high places is forgotten."" So it begins, the work of remembering what was immediate and timeless."
ARTS & CULTURE,Stage Door: Finian's Rainbow," It may be a bit of blarney, but the current revival of Finian's Rainbow at the Irish Rep is charming and magical. Director Charlotte Moore's scaled-down production offers an intimacy and meaning somewhat lost in the 2009 Broadway version. It also hits the right political note, especially in a post-election world. The Burton Lane-Yip Harburg musical, set in the segregated 1947 South, addresses racism, corrupt politicians and immigration -- within a fantastical setting.  If it resonates today, with lines like ""I've been bothered by immigrants ever since I got to this country,"" so much the better.  The show has lost none of its relevance, and its racial plot twist, while simple, remains a clever theatrical device. Finian, a spry Irishman (Ken Jennings) and his daughter Sharon (a mesmerizing Melissa Errico) come to America with a stolen pot of gold. Throw in friendly sharecroppers, a growing leprechaun (a delightful Mark Evans) and sweep-you-off-your-feet romance for good measure.  If that sounds too saccharine, consider the memorable score.  Songs like ""Old Devil Moon,"" the bluesy ""Necessity"" and ""How are Things in Glocca Morra?"" are glorious. Errico has played Sharon in previous incarnations -- and she sounds better than ever, accompanied by a first-rate chamber quartet: piano, harp, cello and fiddle.  The social satire is light, but it makes the point -- and no one can resist the songs, be they romantic or energetic, such as ""The Great Come-And-Get-It Day."" Every number clicks, and the first-rate cast doesn't miss a beat.  Barry McNabb's choreography and James Morgan's set design make the most of the small space, proving less is more.   Part fairy tale, part commentary, Finian's Rainbow has something to say about tolerance, love and the importance of dreams. And that message never grows old. Photos: Carol Rosegg"

ARTS & CULTURE,"Thomas Bayrle at Lenbachhaus München, Kunstbau (VIDEO)","In 2012, the German artist Thomas Bayrle caused a stir when he presented a series of running engines that he had cut open at one of the world's most important art events, Documenta 13 in Kassel (Germany). Accompanied by soundtracks that are largely excerpts from pertinent passages in the ecclesiastical liturgy, the artworks demonstrate the aesthetic of machinery as well as the rhythm and condition of human life in the mass society. The complete set of these pieces are now on view at Lehnbachhaus in Munich (Germany), together with a huge site-specific wall installation and all his early films. Thomas Bayrle was born in Berlin (Germany) in 1937. Bayrle's work was on view at the Venice Biennale in 2003 and 2009 and at documenta, Kassel, in 1964, 1977, and 2012. The artist lives and works in Frankfurt am Main, Germany. He currently also has a solo exhibition at the ICA in Miami (until March 26, 2017).  Thomas Bayrle: Hochamt, 2010 (Radial engine, electric drive, sound). The exhibition at Städtische Galerie im Lenbachhaus und Kunstbau München is curated by Eva Huttanlauch and runs until March 5, 2017.

ARTS & CULTURE,Another Hero Departed: Monuments Man Bernard Taper,"On October 17, Bernard Taper, one of my heroes, died. He was 98 years of age. Bernie spent his life as a journalist and educator. He also authored several outstanding books. But I knew him for his career as a Monuments Man. In 2005, when I chartered a course to tell these heroes' story, Bernie was the first Monuments Man I met; the first to open up and share his wartime experiences. In the years since, I would meet, interview--and become friends with--twenty others, but like most ""firsts,"" the memory of that meeting made a lasting impression. His loss is a painful reminder that within the next five years, most of the World War II veterans--in our country we know them as the ""Greatest Generation""--will be gone. My young son will grow up in a world where these brave men who saved and then changed our world will be known to him in history books, and through recounting my stories. That is an enormous loss for our society, and in the case of Bernie and the other thirteen Monuments Men and Women who have passed, a deeply personal loss for me.
My last meeting with Bernie at his home in Berkeley, CA. Born in Scotland to Jewish immigrants from Poland and Romania, Bernie spent the first eleven years of his life living in London. In 1929, following the death of his father, this eleven-year old boy traversed the Atlantic aboard a small merchant ship that passed through the Panama Canal on its way to his new home, that of his grandparents who lived in Los Angeles.  Bernie's curious mind was constantly absorbing knowledge:  he learned to speak German listening to the radio.  His interest in journalism blossomed at a young age. While attending Los Angeles High School he wrote and edited the school's newspaper. At the University of California at Berkeley he served as editor of the university's paper in addition to founding two student magazines. After graduating with a Bachelor's degree in 1943, he began writing articles for Agenda, the San Francisco-based magazine devoted to architecture and public planning. He later moved to New York City, where his journalistic ability flourished at some of the leading publications of the times including The Nation, The New Republic, and The New Yorker. Following the United States' entry into World War II, Bernie was drafted into the U.S. Army. After working briefly in the San Francisco shipyards, he was officially inducted and attached to an anti-aircraft battalion. His unit trained in Death Valley, California, where the desert terrain was intended to prepare them for action against General Rommel's forces in Egypt and the Middle East.  When I asked him why his battalion never saw active duty, he chuckled, and then told me that the only thing they ever hit was the plane towing the targets. Taper then enrolled in a thirteen-week Infantry Officer's Training School at Ft. Benning, Georgia, where he became a full United States citizen upon completion. He subsequently returned to the UC Berkeley to teach English to non-English speaking Army personnel.
Lt. Bernard Taper In early summer 1946, Bernie become a Monuments Man stationed in Germany. He quickly put his journalistic skills to work tracking down leads to find still missing works of art that the Nazis had looted. Bernie worked alongside Monuments Men Edgar Breitenbach and Maj. Karol Estreicher, the Polish art restitution officer. His work with local German police forces created a vast network of information that helped the Monuments Men recover works of art looted from the famed Goudstikker collection, among others. He also pursued works of art belonging to the Adolphe Schloss collection, which the Nazis had stolen and stored in the basement of Hitler's Munich headquarters before mobs broke into the building and emptied it. One his more colorful cases involved hunting down works of art local townspeople in Berchtesgaden had taken from a train filled with objects looted by Nazi Reichsmarshall Hermann Goering. As too often happened during the void--the closing days before and after the official end of the war in Europe--looters had looted the Nazi loot making the work of the Monuments Men even more difficult. In 1948 Bernie visited Spandau prison, where he interrogated prominent Nazi officials including Albert Speer, Heinrich Hoffman, Baldur von Schirach, Walther Funk, Karl Haberstock, and Walter Hofer.  Certainly Bernie's most prominent case remains a mystery today:  the disappearance of Raphael's Portrait of a Young Man, stolen by the Nazis in 1939 from the Czartoryski collection in Kracow, Poland. Bernie and I discussed this case more than any other topic in our many hours of conversation. This painting, along with Leonardo da Vinci's Lady With an Ermine (also stolen from the Czartoryski collection), were the two most prominent masterpieces in Poland destined for Hitler's planned Führermuseum. When the Monuments Men arrested Nazi Governor-General Hans Frank in early May 1945, they found the Leonardo, but there was no sign of the Raphael. When we last visited at his home in Berkeley, Bernie shared with me his various theories and recounted additional steps he wished he had taken. Sadly, despite his many accomplishments as a Monuments Officer, the missing Raphael haunted Bernie for the rest of his life.  Bernie left Germany in August 1948 and resumed his career as a successful journalist. During his service as a Monuments Man, he had continued writing and sent numerous articles back to the United States for publication. Following his years in New York City, Bernie returned to California.  He worked for five years as a reporter for the San Francisco Chronicle, during which time he received a Press Club award for his investigation of a housing discrimination case. In 1955 he returned to his academic studies and earned a Master's degree in English from Stanford University. The following year he began an almost forty-year term as a staff writer for the The New Yorker. From 1970 to 1998, in conjunction with his work with The New Yorker, Taper taught the next generation of journalists as Professor at the Graduate School of Journalism at the University of California at Berkeley. A prolific writer, Bernie wrote numerous books, articles, and columns about subjects relating to the arts, civil rights, and urban affairs. His published works include Balanchine (1963), the authoritative biography of George Balanchine, the New York City Ballet's co-founder and hallmark choreographer, The Arts in Boston (1970), Cellist in Exile: A Portrait of Pablo Casals (1962), and Gomillion versus Lightfoot: The Right to Vote in Apartheid Alabama (1962). Taper also served as editor of the anthology Mark Twain's San Francisco (1963). In 2004 he donated his collection of photographs of George Balanchine to the San Francisco Performing Arts Library & Museum. I have many cherished memories in the company of this fine man. On June 6, 2007, the 63rd anniversary of the D-Day landings, we arranged for Bernie and his wife Gwen to travel to Washington to be present when I announced the creation of the Monuments Men Foundation for the Preservation of Art. Earlier that day Congress had passed a resolution honoring the Monuments Men and women. Bernie, and three other Monuments Men he was meeting for the first time--Harry Ettlinger, James Reeds, and Horace Apgar--had a chance to be formally recognized for their service by several members of the House and Senate, including Congresswoman Kay Granger, and Senators Kay Bailey Hutchison and Hillary Clinton. But the prized moment was our visit to the National World War II Memorial. There, walking between the fountains representing the war's two theaters, looking at the names of the most prominent battles, I watched these aged war veterans, including my father, overwhelmed with gratitude to have survived, and grief for all those who did not.  In October 2015, Bernie would make one more journey before his death, once again to Washington, D.C., to attend the presentation ceremony of the Congressional Gold Medal honoring the Monuments Men and Women, our nation's highest civilian honor. Four of the seven living Monuments Men and women attended, and nearly two-hundred family members of Monuments Men since passed. Seeing them honored by the Speaker of the House, John Boehner, and praised by the leadership of both parties in Congress, fulfilled a dream I had held dear for nearly ten years. I can only imagine what it meant to them.
The Congressional Gold Medal Ceremony in Washington, D.C. On October 22, 2015  (From left to right:  Speaker of the House John Boehner; Monuments Men Harry Ettlinger and Richard Barancik; Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell; Monuments Woman Motoko Fujishiro Huthwaite; Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid; House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi; and Monuments Man Bernie Taper) That day, I was honored to be asked to speak about the Monuments Men before this august group. I closed my remarks with a thought about the importance of what men like Bernard Taper had achieved not just for their country, but for people of good will around the world. It bears repeating: ""We live in hope that the wisdom of Monuments Man George Stout, the sacrifices of Monuments Men Balfour and Huchthausen, and the dedication of all those who served in the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives section, will not reside in our memory, rather that they will live on in our hearts to inspire us to do a far better job protecting and preserving those things of knowledge and beauty that we have inherited from the past.""  Bernie hated war. Germany's smashed cities embarrassed him. But this only strengthened his resolve to do everything possible to help others by locating and returning works of art and other cultural objects to their rightful owners. Bernie believed that the work of the Monuments Men and Women was a noble endeavor, an undertaking that would reestablish the rule of law and for him at least, make some sense of the destruction that surrounded him. Yes, he was a journalist, and an educator, and an author, but he was also one of the millions of citizen soldiers who helped build and shape the world we have inherited, a world based on basic human decency and shared sacrifice. I miss Bernie; I miss that world. With his death, there are now just six living Monuments Men; four men, and two women, one British. *      *      * Follow Robert M.

ARTS & CULTURE,The First,"A package arrived at home recently and I was excited to open it, as I knew what it contained, the new recording of all the Bach Sonatas and Partitas for solo violin played by one of my favourite artists, Kyung-wha Chung. Listening to this wonderful recording brought back many memories of this great violinist and her astonishing career, which in turn inspired me to tell a story. (photo by Simon Fowler)

In 1967 an extraordinary political event occurred. The Leventritt International Violin Competition in the US announced after the final round that they were awarding two first prizes--to Pinchas Zukerman, who everyone expected to win outright, and a young unknown 19-year-old girl from South Korea, Kyung-wha Chung, a Juilliard student studying with Ivan Galamian. The judges had, in fact, decided that this young unknown was the only winner and it took the intervention of Zukerman's mentor and champion, the violinist Isaac Stern, to argue for the compromise that was eventually announced.  Kyung-wha's historic win, the first ever for a non-western musician, launched a legendary career.  It also laid the foundation and inspiration for the astonishing talent from this part of Asia, including Kyung-wha's brother, the conductor Myung-whun Chung, and her sister the cellist, Myung-wha Chung.  Then in 1970, another major event occurred that was perhaps even more significant. The young violinist stood in for an indisposed Itzhak Perlman at the Royal Festival Hall in London with the LSO and Andre Previn, playing the Tchaikovsky Concerto. This came at such short notice that there was no rehearsal time with the orchestra so Kyung-wha just got up there and played as if her life depended upon it. My wife, Virginia, was at the concert and she still talks about it as one of the most exciting performances of the Tchaikovsky she has ever heard. The critics that night were certainly in agreement and Heifetz and Oistrakh, the then accepted gods of the violin, were invoked with very favorable comparisons, and the evening was seen as the beginning of a major career in Europe. It was also the start of a new relationship for Kyung-wha, and the LSO and Previn who took the young violinist to their hearts. Plans were quickly made to record the Tchaikovsky paired with the Sibelius Concerto. The latter was a work the violinist knew but had not performed for a long time and in flying back to London from Seoul for the recording she had to beg the use of an office at her layover airport, just to get in as much practice of the work as possible. If you listen to these two recordings today they remain as fresh, musical and extraordinary as the amazing events surrounding her of 1970. I heard her play live for the first time in Cardiff in 1971 with the virtuoso showpiece Lalo's Symphonie Espagnole. I was totally smitten. This was a truly great violinist but also much more than that, a communicator, whose physicality when playing was unprecedented in my experience. She played with unbridled passion, making every note, every phrase something special, imbued with a type of energy and commitment that I had seldom heard.  I have listened to her many times since in most of the great concertos and in one or two recitals including one devoted to the works of Kreisler celebrating his centennial in 1974. I remember the Elgar Concerto in Liverpool where she played this most demanding of concertos for the first time, exploring its vast emotional range in a reading full of musical eloquence. (You can hear this in her recording for DECCA.) Having conquered the heights of this massive work she left the stage to huge applause and was then heard to give a vast scream in the wings, not from frustration or anger, but just to release the tension of making it through this marathon work. This seemed to make the evening even more personal and special.  Then there was the Brahms Concerto, which I heard her play many times and each time it grew in intensity. A friend of mine commented after one performance that she played from the depths of the soles of her feet connected to the inner earth, and I have always found this a very accurate description of her music making. It's the duende that the Spanish apply to the most special artists.  In September 10, 2001, I heard her in the Sibelius Concerto with the Oregon Symphony in Portland, which I was then running.  She played with the same passionate commitment you find in her recording from 1970. The next morning, September 11, I had to call her at her hotel with the news of the attack on the Twin Towers. It was early and she didn't know about the tragic events and pain and anxiety were suddenly there in her voice. But that night she played the concerto again with the orchestra for a bereft public contending with its own grief and needing music more than ever before. She gave the performance everything and then wanted to know if she could do more to help. In 2005, she suffered an injury to her hand and announced that she would be retiring from the concert platform. Even though she had recorded extensively including all the major concertos, losing her live presence on the concert stage was the saddest deprivation.  But then in 2010, Kyung-wha reemerged and since then has been making a comeback.  This has led to the above mentioned project and recording, the complete Bach Sonatas and Partitas for solo violin. These works represent something so special in the life of a performer. Perhaps they are the zenith of any career but without doubt to record them is something of a unique challenge and privilege.  I listened to this new recording and was deeply impressed and moved by her reading. It should be stated immediately that early music performance practice does not inform these readings at all. This is Bach in romantic style, so don't expect the sort of approach Rachel Podger--a violinist I also greatly admire but for other reasons--gives to Bach. Kyung-wha's reading has a wonderful authenticity, beauty of sound and phrasing and a heroic aspect, which you associate with the great violinists of the past. Maybe there is an echo of Joseph Szigeti with whom she studied in Europe after Julliard. It is a recording we should welcome not just as an addition to the catalogue but also as an announcement of the return of one of the greatest talents of her generation. She will be performing the complete Bach in many recitals around the world over the next few months (in Asia in December and January; in the UK and US in May) and I for one will make certain to attend and hear her play these works that obviously have guided her spirit for so long.   In May 2015 at New England Conservatory of Music in Boston I had the great pleasure of awarding Kyung-wha an Honorary Degree for her services to music, an award that she received with charm and humility. But it was the response from the Korean students in seeing her at NEC and having her on the stage of Jordan Hall, that was truly remarkable. She was greeted as their hero, their inspiration, a legend, a shining example of violinistic talent, and most notably the first from their country to conquer the world and find a place on the international stage. Many of these Korean students have talked with me about the gender and racial prejudices that they still encounter in the music world. Their stories fill me full of disappointment at the behavior of others. I do not know if Kyung-wha experienced this as well when she forged her early career, but as the first, she remains the inspiration for this new younger generation of wonderfully gifted artists who have hopes similar to hers in 1967.  After receiving her Honorary Doctorate she sat on stage with the other recipients and members of faculty demonstrably enjoying the positive energy that makes any Commencement Day so very special. One young musician from Seoul as he walked past her onstage to receive his degree just could not resist the moment and stopped to take a selfie with her. She seemed to relish every second of this inclusive and humorous act of total opportunism. It was my favorite part of the day and loved by everyone. I am so delighted that this great artist and her joyous musical spirit are back with us wanting to play and contribute as much as ever."

ARTS & CULTURE,"Dallas Is Where I Finally Get to See The Famous French ""Déjeûner sur L'herbe"" Painting By Monet"," Dallas-Fort Worth. One could possibly think that the Dallas-Fort Worth appellation is just an indication of a big twin megapolis, when in fact, as I discovered Sunday, it's two very distinct cities, not even remotely touching, with a Grand Prairie in-between - grande prairie means large field in French. So it took me an hour to drive from Dallas to Fort Worth Arts District to reach the Kimbell Museum.

Needless to say, I was starving when I reached the museum. True fact is that I always eat first at art exhibits, firstly because I am always starving, and secondly because museums have the best cafés and shops. The Kimbell has a unique flat rate fee for plates of three sizes - small, medium, and large. The menu is the same for all. But you pay by the size of your plate. Some people have mastered the art of piling up tons of food in a precarious balance on their plate. I saw some lunchers with a small plate who had more food than me on my medium one. Was it ""worth"" it? But I digress. Claude Monet is one of these great French painters that everyone knows. They may not know his name but will recognize his art. He is a familiar painter with a subdued and sweet domestic life that accompanied his paintings all his life. His paintings of Venice, London, and Paris are vital witnesses to the cities' daily landscapes. Organized in collaboration with the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, thanks to loans from 10 countries, and a handful of private collectors, the show offers a unique view of the early years of the master, starting when he was 17 years old and painted the ""View at Rouelles"" where he lived. All the paintings presented at the Kimbell are from Monet's early years and have seldom been seen in museums. The precious exhibit is a must-see for lovers of impressionists' work. Le Déjeûner sur l'Herbe. My favorite Monet piece is the whimsical lunch on the grass, for its romantic setting, the fashion so beautifully described, and the funky story of its missing part. You will only see two pieces of this large painting at the Kimbell, as this is the only remaining parts of the massive representation of a lunch in the woods. Monet explained how the painting got cut up and subsequently gone shorter: ""I had to pay my rent, I gave it to the landlord as security and he rolled it up and put in the cellar. When I finally had enough money to get it back, as you can see, it had gone moldy.""

When his landlord finally gave it back, Monet cut it up and kept only three pieces - but the third part has now disappeared. Pricey grain stacks. The auction house Christie in New York just sold last week the piece ""Grain stack"" for a hefty $81.4 million, when the hope was to sell it for half of that. I won't tell you who bought it, because it's a secret - the 1891 canvas was won by an anonymous collector bidding over the telephone. The wheat stack sold is not at the Kimbell, but a couple of the series of about 20 stacks canvases are on view - better hurry to see them before they sell for millions and vanish into some lucky private living room!  Another Monet had already set a record for the painter; his ""Water Lily Pond"" was sold for $80.4 million in 2008. The 19-part elliptical painting of the ""Nymphéas"" is another familiar sight for many. A special studio was built for the size of his project, and he devoted the rest of his life to the large masterpiece. We are treading far away from cutting up paintings to pay the rent! If only Monet could see the frenzy of collectors around his art today. Claude Monet was a great impressionist master - good at drawing, and even better at rendition of material such as clouds, water, and snow. Friends with Renoir, his flowers show the influence the other master had on him. "" Qu'y a-t-il à dire de moi ? Que peut-il y avoir à dire, je vous le demande, d'un homme que rien au monde n'intéresse que sa peinture - et aussi son jardin et ses fleurs ?"" (What is there to say about me? What can possibly be said, I am asking you, about a man that nothing in the world interests except his painting - and also his garden, and his flowers?)   More info:

ARTS & CULTURE,"On Jan Fabre, part 2: Scenes from the Moral Education of the Human Race","This second article in my series about the absurdly productive trans-national art star Jan Fabre (the first is here) has very little to do directly with him or his work. Rather, it is about the State Hermitage Museum, one of the wonders of the world. We take a look at it because it is on this field which Fabre agreed to stake a claim. The Hermitage is interesting in itself, but it is also difficult to evaluate Fabre's work in his sprawling solo show ""Knight of Despair/Warrior of Beauty"" without some sense of the museum in which it is set. As in real life, there is too much of the Hermitage for it to be adequately covered in any one session. How can I tell you the entire story of the thrones and crimson cloth, the robot peacocks and gold chandeliers, the frescoed arches and dim forgotten halls? I can't, and I saw only the tiniest fraction of it myself.
Jordan Staircase at dusk, Winter Palace, State Hermitage Museum Therefore we narrow our view to a few of the masterpieces in this realm of wonders, and let them stand for the rest. A museum with these alone would be enough. But of course there is endlessly more to the real thing. The first is Rembrandt's The Return of the Prodigal Son. I have written about this painting before, but now I've seen it for myself. Here is what I had to say previously: ""Consider for a moment the father and son in Rembrandt's The Return of the Prodigal Son. Having returned to his father, the son kneels, clothes tattered, one foot bare where his shoe has fallen apart. He slumps against his father, head shaven and bowed, eyes closed. The father hunches over the son, bowed as well, worn with age and concern, blinded by his emotion. He has returned to the realm of touch: he rests his hands on his son's shoulders, in an all-encompassing gesture of relief, of forgiveness and ingathering. It is impossible to look at this painting without being struck blind, like the father, and awakened to the inner truths it conveys: that we are all going home, that we all need to be forgiven and don't deserve it - and that we are all waiting for those who have left, and that we have already forgiven them for their part in whatever it was that drove us apart.""
Rembrandt, The Return of the Prodigal Son, 1668 Having seen it for myself, I have only one thing to add: the prodigal son really does look just like my friend Max Ritvo, an accomplished poet who passed away in August at the age of 25. Max's chemotherapy stole his hair, as the prodigal son's hair is lost. Max's face was tall and thin, with a strong jaw, prominent cheekbones, and a sharp nose, like Rembrandt's prodigal son. Like Rembrandt's prodigal son, Max tended to tuck his head into a hug. Like the prodigal son in the Gospel of Luke, Max was wealthy - in talents and gifts: knowledge, humor, wit, eloquence. And like Luke's prodigal son, Max had to abandon all his riches and return, though he would object to the phrasing, to his Father. Max isn't here to object, so I can phrase it as I please. The hands that embrace the prodigal son need not be that Father's in particular. They could be anyone's. They could be mine. These things I thought when I looked at this painting, which is enormous, and also mighty, in person at the Hermitage.
detail, Rembrandt, The Return of the Prodigal Son Let us turn to another Rembrandt at the Hermitage, Sacrifice of Isaac. Rembrandt evokes the drama of the scene with a painfully vertical composition - Isaac below Abraham below angel. Each figure is connected to the others by the hands - Abraham's left hand covers Isaac's face, and the angel's hand pulls Abraham's right hand, his killing hand, away. The angel's other hand rises up toward heaven, whence his order came. As for Isaac, with his oddly womanish chest, his hands are bound beneath him and invisible. The hands rise from powerlessness toward power in this arcing vertical composition. At the mid-level, from Abraham's killing hand, the knife is falling. The painting catches it mid-air. An instant of time passes in Sacrifice of Isaac, short enough for that knife to appear suspended in empty space.
Rembrandt, Sacrifice of Isaac, 1635 Consider first the psychology of this painting, especially of that hand covering Isaac's face. It has several meanings. First, it is a utilitarian gesture: pushing back the head, as if Isaac were a farm animal, exposes his neck and chest to the blade. Second, it is a gesture of mercy: though Abraham operates under the necessity of God's cruel order, he retains the freedom to spare his son the sight of the descending knife, to impotently attempt to spare him some measure of terror, of hopelessness. And finally, it is a gesture of self-preservation: Abraham cannot bear to look Isaac in the face as he murders him. In hiding his face, he already makes his son into a thing. It is just about possible to apply the blade to a thing, but not to his son, surely not his son. We did the same in gross anatomy: a linen shroud over the face of the cadaver, and these were the bodies of strangers already dead, on whom we worked with our scalpels, but the linen helped, even so. Above psychology, however, is philosophy. This is a painting of a turning point in the history of civilization and religion: the emergence of a god who rejects human sacrifice. Before the god of Abraham is the savage age of Moloch and Taranis and Huitzilopochtli - not ""before"" chronologically, but morally before, eons before. Before the god of Abraham, human beings are treated as objects, as instruments of utility. Everything miraculous about them may be demanded as a burnt offering to the god. The god creates, and devours his creation. I believe the Elohim who sends Abraham up that awful Mount Moriah is the same kind of monster as those forgotten older gods. But the Yahweh who sends the angel to stop him is a god horrified at his own command, a god who can learn and has learned. After Moriah, there is a better way. Men begin to worship an asymmetric god, a god who creates but is constrained from destroying. After Isaac, the life of man is an end in itself. It is no longer available as the meal of the divine. We take this for granted, and have taken it for granted for thousands of years. But all good ideas have a beginning. We do well not to forget. Rembrandt has not forgotten. His mastery of light and dark, of composition and anatomy, allows him to express his deep understanding of psychology. His psychology, in turn, serves to illustrate his insight into the philosophy of god and man. A sufficiently good artwork is not an artwork. It is a truth, and not just any truth, but a truth of the most utter and necessary kind. Behold da Vinci's Benois Madonna, the Madonna and child with flowers, that dear, dear painting:
Leonard Da Vinci, Benois Madonna, 1478 Like so much of da Vinci's work, the superficial beauty of the thing is virtually an obstacle to comprehending its greatness (attribution of the painting is disputed; I don't care; it's great even without the Name). Its parts are harmoniously orchestrated into a pleasing whole, its lights and darks swirl around one another, the faces have the exactly-so grace of da Vinci's sense of features. Zoom for a moment into the flowers the infant Jesus is playing with:
detail, Leonard Da Vinci, Benois Madonna They are cruciform flowers. The scene appears lilting and innocent, but da Vinci prefigures the end at the beginning. This is not particularly what makes the painting so special. It is a common trope in Madonna and child paintings. No, what makes the painting special starts, as with Rembrandt, in psychology, and uses psychology as a springboard to moral philosophy. Zoom back a little bit and consider the scene.
detail, Leonard Da Vinci, Benois Madonna, 1478 A very young Madonna is laughing as she holds up the sprig of Cruciferae flowers to Jesus. Her gesture is like her expression: she holds the flowers delicately, with humor. Jesus, on the other hand, is all business. He is before the age at which infants first laugh. He is very serious as he seizes hold of her hand with his left hand, and touches the flowers with his right. He inspects the flowers carefully. This is what play is like at its earliest infant stage - intensely curious, unselfconscious, unsmiling. Jesus's solemn concentration is what has made Mary laugh. She laughs because he's funny, and she loves him, and she's happy. There is absolutely nothing special about this scene. All decent mothers of healthy children have experienced it. Da Vinci minutely observes and records here a thing that happens every single day under every flag in the world. There are many Madonna and child paintings, but very few in which the humanity of Jesus is so adeptly translated into a gesture so common as to be universal, and yet simultaneously miraculous, one of the constant real miracles of life on Earth. This has a meaning. The great lesson of Abraham and Isaac is that no human life should serve any longer as a mere tool of the god. This lesson was learned long ago, but it still demands Rembrandt to teach it to us again, to help us understand its profundity. The great lesson of Mary and Jesus is that each individual human being is precious. No life is the same as another life. We are not fungible. The loss of any one life is a specific and unique tragedy beyond comprehension. Because Jesus condescends to be human, his death is able to stand for all deaths, and not only for all deaths, but for each death. Each death becomes monumental, as his death is monumental. In approaching him, we are forced into individual dignity. This is one of the paths by which he redeems us. Da Vinci teaches this lesson, which also needs to go on being taught, by depicting Mary as just some girl, and Jesus as just a little baby, anybody's baby, hers, mine, yours.  Now look, I'm Jewish, and very proudly so. But I am not parochial in my admirations. What we are talking about here are two of the milestones in the moral history of the human race. The majesty of what we conceive of as human has a long history. It took a lot of building. Isaac and Jesus and their grieving parents helped to get us so far as we have come. And alongside the development of moral philosophy, it was necessary for these discoveries, these innovations, to be taught. Rembrandt and da Vinci are two of the great teachers of humankind, and these paintings we have been talking about are pivotal scenes in the moral education of the human race. They are housed some dozens of yards from one another in the State Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg, Russia. They are among the several reasons it is a wonder of the world. Next time we talk about scientists and magicians, and finally make our way to Jan Fabre. To be continued."
ARTS & CULTURE,Hamilton Brouhaha,"As a man of the theater I am not a big fan of anyone booing anyone - but I am a huge fan of the actor who courageously addressed the soon to be VP and asked him to represent everyone. Not a rude question to ask - not in a democracy. That he even had to ask it is a shame that belongs to Trump and Co. It was a question that flowed naturally from the appointment of Jefferson Beauregard Sessions and others of his ilk. Incidentally, I may sound ungenerous toward Trump voters but I don't think you voted for an overhaul in government - you voted for dirty air and dirty men; you voted for cruelty (the mocking of the man with the neurological disorder) you voted for mysogeny - the man on the bus and the pussy grabbers - you voted for greed - the man who swindled those who took his college courses, and saddest of all you voted for voter repression and racism - toss in a handful of homophobia, a smidgeon of anti-semitism, and fact is folks, you voted for evil. Now all of us are obliged to live with it. But some of us - young and old - will keep protesting it and fighting it as long as we live. Thank you, Hamilton cast members. The theater must treat this government as it did the South African government during apartheid. No, sir, we are not here to entertain you."
ARTS & CULTURE,"Rock-a-bye, Baby: ""Jenůfa"" at the Metropolitan Opera"," There comes a point in her Act II monologue when the Kostelnicka, the moral guardian of a turn-of-the-century mill town in Moravia and the step-mother of the titular Jenůfa, imagines how the villagers will decry her and her stepdaughter when they find out about Jenůfa's illegitimate child. ""Look at her! Look at her! Kostelnicka!"" Well, with the white-knuckled Karita Mattila playing the upright, deeply conflicted Kostelnicka, it simply isn't possible to look away. Leos Janáček's Jenůfa premiered in Brno in 1904 and returned to the Metropolitan Opera on Friday for the first time in ten years. The bleak opera is a fascinating and elegantly-proportioned psychological study that elevates the thorough development of themes of jealousy, shame, and love into an airtight and believable case study. Taken from the play Her Stepdaughter by Gabriela Preissová, the plot revolves around the young, thoughtful Jenůfa who falls in love with and is pregnant by Steva, the heir to a mill. But when her childhood friend Laca slashes her face out of jealousy, Steva abandons Jenůfa, and her image-conscious stepmother, the Kostelnicka, shelters her until the baby is born. Terrified that the baby will stigmatize Jenůfa, the Kostelnicka drowns it in the ice while Jenůfa sleeps and tells her the baby died. The Kostelnicka then brokers the marriage of Jenůfa and Laca, but the body of the baby is discovered by the villagers in the thawing river on the day of the wedding. The Kostelnicka succumbs to her guilt, admits to the deed, and is taken to prison, while Jenůfa, humiliated, tries to release the insistently-committed Laca. The characters all end up about as unhappy as they were at the start of the opera and humdrum village life assumedly goes on.  Returning to the Met for the first time in 5 seasons, Mattila made a tremendous and extraordinarily-paced house-role debut as the crumbling sexton's widow. At age 56, Mattila still commands an easily-produced, soft-grained soprano with a distant pinch that she imbues with an extraordinary intensity, dramatic alertness, and attention to the Czech text. She isn't afraid to cry out or let the voice go white for a moment for effect and the shocking lines of her Act II monologue were both enunciated and screamed to a chilling result as she resolves to kill Jenůfa's son. Her high notes were effortlessly produced and her low notes were impressively secure in what was a welcome and overdue return for the undiminished Finnish soprano.
Unfortunately, though, Mattila was matched nowhere else in the cast, least of all by the Jenůfa of Ukranian Oksana Dyka. Dyka's voice has turned from steely, laser-like focus to an edgy, strident wobble. Though her upper range is more intact and she can still ride the breath effectively, her lower range sounds dull and curdled and she didn't lend the music any of the pastoral lyricism is demands despite attempts at sincere delivery. Not a natural actress, she was majorly undercut by Olivier Tambosi's lackluster-but-inoffensive production that had her spend most of the evening posing near the stage-dominating rock. This Jenůfa wasn't so much a layered, tormented young woman as much as a baleful, shrieking village girl with a penchant for literacy. Her suitors fared better. Daniel Brenna's forceful heldentenor might not have been an ideal fit for Laca, but he sang with a youthful rambunctiousness and acted with commitment to the production which imagined him as more of a playground bully than a predator. Joseph Kaiser took some time to warm up as Steva, but once he did, his singing was confident and his negotiation of Czech even more so. He did sometimes compete to be heard with the orchestra, though, which conductor  David Robertson lead with great attention to the intricacies of Janáček's orchestral writing. The village scenes have a lot of moving parts, and Robertson managed them with ease and even scaled down his approach for the intimate Act II. That said, his conducting was taut, exciting, and tense the entire evening. The superb Metropolitan Opera Orchestra adroitly responded accordingly and the Chorus sounded in top shape. Other standouts of the cast included the indispensable Ying Fang whose distant, pearly soprano was a delight as Jano, Hanna Schwarz who sang with commitment and worn tone as the Grandmother Buryja, and Bradley Garvin who balanced generous phrasing and beautiful tone in his short appearance as the foreman. Frank Philip Schlössmann's geologically-inspired sets and subdued costumes got the job done.  Jenůfa runs through November 17th at the Metropolitan Opera and you'd be silly to miss Karita Mattila doing what she does best (besides the splits). Tickets available here.

ARTS & CULTURE,"First Nighter: Kenneth Branagh in John Osborne's ""The Entertainer,"" Kemp Powers's Thrilling ""One Night in Miami...,"" Peter Shaffer's ""Amadeus"" Undone,"" ""How to Hide a Lion"" for Kids","London--Comparisons might be odious, but Kenneth Branagh invites them.  Over several decades he's assumed classic roles associated with Laurence Olivier.  His Henry V and Hamlet were unquestionably Olivier-worthy.  Now, however, he's playing Archie Rice (for another two weeks) in John Osborne's The Entertainer, at the Garrick and as the conclusion to his Kenneth Branagh Theatre Company year. It could be argued that Archie Rice was the great performance of Olivier's later career.  I'd certainly make that argument vigorously.  As the aging music hall performer, Olivier--frequently at his best when playing a ham (watch him in Sleuth, for instance--pulled out every last stop.  His Archie Rice was someone far past his prime, a prime that probably was not much of a prime anyway.  His on-setting desperation was visible in the song-and-dance routine that began the play. Branagh starts with a deft tap routine executed in Neil Austin's hazy lighting and augmented by four dancing cuties.  Immediately, Archie Rice's cheap turn, as Osborne plants it, is fudged.  That's the start of director Rob Ashford's undercutting the playwright's music-hall metaphor--of the fading post-World War II music hall as a metaphor for the United Kingdom's post-war fade. Yes, it looks as if Ashford, who started his career as a choreographer, is the explanation for this misguided look at The Entertainer, although since Branagh and he have been a team for a while now, Branagh can surely be assumed to be in agreement with all decisions made.  (Chris Bailey and Pip Jordan are credited as, respectively choreographer and associate choreographer of the numbers.)  Osborne alternates the song-and-dance turns (Branagh has a strong voice, though he's not always pitch-perfect, perhaps deliberately) with Archie at home alongside his accommodating wife Phoebe (Greta Scacchi, very effective), father Billy Rice (Gawn Grainger, still an on-stage powerhouse), son Frank (Jonah Hauer-King) and nubile Jean Rice (Sophie McShera) for whom Archie makes a baleful play. Somehow, these sequences seem diluted as well, the view of a troubled England surprisingly pallid.  Perhaps 60 years on, Osborne's script is partially responsible for the lack of urgency.  Nevertheless, the overall result is disappointing. What's no letdown is Christopher Oram's set which melds the music hall with the Rice home so that at no time is Archie's squalid professional life absent from the mundane family activity.
******************
Kemp Powers's One Night in Miami... has already played Baltimore, Denver and Los Angeles, but it may be the sold-out Donmar Warehouse entry, directed by Baltimore Center Stage artistic director Kwame Kwei-Armeh, that guarantees Manhattan and across-the-land sightings. It's 1963 and Cassius Clay (Sope Dirisu) has just defeated Sonny Liston for the world heavyweight title.  He's returned to his hotel room to celebrate with good pals Sam Cooke (Arinzé Kene), Jim Brown (David Ajala) and Malcolm X (Francois Battiste), while Nation of Islam guards Kareem (Dwane Walcott) and Jamaal (Josh Williams) keep watch in the corridor. Don't look here for confirmation of the personnel present on that historic evening.  Just know that Kemp has assembled four men important to the black community. They're men whose disparate attitudes have the capacity to influence a wide population. Malcolm X is among them because the following morning Clay will announce he's becoming a Muslim and henceforth will be known at Muhammad Ali.  How that goes down with the others is the thrust of Powers's powerful 90-minute drama.  For instance, Brown, who's just made his first movie, won't convert, since that would mean giving up his grandmother's pork chops. While the men wrangle over their different positions, perhaps the crucial entanglement is between Malcolm X and Sam Cooke.  The former, who just then happens to be out of favor with the Nation of Islam, believes the latter could be doing more for his people than writing benign love songs, and in the heated discussion that follows Cooke singing ""You Send Me"" and ""A Change is Going to Come"" earns whopping audience approval. Before the 90-minute play ends, Powers has delivered a subtle lecture on racial intolerance that existed then and still does today--as, at a crucial moment, a projected image of Donald J. Trump attests.
******************
At first it might seem as if director Michael Longhurst has decided to deconstruct Peter Shaffer's Amadeus, at the National's Olivier, where it started in 1979.  To play the Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart music mentioned throughout the script, he dispatches 20 members of the Southbank Sinfonia all over the expansive stage. The idea is that whenever Antonio Salieri (Lucian Msamati) hears Mozart in his head as he reads the scores, the audience gets to hear it played right there in front of them.  Poor Salieri.  Even while he remains the acknowledged musical genius of the world ruled by Joseph II (Tom Edden), very imperious), he has to admit to himself that it's younger cut-up Mozart (Adam Gillen) who will live in perpetuity. Up to the point where Salieri hears his first Mozart serenade, Longhurst's approach seems big but not overblown. Salieri's response to what he experiences as exquisite physical pain does capture something rarely articulated about the effect of great music. But later Longhurst feels the need to build on Salieri's reactions to the scores as he peruses them, and that's where the production goes wildly wrong.  To end the first act Shaffer provides a scene in which Salieri, already considering himself the apex of mediocrity, scans several sheets of music and realizes that, though he's conscientiously devoted himself to his writing, he's woefully deficient when compared to the young whippersnapper, and his attempts to ruin Mozart's life ultimately disastrous.. The carrying-on that Longhurst has Msamati go through is unconscionable--such breast-beating and flailing and sobbing and collapsing.  Surely, this is not what Shaffer, who died this year at 90, had in mind.  These tortured shenanigans are hardly a tribute to him.  Nor is Gillan's outlandish performance, contorting himself as he constantly does, at one point hanging upside down from the piano frequently rolled on and off Chloe Lamford's striking, hulking steel-grey set. The result is that what initially looks to be a deconstruction is more a con and a destruction.  Where what the subtle Amadeus requires in direction is a Mozart counterpart, what it receives is a Salieri treatment.

ARTS & CULTURE,From Russia (To Paris) With Love!," For several decades split between the Hermitage and the Pushkin museums in Russia, the incredible Shchukin collection is arriving in the French capital.

Considered one of the world's finest collections of modern art, it will go on view outside of Russia for the first time in nearly 100 years at the Fondation Louis Vuitton art center in Paris. Sergei Shchukin was a successful late 19th-century Russian businessman in the textile industry. Born in 1854 in Moscow, he died in 1936 in Paris. Starting in 1897 during a visit to Paris, he began collecting paintings from the masters of Impressionism.  His first purchase was a Monet. Then he went on to the Russian avant-garde artists, filling the walls of his Moscow house with more than 250 pieces. An entire room of his Moscow mansion was dedicated to his 16 Gauguin Tahiti paintings.  Famed Monet's Le Déjeuner sur l'Herbe , Picasso's La Buveuse d'Absinthe , Matisse's L'Atelier Rose, are just a few of the masterpieces that made it to the museum in Paris.  Braque, Renoir, Degas, Van Gogh, Cézanne, Pissarro, are among the other 50 masters represented by the collection. After many great losses in his personal life - the death of his wife, his teenage son, Sergei, his brother and his youngest son -Shchukin pursued his art collecting with even greater fervor; he opened his residence, the Trubetskoy Palace, to art students and gave tours of his collection.   After the Bolshevik Revolution of October 1917, his priceless collection was dismantled and handed to the powerful state, then distributed to several museums in Moscow and Saint Petersburg.  The art was labeled ""bourgeois and cosmopolitan"" by purgist dictator Joseph Stalin, who was in office from April 1922 to October 1952 and considered the art collection to be too decadent to be shown to the public. After the revolution, Shchukin fled to France and became a close friend and a patron of Henri Matisse. He went on to commission La Danse (seen above, 1909-10), and La Musique (1910), two of the artist's most celebrated works. A real art coup for the Fondation, the exhibit is likely to attract visitors from all over the world. Opened since exactly two years the Frank Gehry-designed building sits in the middle of the suburban woods at the door of Paris, encroached to the delightful Jardin d'Acclimatation inside the Bois de Boulogne, in the fancy 16th arrondissement of Paris.  Sponsored by the group LVMH (Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton), the center is run as a nonprofit initiative, as part of LVMH's promotion of art and culture.  Bernard Arnault, the Chairman of LVMH, was the definite mastermind behind the Shchukin travel to France. For many years, French André-Marc Delocque-Fourcaud, Shchukin's 74-year-old grandson,  has been wanting to re-unite the collection for a complete show, but he found no museum in Russia or France with the hefty funds to see it through.

After many secret shenanigans, the deal was made official when the French magnate signed the agreement with the Russian foreign ministry, as well as the Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg, and the Pushkin Museum in Moscow to bring the entire collection together again in its entirety for a magnificent show.  ""For me, it's a big event,"" Arnault said recently, ""the collection is one of the most beautiful that has ever been put together. It is a complete vision of the beginning of contemporary art.""

ARTS & CULTURE,BB9: The Art of Collaboration and the Third Mind,"
The slick logo and double-tasking mother/yogi sums up the birth of a new, unified design of Berlin surmounting the struggles of integration.  (photo: bb9 logostroller © Berlin Biennale for Contemporary Art). Berlin, as a city that is recreating itself from a 360 perspective, is the ideal location for a new dialectic of art based on the Third Mind of collaboration. The Berlin Biennale for Contemporary Art (BB9) venues illuminate Berlin's recent history as a bisected city...

 The Berlin location of ""The Present in Drag"" is a chief determinant of the contents of a biennale flush with funding and in a rare situation of being able to commission the artworkto create a uniform slick style. In providing a visual uniformity under the banner of Uncertainty, BB9 fulfills its goals spectacularly.  ""The Present in Drag"" is a catchy title that seems to divert interpretation even as it loads meaning of the present in which the only certainty is a new phase in the gender wars--towards a Third transgender reality which only adds to the uncertainty of a humanity born into duality. Water is a prominent theme in the exhibition, in which the basement of KDW was immersed in water for a projection of a ""drag"" performance and a boat ride.  ""The feeling you get when you realized Internet access is a human right but water isn't.""  That one line, as included in the list of anxieties at the technology installation in the ESMT, the former council of the DDR, sums up the underlying quest of the Third Mind.   The promise of the Aquarian Age is here -- the Third Mind arising out of collaboration which is the collective of four -- three men and one woman (Lauren Boyle with
Solomon Chase, Marco Roso and David Toro) comprising DIS, the founders of a multimedia online platform curating this multi-venue BB9 as their premiere exhibition.   The promise of technology to create a unified world is also present. The theme takes hold in the ESMT main exhibition presenting new ""global design"" initiatives into the iconic postage stamp.  Yet such modern iconography is accessed through the ancient reminders of the ongoing cycles of destruction and resurrection...
Katja Novitskova's  ""Neolithic Potential (fire worship, yellow horns)"", 2016 is a primal reminder of the cycles that the technology, with its pride of linear progression, cares to forget.(Foto/Photo: Timo Ohler).  This is one of many juxtapositions defying the logical mind revealing the magic that comes from the Third Mind in teasing out themes from the unconscious.  This is where Uncertainty dominates the consciousness and Uncertainty is precisely the place where humanity needs to surrender to in order to find that leftover piece to inspire the future. Arising from the anxiety surrounding from Uncertainty are new permissions to collaborate with commerce, that is placed right in the thirst of the visitor, on a hot summer's day to Akademie del Kuenste where a refreshing Mint drink is advertised and on display but not being sold.

Playing with perception is the tropical island created inside the building and the collaborations with fashion that literally put you into bed with the gap created from the breakdown between boundaries of commerce and art. One expected to see price tags on the fashion items.

....opposing the Yngve Holen's ""Window Seat"" the repeating identical glass object reminiscent of an airplane window that the label tells us is derived from a universal icon of the ""evil eye"" in an attempt to be iconic on its own, complete with a label revealing points of purchase (Installation View Foto/Photo: Timo Ohler) The center of this venue is a repeating mantra: ""COVER YOUR TRACKS"".  Here is a text/image reminder that no matter what you fondle or purchase, Big Brother is taking account, as it certainly is in Korpys/Loffler's ""Transparenz, Kommunickation"" two channel video installation smashing up surveillence with Occupy documentation in a repeating phrase of watchfulness. The transparency of the architecture with the constant presence of the surveillance camera sums up the dissolving surfaces of modern life.  The anxiety arising from this breakdown of boundaries, --not only between the digtial and the physical but art/design, art/commerce, art/entertainment and the personal/public--is the culmination of an (r)evolution taking place since the dada movement reacted to the devastation of World War I. The breakdown confounds the mind in regards to the eternal question:  WHAT IS ART? This is a necessary question to be asking as reality structures breakdown in 2016, leaving humanity open to either a major leap into a new paradigm in which the opposites are united or a devastation that Carl Jung warned would come about as a split between the opposites.  Clearly, BB9, by its very design, offers no concrete answers, only the dissolution accompanied by anxiety and new opportunities for definition arising with the breakdown of known structures as an underlying theme of the return.   The theme of anxiety accompanying our present epoch of Uncertainty was repeated in Berlin Art Week.  Ann Imhof's abysmal ""ANGST II"" collaborative ""opera"" at the Hamburger Bahnhof left a single lasting impression of the tension of the times: a tightrope walker. A floating anxiety made real through material of infection contributed by the white ""fog"" in the gallery leads to new discussion about what is art on the verge of a new paradigm.  Where only one participant had a recognizable name, Adrian Piper, cropping up like a repeating joke...
The iconic greeting from the most recognizable artist ""brand"" in the exhibition begs the post-Warhol question.  ""Howdy #6 [Second Series]"", 2015 (Mounted projection onto a closed door at the end of a darkened hallway © APRA Foundation Berlin. Installation View Foto/Photo: Timo Ohler).
 If everyone who declares themselves an artist can claim a micro-celebrity status through the social network and an online DIS platform, what is the purpose of the art exhibition? This review proposes that it is a public opportunity to enter the Third, a conscious embrace of the current state of Uncertainty, that reaps the rewards of the transbinary form as formulation... ...""The Present in Drag"".

ARTS & CULTURE,"Hats, Apples, Umbrellas, A Pipe That Is Not A Pipe: Magritte, The Magician Of Art."," The Museum. Close to celebrating its 40th anniversary (in February 2017) the Centre Pompidou Museum in Paris is continuing to offer important and vibrant retrospectives of famous painters and crafters, as well as still launching many careers of less-known artists. The colorful industrial-looking museum, controversial at first when it opened in the heart of Paris and made some people cry in visual pain, while others clapped in delirious support, as the building was deemed ""unfinished"", ""shocking"", ""vulgar"", the ugly scar in the middle of beautiful classic architectural surroundings. It stood the test of time, and 40 years later, the seven-story structure of metal and pipes stills draws controversy and very opinioned rants about its location, architectural style, and place in a city of beauty.  Designed and built by architects Renzo Piano, Richard Rogers, and Gianfranco Franchini, the massive arts complex was renovated in 2000, and won the Pritzker Prize in 2007, as its jury noted that the Pompidou ""revolutionized museums, transforming what had once been elite monuments into popular places of social and cultural exchange, woven into the heart of the city.""
 The Artist. Who does not know René Magritte? The Belgian philosopher/surrealist/manipulative artist who gave us a laugh with a chicken looking at a soft-boiled egg, or a hat without a head resting on a stiff shirt collar.  Or perhaps it was a green apple face under a bowler hat, or maybe the multiple umbrella men floating in the sky above a city.  Whatever it is you remember most about his art, it is surely a dream-like image, a fiction, a distortion of the senses, a naïve and elaborate visual made of everyday things and objects. Magritte was good at that, a prince of silly matters, a master of deception and a player of subtlety. The often enchanting world of Magritte offers adults and children alike a new way to look at art - a non-serious view of what a fantasy universe would be like. Magritte and Dali were both painters of perfection in a very silly kind of style, and their polished work seduced and endure in the hearts of their viewers as cherished pieces of wonderful memories. ""Magritte engaged in a sort of theoretical battle with philosophers,"" said Didier Ottinger, the curator of the exhibition at Beaubourg, ""to prove that pictures can portray thoughts on the same level as words could."" Magritte (1898-1967) lived all his life, and died, in Belgium, except for three years spent in France among other painters.  He was tied to the Communist Party, but was very critical of the cultural policy of the left, stating that: ""Class consciousness is as necessary as bread, but that does not mean that workers must be condemned to bread and water and that wanting chicken and champagne would be harmful. "" INFO: Magritte. ""La trahison des images"" (""The Treachery Of Images"")
